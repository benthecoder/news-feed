          "description": "Last month, we open-sourced Infisical (https://github.com/Infisical/infisical) - a simple, end-to-end encrypted tool to sync environment variables across your team and infrastructure. You can use it to store environment variables and inject them into your applications locally or into CI/CD and production infrastructure. It can be used with any language/framework and is platform independent with a super easy setup.\nWe know secret managers exist but, in our experience, they’re too complicated, not comprehensive, not user-friendly, or a mix of all three — other nicer ones are closed-source and don’t have self-hosted options available. That’s why we’re on a mission to make secret management more accessible to every developer — not just security teams.\nWe’ve launched this repo under the MIT license so any developer can use the tool. The goal is to not charge individual developers. We make money by charging a license fee for some future enterprise features as well as providing a hosted version and support.\nIn the coming weeks, we plan to add features like key rotation, access logs + more integrations. We’d love to hear your thoughts and any feature requests!\nGive it a try (https://github.com/Infisical/infisical), and let us know what you think!\nMain website: https://infisical.com/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34055132\nPoints: 165\n# Comments: 77",

          "description": "Hello, I am trying to train an existing RoBERTa model variant in my own language (czech), to generate text, based on a prompt. I have a dataset of about 70 books prepared and formatted in plain text, but now I am faced with the issue of loading the data for additional training of the already pretrained model (the model I am using is called robeczech-base). When I tried using\n dataset = LineByLineTextDataset( tokenizer=tokenizer, file_path=\"./dataset.txt\", block_size=512 ) \n I get an error with the index being out of range, which, after some research, seems to indicate that my dataset has a vocabulary size out of the range of the one the model was trained on. This leads me to believe that my method of loading the single plaintext file into a dataset might be incorrect. I wasn't able to find many tutorials on this subject, since most assume the use of a labeled dataset, or multiple datasets for training and testing, which don't seem like they apply to my situation, since I want the model to generate text similar to the ones it has in my dataset, not classify it in some way for question answering (the dataset contains mostly classic fantasy literature in my native language).\n Do you have any idea of what I am doing wrong? Is my approach completely incorrect? Is a RoBERTa like-model even suited for this task? Do you have any resources, pertaining to long-form text generation (aka. short stories) tutorials and guides, that I could use? I have been stuck for about a week, so any help would be much appreciated :)\n    submitted by    /u/Maty_the_Red  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Every 6 months or so I test AI to see how much it has learned about sandponics/iAVs, the last 6 months have seen a big improvement, but unfortunately there is still a LOT of child level mistakes.\n If I ask what sandponics is, I get an average answer. 12 months ago it wouldn't have a clue......it is getting better, but when you ask for deeper info it fails majorly.\n My question is, can I take research papers and upload them to AI, and then get some useful info out of it? I don't mean summary or alternative text, is AI ready to understand or is it still too young?\n It seems like it can be 'tricked' by asking the same question in different ways AI will provide different answers.\n    submitted by    /u/djdefenda  \n [link]   [comments]",
