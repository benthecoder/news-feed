The main selling point is the result quality / ordering, with best-in-class memory overhead and excellent performance being bonuses. The API is pretty stable at this point, but looking for feedback before committing to 1.0.\nTL;DR\nThe test corpus is a 4MB json file with 162k words/phrases, so give it a second for initial download. You can also drag/drop your own text/json corpus into the UI to try it against your own dataset.\nLive demo/compare with a few other libs (there are many more in the codebase, in various states of completion, WIP):\nhttps://leeoniya.github.io/uFuzzy/demos/compare.html?libs=uF...\nIn isolation for perf assessment:\nhttps://leeoniya.github.io/uFuzzy/demos/compare.html?libs=uF...\nTo increase fuzziness and get broader results, try setting intraMax=1 (core) and enable outOfOrder (userland):\nhttps://leeoniya.github.io/uFuzzy/demos/compare.html?libs=uF...\nAlso play with the sortPreset selector to swap out the default Array.sort() for one in userland that prioritizes typehead-ness (the resultset remains identical).\nStill TODO:\n  - Example of stripping diacritics\n  - Example of using non-latin charsets\n  - Example of prefix-caching to improve typeahead perf even further\n  - Example of poor man's document search (matching multiple object properties)\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33035580\nPoints: 92\n# Comments: 21",

          "description": "The past three weeks I've been massaging the data a lot to get the best set of clusters to represent the customers we have.\n To start, RFM represents:\n  \nR = Number of days since last purchase for a given customer relative to today\n F = Total orders made by customer - 1 (we exclude the first order, we only care about repeat purchases)\n M = Average dollar spent across all orders per customer\n  \nI started with the three as my features, but later expanded and added additional elements such as age of customer, standard deviation between transactions, and average time between transactions.\n My challenge is the frequency data, where the data is extremely right skewed (exponential graph, where 70% of customers representing 2 purchases made, 15% representing 3 purchases made, etc.)\n I think I resolved the skewness with creating a feature that's Log(Monetary x Frequency) - As customers buy more items, the value increases, therefore \"pushing away\" infrequent customers.\n Management want 3 customer segments categorized as \"High, Mid, Low\". However, elbow method and Yellow bricks recommended 5 clusters, \n I've tried three clustering methods:\n  \nKMeans with all features combined\n Gaussian Mixture Model - I selected this method given the high density of frequency cohorts\n Naive KMeans - take the RFM columns only, and run KMeans for each feature alone. Then find the average of each cluster, and score manually to bucket the clusters into High, Mid, Low (for example, a cluster with low R, high F, and high M gets to be the High Value customer cluster)\n  \nI want to ask to ask if there's anyone with Customer Analytics that I can consult with on whether there's a benefit to each approach, or if you have recommendations on a different approach\n    submitted by    /u/forbiscuit  \n [link]   [comments]",

One is not technical at all, management consulting at a Big4 firm vs a quantitative analyst role at a financial company (they make tools for investors). \n I interned with Deloitte freshmen year and really enjoyed consulting work. I'm majoring in data science with a math minor; however, business and general strategy really appeals to me along with interacting with lots of people. I'm not the most technically savvy person in regards with coding, but do enjoy general problem-solving. Not quite sure which to choose... Deloitte is paying approximately $15/hr more though, and I'm a broke college student. \n Which would be the best for my career progression?

          "description": "Hi all,\n I am a Data Analyst and trying to gain a basic understanding of Apache Spark and have been stuck on some technical definitions of this framework, particularly its most advanced technique: distributed computing. \n As PySpark is introduced as a better solution for large datasets over Pandas (as it runs on 1 computer), if I execute a script, where is it running on actually? I only have one PC, what distributed computers in this case means? \n I need some English explanations for this topic as all I google out were technical terms.\n    submitted by    /u/vietnpv  \n [link]   [comments]",
