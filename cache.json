          "description": "So after years of using Stata I have decided, in recent months to switch to Python, for obvious reasons. Although I am an economist, I feel comfortable coding, since I have been using Javascript as a hobbyist for >10 years, and I instantly fell in love with Python's simplicity.\n And yet, when attempting to use Python to do my job, i.e. mainly run a bunch of regressions with different model specifications, I find myself missing Stata terribly. It just feels so much easier to make tweaks to models and run them over and over again with Stata, as is so often needed on a day-to-day basis.\n Just to be clear, I have tried really hard to switch and I enjoy exploring ML models in Python. Yet when it comes to simple everyday tasks, I still can't resist Stata's seductive call.\n Has anyone else had a similar experience with Python or is it just a matter of moving along the learning curve? Do you use different tools for repetitive everyday tasks and more advanced projects?\n    submitted by    /u/diethni  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Not sure if I worded that correctly in the title. I am a beginner working with stata (because that's what we use in my degree) and I'm doing a little fun project of mine to put the taught stuff into practice.\n Just for fun I thought I want to look at how Olympic medals of a country affect basic economic indicators of said country. The problem I have is that Olympic games only happen every 4 years (I differentiate between summer and winter games) but I am interested in what happens with those economic indicators after the Olympics happened.\n I do not want to use super advanced stuff and actually hoped that it would be possible to just use a VAR model, but I am having a hard time to understand if it is possible and, if yes, then how the data should look to make it possible.\n Would it be fine to basically have the medals variable be a \"seasonal\" one where it's always 0 unless during a year where the olympic games happened? I think that sounds like the best idea currently.\n Now there is a second \"problem\" which I can easily solve, but I'd be really happy if there was an alternative.\n Because the economic indicator data is country specific I need to filter for a country and then do the VAR model where it only explains that country because univariate time series would not allow it otherwise if I understood that correctly. Is that correct? Because I thought of a different idea which is about trying to explain poll data with economic indicators but as there are multiple parties in the country I'd want to look at I'd have to create one regression per party to explain how the indicators affect their polling statistic.\n I hope anything I say makes sense. Would be a wonder though.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Derole  \n [link]   [comments]",
