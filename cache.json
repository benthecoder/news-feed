          "description": "I’ve been out of programming practice and not feeling very motivated for building something real, so I’m looking for programming games that are fun. I’ve tried a few, I think I’d like something that has a REPL or notebook interface as well as or instead of a file-based interface.\nHere are some I’ve tried:\nUsing a general-purpose programming language:\nbitburner - this is quite fun, though there’s quite a lot going on\nhackmud - this seems fun and interesting, though the community is small now. This was my introduction to JS dependency hell.\nSpecial purpose languages:\nThe many Zach-likes - I’ve enjoyed these a lot, but I want something a bit more open than puzzle-y\nElse.heart.break - This was quite fun, but a very slow start and then I broke the quest triggers by skipping right to the end of the game once I got the hacking device.\ncolobot a cool classic educational programming game where you’re an astronaut controlling lots of robots - I remember the missions feeling a lot easier to solve without much programming, but apparently there’s a new mission pack…\nAnyway! Interested to hear your recommendations!",

My company doesn’t to a lot of hardcore ML engineering, so I don’t get a lot of exposure to that, but I do think I have a fair bit of exp. with most data science topics.\n I have some projects from a boot camp I did a few years back, although with working full time I really haven’t really had any “off the clock” meaningful projects I’d want to show off in a job interview since then (besides fiddling some GANs for image generation and some cloud storage for a Minecraft server). Is it really worth adding these old projects that may be a tad more “data-sciency” to my resume if I have a ton of on-the-job examples since (Probably can’t post recent code examples as it’s company generated work)?\n    submitted by    /u/king-toot  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, if I make an image or diagram to succinctly explain each of the physics questions at the end of a textbook chapter (ie, the text prompt), is it possible to generate mostly correct and similar images/diagrams for new input questions (assuming the training images are decently well standardized and formatted).\n I’ve kept up with the latest research that’s come out over the past several months on similar questions—I believe there has been some success with Few-Shot classification.

I have all this data and...I'm struggling to come up with a path ahead. A friend of mine suggested using random forests and classifying them (since it's categorical data: time being \"first period, second period, etc.\" and their \"growth\" is measured as \"new, middle, big\") however, I am unsure how to do this. \n ​\n I did do the random forest and got some values, but they're giving me, as expected, a result like:\n ​\n Company 1 - random forest: 0.98, growth: new, time: second_period\" \n Which...upon looking at it, means nothing to me.

Now let's say I have millions of such sequences of varying length (might be 1 term, might be 1000) and some of them are 'bad'. But their combination matters toward that badness. So I'm baselining and looking for outliers, which should have a high correlation with 'bad' in my dataset. Term might indicate 'badness' in one combination but is totally benign in another.\n So that's our search-space and problem statement. I am not educated in DS. But I understand the basic idea: Correlate traits and relationships of features in one or more data-sets to answer a question / solve a problem. But which features to select?
