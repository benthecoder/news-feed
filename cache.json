My internship ends in December and I think they're most likely going to offer me an extension on my contract but it'll be based on the same pay and to be honest I'm doing really tedious work, nothing remotely related to proper data science. \n I got into data science purely because of my love for solving problems and anything number related so i decided to take a look at a few Strategy Consultant roles because after reading what they do it intrigued me. Fast forward 2 months and i got an offer from PwC as a Strategy Consultant within their Strategy& team ... the pay is almost 10× more, the benefits are amazing and it means i get to travel a bit more. And again, the work genuinely intrigues me. \n Sounds great but for the longest time my heart has been on data science and suddenly I'm in this position where I'm offered either to tough it out as an intern with next to no money for another year with the hopes of being absorbed as permanent or join PwC as a Strategy Consultant and finally make a living for myself ? \n Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Practical_Ad_3334  \n [link]   [comments]",
