          "description": "So I had previously set up my home server with SSH on a high port, and did the port forwarding thing on the firewall so that I can SSH into this system from elsewhere on the Internet.  It worked fine for months.\nAnd then, it stopped working. The router didn’t have a software update as far as I can see. I re-checked everything, but I just can’t initiate a connection to the server from elsewhere on the Internet. It seems like it is filtered somewhere in the ISP’s network.  I can, and possibly will switch ISPs, but in the mean time, I’m looking at other technical options. Though we use the other main ISP for work, and their uptime in the last couple years has been… less than stellar.\nOne option is obviously rent a VPS, and set up a VPN or something, and have the home server connect to that at startup.  I can and have done that in the past, but even a low-cost VPS is $10 USD per month.\nSome of the VPN providers out there have relatively low-cost multi-year deals, so I was looking at one of those. But it wasn’t clear if any of them supported what I wanted to do. I don’t really need to watch Netflix from a different region, I just want access to my server remotely.\nI just wanted to see if anyone else is doing something like this.  Thanks!",

The people, and the lack of autonomy.\nIt invades my evenings, my nights, I spend sometimes hours unable to sleep dreading the next day.\nI don't have any autonomy. I'm treated as a resource to be \"used\". And I work with people I don't respect personally or professionally.\nI have been looking for a way out for a while, but let's just say that quitting or finding another job is NOT an option for now, for the sake of argument - to hopefully get some actionable advice.\nI already stopped caring about my work. But my personality finds it difficult to ignore things that are wrong. Sometimes I look at other colleagues communication with others and it affects me also, I see so much wrong but I can't do anything about it.\nHow can I just stop caring?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33054652\nPoints: 56\n# Comments: 50",

          "description": "Hey,\n I'm working in a startup and I'm running a lot of reports and do data cleanup / wrangling for finance reports. Most of my work I do in python and some Excel here and there.\n That's all fine, but the next evolution is that I want to build systems in which I don't have to run the reports for my colleagues but build some sort of system / UI that makes it easy for them to run their own reports.\n The data flow is not very complex but also not very easy to understand for novices. We have a lot of 3rd party csv files that need to be manipulated, merged and formed into reports.\n My colleagues are tech illiterate. So installing python on their laptops and letting them run scripts is too complex. Writing a UI in python and letting them run self coded .exe files is prevented by IT department of the holding our startup is connected to. \n So I'm searching for a soulution that has a) great data manipulation capability and b) is capable of building nice UI capabilities\n ​\n A typical task looks like this:\n  \nDownload one or more .csv files from a 3rd party tool\n Data Cleanup\n Match the data to entries in our database\n Create various pivot tables\n Loop through the user database and create PDF reports for each user\n  \n​\n I tried building most tools in excel, but boy do I hate this program. I mean... for easy data manipulation and visualisation it's fine, but there's a lot of issues when you start writing a lot of UI\n I thought about PowerBI - does anyone have experience with it? Looks great for even more complex reports, Tableau would also work\n That's a first time I have to choose the infrastructure, so I'd love to hear your opinions!\n    submitted by    /u/Apart_Chair_7151  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m looking to bring my stats knowledge up to par to understand texts like Deep Learning- Goodfellow, PRML, ML A Probabilistic Perspective, etc. \n My background is civil engineering and in undergrad took Calc 1-3, Diff Eq, Linear Algebra and a non-calc based stats 101 type class. When I got my masters in Civil-Transportation I took some stats modeling classes that covered regression (linear, logistic, poisson, negative binomial, etc) pretty heavily using R+NLOGIT.\n At this point my stats knowledge is pretty disjointed and feel like I dont have a solid understanding of the fundamentals. From what I can tell with some research the most popular recommendations I've seen are:\n  \nStatistical Inference- at first glance this book feels way above my level, like I can probably work out some things with effort, but I'll probably need another book to fill in the gaps.\n All of Statistics- Looks solid as a reference for someone who's taken way more stats than I have, super concise but super dry read.\n Mathematical Statistics with Applications(Wackerly)- This is one that feels like could be a possibility\n Introduction to Probability(Blitz)- This feels like the other contender\n  \nSo far books 3 and 4 seem like best options, is there anything else I'm missing or votes one way or another?\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/425trafficeng  \n [link]   [comments]",

To sum it up, it's a neural net that's trained on huge amounts of historical data (millions of records with 1000+ data points) and with several regression outputs. It's not a time series model, although time (date) is one of the data points. The way it's structered, every week the data is updated with the most recent data and I transfer the weights from the latest model and continue training. However, I find it very difficult to evaluate this model if I want to introduce changes or additional data points because of the weights that are being transferred and the size of the model and the time it needs to train. Additionally, it's very resource intensive so it's difficult to train in parallel and see how the output is affected.

He asked me if I wanted to go into teaching and I told him no but that I had thought about being an adjunct eventually, but that it was not my overall goal, and he said that my reasons for doing a PhD were more unclear if I didn’t want to teach. He’s constantly telling me that I have the ideal background for data science/operations research type positions in whatever industry because of my background and work experience (currently working as a data analyst and a research assistant), however, I’m only using these positions as a stepping stone. My actual overall end goal is to end up working in healthcare in a data science roll, and I’ve seen that typically at the entry level I meet the minimum requirements, but if I seek advancement for a lead researcher/lead data scientist position a PhD is really almost necessary.\n Aside from that I really enjoy learning and have thirst for being a pioneer/researcher in the field and with my undergrad I really didn’t feel like I delved enough into the topics I was interested in, which is partly why I wanted to pursue an advanced degree, but even now getting my masters and being halfway through I still feel like I still don’t delve enough into the material, which is another reason why I want to do my PhD.\n So, are my reasons that unclear?

I am looking to start applying to entry level data science roles at the beginning of the new year. In my degree, I took a machine learning, data mining and deep learning class on top of my statistics coursework. \n The issue I have is, during this coursework, most of our assignments consisted of smaller datasets in lower dimensions. I know in the real world I’ll have datasets that may consist of 100s to 1000s of predictors as well GBs to TBs of memory. Im not sure where I can find exposure to datasets as large to practice with. Also, I’m not sure what techniques I can use for proper feature selection. Im aware that to look through and remove any predictors that aren’t relevant to the problem. Also, we can remove any predictors that have 0 variance. After that, I’m a bit stumped on where to go. I know creating plots/ histograms of each predictor will be very time consuming. I know this is one of the most crucial steps in the process so I want to make sure I strengthen this skill. So I guess, in summary here are my questions:\n  \nWhere can I find large datasets to practice?

          "description": "So it looks like this sub has converged to a shared realisation that most DS jobs these days are just glorified BI Analyst roles. All these years I was super stressed that I was somehow incredibly unlucky in how I picked DS jobs, but now I can see that being a SQL monkey is actually the norm. Good.\n I can also understand the sentiment of those who are happy to stay in their boring but overpaid DS / BI jobs with 200k+ TC. But this is not why I made the switch into DS a few years ago - if anything, I was looking for a more exciting technical challenge after a couple of years in a pretty mundane SWE job.\n To those stuck in \"BI\" data science roles but keen to grow - what's your way of giving your brain cells some intellectual stimulation before your job makes you too dumb? Do you still manage to somehow dedicate, say, 20% of your time to something actually interesting? Or is it side projects? Or something else?\n Generally speaking, any pro tips to find joy in Data Science again after years of being a SQL monkey?\n    submitted by    /u/ds9329  \n [link]   [comments]",

I could see a world where you could feed a neural network all the episodes of Seinfeld and it could give you an infinite number of new episodes, all rendered in photo realistic detail. Could be any show, King of Queens, Everybody Loves Raymond, Family Guy, Community. \n You could also have an ai write and generate shows based on current trends with no input from human beings. All the voice work and acting would he generated. Then the show could morph and change in real time based on reception and feedback. \n So how long until those things are realistically possible, or at least close?

Multiple companies and software like such have successfully integrated AI into their products because AI is definitely making work faster and sometimes even better than people in a lot of cases. So my question is, what is stopping companies from implementing AI in web design?\n Apologies if the question seems naive. I'm neither a design expert nor an AI expert. Just a student who was exploring these fields. \n So I was wondering whether AI can boost their design industry in Web development. Can't AI be used to improve landing pages or even create them?
