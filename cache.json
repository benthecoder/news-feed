          "description": "So I had previously set up my home server with SSH on a high port, and did the port forwarding thing on the firewall so that I can SSH into this system from elsewhere on the Internet.  It worked fine for months.\nAnd then, it stopped working. The router didn’t have a software update as far as I can see. I re-checked everything, but I just can’t initiate a connection to the server from elsewhere on the Internet. It seems like it is filtered somewhere in the ISP’s network.  I can, and possibly will switch ISPs, but in the mean time, I’m looking at other technical options. Though we use the other main ISP for work, and their uptime in the last couple years has been… less than stellar.\nOne option is obviously rent a VPS, and set up a VPN or something, and have the home server connect to that at startup.  I can and have done that in the past, but even a low-cost VPS is $10 USD per month.\nSome of the VPN providers out there have relatively low-cost multi-year deals, so I was looking at one of those. But it wasn’t clear if any of them supported what I wanted to do. I don’t really need to watch Netflix from a different region, I just want access to my server remotely.\nI just wanted to see if anyone else is doing something like this.  Thanks!",

          "description": "Howdy HN!\nI find myself testing my ping from time to time, especially when my internet seems wonky while WFH. It feels like there should be an easier way test my ping than puling up a terminal or a complex web app - especially when I'm on my phone or any other device that doesn't have a terminal.\nI figured I should be the change I wish to see in the world and created this super light ping test.\nI also created a latency monitoring solution (https://github.com/cjjeakle/network-monitor), feel free to clone and try it out! I know there are a lot  more mature monitoring solutions out there, but I never did figure out how to set them up. This one is super simple: clone it to some device that's always on, compile it, set up some systemd stuff, and it's ready to rock on port 8180!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33049820\nPoints: 43\n# Comments: 19",

          "description": "This sad sequence of events just happened to a relative, and they're distraught. I haven't used Windows for ~15 years but since it was my area of expertise back then I still get lumbered with these problems. This one really surprised me though.\nThey logged into Windows 7 (I know, upgrade...) and it looked like their files were missing. In a panic, they opened Explorer and searched for their files. They turned up in the search. They just didn't show up in the usual \"My Documents\", \"My Pictures\", \"My Videos\" paths.\nThey decided to move the files \"to the correct place\". And then they shut the computer down.\nThe next time they started it, the same thing happened. This is where I got called in, because this time, the files didn't show up in a search. I told them to turn the computer off immediately and drop it with me.\nCan you guess what happened? Well, check this out:\n- Windows couldn't use their user profile because it was corrupted\n- So it created a temporary profile in \"C:\\Users\\TEMP\". (This wasn't obvious to the user because Explorer hides the 'detail' of the file path and simply shows the username)\n- Unwittingly, when they moved the precious files to the \"correct\" place, they were putting them into a temporary profile.\n- On shutdown, Windows promptly deleted the temporary profile, so \"C:\\Users\\TEMP\" got wiped along with all of the files.\nI was frankly astonished that Windows would drop them into a temporary user profile without dire warnings about its transience. Anyway, now I have to try to recover not only the files, but the directory structures. I'm not even sure it's possible... :(\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33047150\nPoints: 256\n# Comments: 169",

Some colleagues always mention to me that I could always find some work in the US for DS since they are always looking for DS talent. People in the field I've talked to always mention that because I'm young and don't have a family to worry about, I should consider working abroad. I currently reside in Canada and have always wondered about the degree of difficulty it would be to get a job below the border as a Data scientist. Are companies in the US generally open to Canadian talent since getting a work visa is much easier than workers from other countries? Or are US companies who are in need of DS talent averse to foreign talent irrespective of their origin?\n    submitted by    /u/FellowZellow  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have inherited a project of maintaining and improving a large regression model. To sum it up, it's a neural net that's trained on huge amounts of historical data (millions of records with 1000+ data points) and with several regression outputs. It's not a time series model, although time (date) is one of the data points. The way it's structered, every week the data is updated with the most recent data and I transfer the weights from the latest model and continue training. However, I find it very difficult to evaluate this model if I want to introduce changes or additional data points because of the weights that are being transferred and the size of the model and the time it needs to train. Additionally, it's very resource intensive so it's difficult to train in parallel and see how the output is affected. All in all, any tips on how to make this process more friendly?\n    submitted by    /u/MarsupialCreative803  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For a little context, my academic background is a BS in math with a minor in Computer Science.\n I was having my weekly one on one with my thesis advisor for my master’s program (in industrial engineering) and he was telling me what courses I needed to take next semester in the event that I do wish to pursue a PhD (which is eventually what I plan on doing). He asked me if I wanted to go into teaching and I told him no but that I had thought about being an adjunct eventually, but that it was not my overall goal, and he said that my reasons for doing a PhD were more unclear if I didn’t want to teach. He’s constantly telling me that I have the ideal background for data science/operations research type positions in whatever industry because of my background and work experience (currently working as a data analyst and a research assistant), however, I’m only using these positions as a stepping stone. My actual overall end goal is to end up working in healthcare in a data science roll, and I’ve seen that typically at the entry level I meet the minimum requirements, but if I seek advancement for a lead researcher/lead data scientist position a PhD is really almost necessary.\n Aside from that I really enjoy learning and have thirst for being a pioneer/researcher in the field and with my undergrad I really didn’t feel like I delved enough into the topics I was interested in, which is partly why I wanted to pursue an advanced degree, but even now getting my masters and being halfway through I still feel like I still don’t delve enough into the material, which is another reason why I want to do my PhD.\n So, are my reasons that unclear? Or am I probably not conveying this information enough to my advisor?\n    submitted by    /u/throwaway----____  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A little background at me: I am about to graduate with my degree in statistics within the next month. I am looking to start applying to entry level data science roles at the beginning of the new year. In my degree, I took a machine learning, data mining and deep learning class on top of my statistics coursework. \n The issue I have is, during this coursework, most of our assignments consisted of smaller datasets in lower dimensions. I know in the real world I’ll have datasets that may consist of 100s to 1000s of predictors as well GBs to TBs of memory. Im not sure where I can find exposure to datasets as large to practice with. Also, I’m not sure what techniques I can use for proper feature selection. Im aware that to look through and remove any predictors that aren’t relevant to the problem. Also, we can remove any predictors that have 0 variance. After that, I’m a bit stumped on where to go. I know creating plots/ histograms of each predictor will be very time consuming. I know this is one of the most crucial steps in the process so I want to make sure I strengthen this skill. So I guess, in summary here are my questions:\n  \nWhere can I find large datasets to practice? (I love kaggle for smaller datasets but it doesn’t seem to have many in large dimensions)\n \nWhat are some techniques or skills I can use for feature selection? Are there any resources I can read to learn? Books/articles/papers/etc.\n \n Thanks in advance and I’m sorry if this has already been asked… I’m having trouble finding a post.\n    submitted by    /u/LongjumpingWinner250  \n [link]   [comments]",

But this is not why I made the switch into DS a few years ago - if anything, I was looking for a more exciting technical challenge after a couple of years in a pretty mundane SWE job.\n To those stuck in \"BI\" data science roles but keen to grow - what's your way of giving your brain cells some intellectual stimulation before your job makes you too dumb?

Basically Data Science doesn´t care why a model works as long as model predicts with a minimum of accuracy? Staticians do care why a model works and are interested in effect size, p values etc of variables in the model?\n I don´t understand why there is this distinction. If I have a better understanding of the impotance of variables in my model I will have more faith in the future predictability of my model. So explanation improves prediction in this sense.

          "description": "Hey guys. I've been applying for entry-level data scientist / senior data analyst roles for a month now and the going has been tough. I'm trying to think if there are other careers I can expand into given what I know about data science so far, to enhance my ability to find a job. Obviously data engineering is an option, but also curious about peoples' thoughts about SWE in Data jobs and how hard it would be to make the transition, and what additional knowledge would be required to transition.\n Would be great to hear from people who have made a transition, in particular.\n For some context - I studied economics in undergrad and have 4 years of experience as a data analyst, and recently finished a 2-year masters in data science degree from a Top 10 American University. And I'm getting little hits in the market, even for job titles that I have already had (senior data analyst).\n    submitted by    /u/i_am_baldilocks  \n [link]   [comments]",

Having a program that can generate images just by describing them in any style I want is cool but it's not something I think anyone really needs and it will just take jobs away from artists in an already precarious industry with excessive supply.\n Now why isn't Ai creation being focused on making the stuff most of us human need but don't enjoy doing. That's what tools are for aren't they? \n Why can't AI do a business plan, take care of taxes or manage finances, reply to boring work emails, write me a report, make a website, organize my calendar, diagnose me when I feel sick etc\n I feel like the creative fields are some of the last that need to be automated since alot of people enjoy the process of creation even more then the results and almost no one is crying out for AI to come and save art.\n In a utopia ai would be used to automate all the parts of work that we don't enjoy but are necessary so we could all focus on doing what we love.\n    submitted by    /u/Bsides9  \n [link]   [comments]",

Multiple companies and software like such have successfully integrated AI into their products because AI is definitely making work faster and sometimes even better than people in a lot of cases. So my question is, what is stopping companies from implementing AI in web design?\n Apologies if the question seems naive. I'm neither a design expert nor an AI expert. Just a student who was exploring these fields. \n So I was wondering whether AI can boost their design industry in Web development. Can't AI be used to improve landing pages or even create them? If AI text writing, AI painting and AI illustrations software are all readily available, how hard will it be to implement the same concept for web designing?\n TIA for the insight!\n    submitted by    /u/SheikhSahb  \n [link]   [comments]",
