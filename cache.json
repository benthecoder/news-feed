Can't view on GitHub like Md or ipynb. If sharing must also share a folder of figure files.\n  \nKnit to embedded html Same advantages as 1., But also addresses the issue of having to share image files. Drawback is embedded html are even larger.\n \nMd document Most lightweight, viewable on GitHub, but images are not embedded.\n \n So I guess for me the approach I will start using is to knit to embedded html + Md.

          "description": "I've had a few buddies in the community ask about something like this in the last week, and then a reader did today so I finally took the time to write it up. It's basically a generic interface to try embeddings, and it's less than a hundred lines of code. Built this so you can just authenticate and test without having to fuss with numpy, pinecone, etc.\n The only thing you do is put dictionaries with a name and text key, then search your embeddings instance. We return anything you stick in there with it too for your programming pleasure - think dates, page numbers, file names, whatever.\n You can just... Build chat bots that are pretty smart like this for next to nothing by reading in your docs or whatever. It's cheap and incredibly effective. I know next to nothing about how to preprocess data for this thing, I've tried different sizes of chunks, lines, sentences and haven't found a one size fits all solution (other than more gpt to summarize) but - just try it, it's cheap as hell and there's so much you can do. Like the rest of the current state of gpt - it just kinda works. Start with one to five sentences (or lines for code) and experiment!\n For you proper data scientists (nerds!) - you can just get the numpy array out and do regular embeddings stuff with it. If you do, I'd love to hear about it! Clustering, classification, etc are suddenly super easy, and the raw data is stored in json so you can upload it to something better when you're ready.\n I know it's small, but little abstractions make life better. Anything we can do to lower the barrier to experimentation is worth doing. Hope it helps someone!\n    submitted by    /u/morganpartee  \n [link]   [comments]",

I love the analytics parts of my job but have pretty much topped out in terms of analytic depth that they explore and am coding less and less as I progress there, so I am looking to use grad school as a way to expand my toolkit beyond SQL, learn more about ML and stats, and pivot to a more technical data science role outside of consulting.\n I have been looking at more BI-focused programs like MSBAs, masters programs in statistics and/or economics with a focus on data science, and MSDS programs. I have chatted with some friends and mentors who thought that a masters in stats would be the most interesting for me and best for my career. However, I went into undergrad with a non-STEM major and only started taking stats/data science-focused classes later in school. I have taken multiple statistics and econometrics courses, as well as an intro data science course using Python and some calc/linear algebra concepts, but have not taken anything beyond intro calc or a linear algebra class. These are requirements for most stat and data science master's programs I look at.\n So my question is, are statistics masters really looked at more favorably than MSDSes or MSBAs? Will one of those masters programs be enough to help me get a data science job with my current work experience? And if a stats program really does seem better, would it be helpful for me to enroll in calculus and linear algebra classes beforehand or does my experience seem like enough to help me stay afloat?\n    submitted by    /u/brpjumbo1  \n [link]   [comments]",

No special skills needed.\n Getting involved would be as easy as PMing me, hearing about how we’ve done things so far and then saying what you might be interested in helping with.

Where it might take you years of training to understand the intricacies of how to successfully compose music, with Adamu, it’s as simple as a couple of clicks.\n While there are a couple of automated applications on the market, they tend to be more passive. Adamu is dynamic – it allows users the chance to co-create music alongside AI and produce a playable score at the end. With Adamu, professionals and amateurs alike can create unique musical scores for a range of different instruments and across different styles. The AI training works with the user to predict the best combination of notes and rhythms, ensuring your new composition always sounds the way it should.\n The application has many potential uses – from original scores for concerts and videos to teaching music composition. You can even use Adamu to discover how different composers might have played your favorite tune!\n I already used Adamu to complete Beethoven’s unfinished 10th symphony (in one day!). What could be next?\n https://adamu.tech/\n If you have any questions, I will make sure to forward them to him but getting responses back may take some time.\n    submitted by    /u/GloWondub  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think of Susan Sontag, who called it \"aesthetic consumerism\" half a century before Instagram. In a small act of resistance, I offer The Unphotographable -- Saturdays, a lovely image in words drawn from centuries of literature: passages transcendent and transportive, depicting landscapes and experiences radiant with beauty and feeling beyond what a visual image could convey.",
