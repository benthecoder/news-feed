I'm storing some file meta data like: size, mtime, and user id in a pandas dataframe, and it's taking 20+ hours to complete. What's odd about this is if I just go through the file system and only record file paths, it only takes about 6 hours. Which I would say is pretty fair. \n I feel that my problem is a memory problem. The more data is store the slower the program gets. Im sure people in this field have to work through datasets this large or larger very frequently, and there are developed methods for doing so efficiently. \n Is there a better means to record file meta data than to just save it in a structure in memory?\n    submitted by    /u/CruderMermaid6  \n [link]   [comments]",
