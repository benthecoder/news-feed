          "description": "Comic Code is a monospaced adaptation of Comic Sans. Designed specifically for programming, which is a corner of typography that involves intensive typing that feels more akin to handwriting than typesetting, this typeface took inspirations from the friendly characteristics and low-resolution legibility of Comic Sans. It is an unapologetic admittance of the positives of the source design, and a literal manifestation of “code like nobody’s watching”. Comic Code only takes inspiration from Comic Sans and was drawn entirely from scratch, in case you are wondering.\nComments",

I work with a lot of attorneys. We do a lot direct client services, and we do a lot of public policy work. I have a technical background in biosci. When I was hired, they asked me to take care of some data stuff. Now i do a lot of data work. I taught myself python / pandas pretty well. I’ve worked with tableau. I’ve built scrapers. I’ve uncovered insights. I’ve communicated my work. I’ve helped customize a new CRM. I’ve designed new workflows. I also take care of a lot of the other tech needs of the org.\n I’m not quite sure exactly what I would call my job title at this point.

In leave-one-out validation, we repeatedly evaluate the algorithm by removing one data point from the training set, training the algorithm on the remaining data set and then testing it on the point we removed to see if the label matches or not. Repeating this for each of the data points gives us an estimate as to the percentage of erroneous predictions the algorithm makes and thus a measure of the accuracy of the algorithm for the given data. Apply your leave-one-out validation with your KNN algorithm to the dataset for Question 1 c) for values for K of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 and report the results.

Here's an example:\n Let's say the task is predicting car prices for an online marketplace, a value you'd like to present to someone about to list their car on the site. You can use your marketplace's historic sales as a training set. However, as the marketplace evolved, more features were added to the car object, and maybe some stopped being used. E.g., in the early phase of the marketplace, you had 3 features: car model, year, and color. Then maybe later on the company stopped collecting color, and instead now collect MPG and transmission type. So now you have 4 features on the newer dataset: car model, year, MPG, and transmission type. And so on and so on...did you just impute the missing values? not use features that are missing data? Split test/train to only reflect current features? Is it a constant game of cat and mouse keeping up with the fresh features?\n    submitted by    /u/foreignparent  \n [link]   [comments]",
