Relevant info about me: \n  \nHave a PhD in chemical engineering \n My thesis area was an obscure area of applied physics\n I have the only job in the 100 mile radius of me that uses my skill set \n There’s no way to expand my skill set in my current role to be more marketable \n I’ve applied to a bunch of scientist roles in my area and heard nothing, likely due to my lack of experience at all in biology/chemistry/biochemistry\n My work place is extremely toxic, and I would like to quit, but I can’t do that and feel good about it without a plan. \n It’s a miserable dead end but I’m making $130k.\n My husband makes enough money that I don’t have to work, but it’s not ideal in the long term. \n I have a strong math background but it’s never been stats focused. \n I’m good at data analysis and coding, but it’s never been my focus. \n I don’t love science any more. I want a 9 to 5 job. \n  \nI’m wondering if it’s time to make a big change. I get the idea here that you all are over answering questions like this, but I’ve searched around and I haven’t found the answer. What would my pathway be to a career in data science? Could I teach myself the skills or do I need actual formal training like a masters? I’m okay with a title like “junior data scientist” for a while. I know I would advance. I’m more just scared to make the change, unclear on what I would need to do, and I’m need of guidance. If anyone can share their path if not traditional or advice on the currrent job market, it would be appreciated. Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/PretendiFendi  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone -- new to the community here, so apologies if this should be posted somewhere else / something similar has already been answered (just lmk). \n I recently graduated in May 2022 and am currently working in finance, but I really enjoyed coding / data analysis in college (I was a stats / data science major). I'm thinking of maybe switching to the data science field in 1-2 years and was wondering what courses / bootcamps / education are necessary to land an entry-level data scientist role (ideally remote / in NYC). For context, my undergrad is prob considered a top 5 institution, but its data science program is not the strongest -- mostly focused on just R (no Python or SQL), so I would def need improvement in Python, SQL, and ML in general. \n Basically, I'm looking for advice on how to improve my Python / SQL skills (e.g., any online courses that I could do on weekends, etc.) and also wondering if a Master's is really necessary to land an entry-level data scientist role? I've seen some data scientist jobs prefer or require a Master's, but wasn't sure how beneficial a Master's would be. On the other hand, I've seen many jobs ask for 1-4 years of relevant work experience in data science, but other than my recent stats/data science major, I've mostly only done econ or finance-related internships (and am currently full-time in finance), so not sure what's the best path to get an entry-level data scientist position here (i.e. can I do it without a Master's and just study on the weekends, or would a Master's be the most helpful here?).\n Sorry for the jumble of words, and thank you in advance!! Any advice would be much appreciated :)\n    submitted by    /u/ophelia_1113  \n [link]   [comments]",

On that basis I have done some preliminary research into it although it seems a little vague (in terms of the specifics). So I thought I would ask the group to see if there is a simple answer:\n Is it possible to get tourism based statistics from google maps (or a close proxy)? I have read that it is possible to get data such as the number of reviews for a specific place, although this seems predicated on the basis that the number of reviewers is transitive to the number of visitors. Is there an alternative metric that does not rely on someone actively typing out a review (either for a town, country, or specific location)?\n    submitted by    /u/OneProfileToRuleThem  \n [link]   [comments]",

I really need your advice.\n I am working on this project and I need to predict price of logistic shipmment orders. \n I have 20+ variables like distance, origin, destination, weight and volume of the shippment. \n I used LGBM and AutoGluon (Ensemble of LGBM, XGBoost, and Catboost), they both have relatively low RMSE (300) on the validation set and the test set. But they seem to give strange prediction on unseen data.\n For example, an shippment that weighs 10000 lbs costs $1200. But when I keep other variables still and increases the weight of the shippment from 5000lbs to 12000 lbs. I saw decrease in my price predictions. This is counterinuitive. More weights should increase the price!!!\n What is causing this? Did I pick the wrong model? LGBM are not suitable for this? \n I tried nerual network. It has much higher RMSE (450) on the test set, but its prediction increased when I increased the weight of shippments.\n    submitted by    /u/MJ_adv  \n [link]   [comments]",

Given that i have been doing it for sometime, i wanted to try something new. I used to do Data Structures in my college also and found it interesting. I had following queries basically-\n 1) I don’t want to loose my hands-on knowledge on Data Science, is there a way i can start with Soft Dev without losing touch with Data Science. \n 2) Have you seen people starting SWE as fresher after like 4-5 years in other domain?\n 3) I will have to take a pay-cut if i start as a fresher in SWE, so the only way to manage both things, i.e same or better compensation and also getting experience of SWE is a kind of work profile that helps me work on SWE while also values my Data Science Experience.\n 4) Lastly, is it feasible to prepare for both domains simultaneously, for eg i leetcode for sometime to prepare for Soft dev, and simultaneously also keep working on Data Science in parallel, so that there is always a backup option while applying for Jobs. Or I should just choose one domain and work at Getting better at it.\n    submitted by    /u/raghu_1234  \n [link]   [comments]",
