          "description": "Most people agree that having a whiteboard during a meeting, or having diagrams & charts in a paper is better than not - but I don’t see a lot of discussion about what makes a great diagram / architectural sketch / etc.\nIf reading is the way to become a better writer, I assume that looking at examples of good diagrams is the way to improve how I communicate visually. So let’s share examples of great diagrams about CS, software, hardware, etc and why we think they’re great.\nAlternatively, if there’s a site or book that already has a collection focused on visual explanations of computing concepts that we should know about please share that.\nI think e.g. Tufte’s books are probably required reading along these lines, but they are much more general purpose and I’m curious about great examples in computing.",

I applied for more than 300 and this past week I decided to start a program that will apply for jobs for me at any entry level position in DS or data engineering, even software engineering. \n I have had countless interviews getting to 2nd to last interview process at times, yet it hits hard when getting rejected. About 70% of what I hear is \"we want someone with my experience and with you not fitting the 2 or 3 years we are looking for this entry position, it doesn't quite cut it.\"\n I have 1 year before being let go and job changed to less technical, more consulting. (corporate decision also i didnt wabt to be in consulting) \n I just don't know what more I can do. I'm even debating on going to do my masters. Only thing that sucks is my bills. But I'm to a point of I rather be in bed than code anymore. \n It seems that the job market has changed drastically where entry position is 2+ years of experience rather than just graduating and getting it. My tech skills are there for entry, yet experience isn't. Been told by a great manager that \"I still have raw skills and I need to find a place where they will take the time and have you grow withing the company.\"\n    submitted by    /u/Enough_Classroom_903  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m staying within my company, so I’m pretty familiar with the business and the domain. Trying to catch up on recent developments in the space, and haven’t looked into forecasting since my Masters a few years ago, so I’m pretty rusty. \n I’m currently making my way through Hyndman’s Forecasting: Principles and Practice as a review, then I’m planning to catch up on Prophet and NeuralProphet (my company is currently employing Prophet models in Python AFAIK). Also considering looking into some Kaggle forecasting competition notebooks just to see what that community has been employing. \n Any recommendations on papers, SubReddits, podcasts, packages (R or Python) etc. that have recently pushed the needle on what’s possible, or have material on more modern best practices in the field? Or any opinions on my learning plan for now? \n My intuition on the methodological requirements is that interpretability is pretty important since the models tend to be looked at with a pretty high degree of scrutiny, but regardless I’m open to any and all suggestions!\n    submitted by    /u/MadLadPatty  \n [link]   [comments]",

Are there any other fields you would look into if you could do it all over again?\n How much does money motivate you to stay in data science/ML?\n What regrets or advice do you have when looking back on your decisions?\n  \nAs a senior in college, I have regretting not going the data science/ML route. But I was recently told that its not too late for me, and that a statistics and marketing background isn't the worst for ML jobs.\n I figure its always best to talk to the people who have been through the gauntlet ahead of me, so any and all insights as appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Lintaar  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am early in my grad program (MS Data Analytics), and I just finished my first week of my part-time, fully remote work, data science internship at a large company. The company is much larger than my previous job, which was a part-time bookkeeping at a small church. And I feel kind of lost and anxious. I wasn't able to ask as many questions as I wanted to this first week. It looks like everyone else is pretty busy, as they immediately jump off the call when the scheduled end time hits. Today I attended a meeting with my direct manager and two other team members (one of whom was assigned to me as my mentor of sorts) to discuss requirements for a project they want me to work on, and it was all over the place. I wasn't able to follow any of it aside from the first few minutes, and the rest of the meeting was the two other team members and my direct manager talking about something that happened a year ago. \n I have been reassured by my direct manager that I'm basically going to be useless for the first few weeks, because their IT is notoriously slow and they have yet to install everything on my work computer I need. But it's doing little for my nerves. I do try to keep myself busy. I do make sure I tried a couple of things before I ask questions; I know these people are busy. I haven't even finished looking through everything they sent me yet. I've never received so many emails in my entire life continuously.

With other libraries like Pandas I can write new code without a reference, or look at readthedocs for quick reference. But with Sklearn I'm googling, copy pasting code, changing it, getting errors and trying random shit until the errors stop. I do this a lot without improving my understanding.\n Obviously I'm missing core knowledge but I don't know what it's called to even look for it. If I look something up in Sklearn readthedocs I don't know if I should something.somethingelse() Or I should something(somethingelse) Or I should mything=something() mything(somethingelse)\n Then there's words like estimator, object, method, constructor, class, pipeline, transformer. I look them up in the glossary, but I am no closer to grasping their specialness. I know a Pipeline when I see it, but despite reading tutorial after tutorial on Pipelines I cannot find an answer to what makes a Pipeline a different beast from a bunch of functions. For that matter, a lot of this stuff sounds like functions but...aren't? Does this have something to do with the functional versus object oriented programming debate? My limited understanding of this debate is that functional programming is logical and object oriented makes me disoriented.\n Is there a book everyone read that I didn't hear about??? I want to be able to look at readthedocs and have that convey to my brain what to type in Python, without resorting to monkey business.
