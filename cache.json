I did the first part in 2012 and it definitely stands the test of time, but I'm not sure about the rest of the course.\n Here is the course:\n https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ydatabases-databases\n More generally, if people have recommendations for resources to study intermediate/advanced topics in data engineering and data modeling, that would be very helpful.\n    submitted by    /u/i_am_baldilocks  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Currently in grad schools for data science and it's cool and all, but there's so much bs to deal with.\n Like, for a final project, we had to have the professors approve our proposal. It was written well, but he just kept rejecting them for dumb reasons and because he said \"the data isn't rich enough\". Like bruh, that's for me to deal with and you to grade later on, we'll figure it out, I don't need you to hold my hand. Like, I get he wants us to do a good job, but at some point he just has to let us figure it out. Then he approved it two days before the final project was due. Like wtf.\n And then on top of that, the teams, Jesus christ. You would think people in grad school would know how to work in a team.\n We'll be assigned a project due in like 4 weeks. And for the first two weeks (or sometimes more) , no one does anything. So then, I have to speak up and get the ball rolling. But even then, people who know HOW to do tasks won't do them until they are specifically told what to do. Literally, people won't do or say anything until someone else comes and plans it out for them, I've pushed the limit before to see how long people will wait and it's scary how long they will until someone speaks up. \n So I have to plan everything out for everyone and delegate tasks and then put it all together all while the professor is asking for updates, and of course I have to speak to him because no one else wants to. Like, my guy, let my team do their shit and we'll get it to you. And it's me having to do that like 99% of the time.\n But then it feels isolating because while everyone does their one task, it feels like I'm juggling a million things just to get a final project out so we don't all fail. \n God, it's so frustrating.

With 2 YOE (SQL, Stats in R) and a MSc degree I barely qualify to most job ads, even the junior positions.\n I've been doing an Udemy course on ML deployment, but of course this won't compare to having experience in a company, although still covers a lot of topics from modular code to deploying in AWS, CI/CD, Docker, etc.\n I'm wondering if a better use of my time is to focus more on the analytics side (Power BI, ETLs, Excel, etc) than on ML engineering. I've been looking at DA job ads but most of them ask for advanced Excel, being able to write ETLs, etc, so it looks like it's a whole other area that I would need to learn.\n Should I keep on doing the production course or it doesn't have much value if I'm not already in a company trying to implement those things? Or maybe finish that first and then learn at least ETLs? Big data technologies?\n This field is so vast that is hard to have a sense of direction on where to focus my time. Plus you need the time to keep knowledge fresh for any interviews that come about.\n Thank you for your advice :)\n    submitted by    /u/Trucomallica  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, \n I'm new here and I just want to rant and rave a little! \n I studied statistics with a minor in programming in college. Afterward, started to work as an analytics campaign manager in a healthcare company. My job covered making sure the architecture was working correctly to using basic algorithms like K-means, and logistic regression to create campaigns to increase cx and sales. My job was very satisfactory in a way as I could see cancer patients struggling less or people would find they had cancer in the early stages and could get treatment before it was late. \n ​\n Due to financial reasons, I decided to become a data scientist, did a master and found a job in Western Europe. I'm working at a consulting company where I just do the analytics and prepare presentations but all the interesting stuff like creating the solution, and presenting it to the client belongs to other people. I'm just doing my 'numbers magic' - whatever they asked me to do- and they do all the fun stuff. The worst part is whatever I do is just for companies to save money, it doesn't affect people in any way. \n ​\n I can't go back to my old work because I have to stay in Europe to make the money and send it to my parents. And my visa allows me just to do technical jobs, nothing like marketing, sales etc... \n ​\n I feel stuck but don't know what to do. I'm not asking for advice or anything, I just wanted to share, to relax a little.\n    submitted by    /u/Good_Old_Days_92  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, thanks in advance for your advice.\n I'm trying to determine whether certain product feature improvements increased the number of monthly active users (active is defined as whether the user made a purchase in the last 28 days). We have the ability to A/B test but I'm getting stuck because this MAU metric is a moving window metric. If we run the experiment for exactly 28 days then I think calculating the impact to MAU is easy. But most of the time our experiments run for more or less days than 28 days. Below are a few scenarios to illustrate my point.\n Note: All scenarios are A/B tests where we split our user base into equal treatment and control groups. So far, I've been calculating \"MAU Rate\", which is the proportion of users who placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment.\n  \nScenario 1: Run experiment for exactly 28 days. At the end of 28 days, simply compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order.\n Scenario 2: Run experiment for less than 28 days, say 14 days. At the end of the experiment, compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment. The issue is that this will include days from before the experiment started. If I use only the days during the experiment, then I'm not really measuring MAU since MAU is 28 days and the experiment ran for only 14 days.\n Scenario 3: Run experiment for more than 28 days, say 35 days. At the end of the experiment, compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment. The issue is that this will exclude data from the first 7 days of the experiment. If I use all the days during the experiment, then I'm not really measuring MAU since MAU is 28 days and the experiment ran for 35 days.\n  \nDoes anyone have any advice on how to measure impact to MAU through experimentation? Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/productanalyst9  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has the potential to transform the way we diagnose and treat various health conditions. From X-rays to MRI scans, these techniques allow doctors to see inside the human body and identify problems that might not be visible to the naked eye. However, the adoption of AI in the medical field is not without challenges.\n A recent study has explored the determinants for the adoption of AI-powered decision-making support systems in the medical imaging workflow. The study used data from clinicians who participated in an international evaluation of healthcare practitioners and applied confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling to understand the factors that influence the adoption and usage of AI in medical imaging.\n The results of the study showed that understanding the role of security, risk, and trust is crucial for the intended usage of AI in the medical imaging workflow. These findings provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners looking to understand the adoption and acceptance of AI in the medical field.\n As AI continues to make advances in the field of medical imaging, it is important to consider the role of these factors in the adoption and acceptance of AI by healthcare practitioners. By understanding and addressing these challenges, we can ensure that the adoption of AI in medical imaging is seamless and effective.\n In your opinion, what are the biggest challenges to the widespread adoption of AI in the medical imaging workflow?\n    submitted by    /u/FMCalisto  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Apple quietly launched a catalogue of books narrated by AI in a move that may mark the beginning of the end for human narrators. The strategy marks an attempt to upend the lucrative and fast-growing audiobook market - but it also promises to intensify scrutiny over allegations of Apple's anti-competitive behaviour.\n Apple's development of AI to narrate books could represent a significant shift in how major technology companies see the future of audiobooks.\n  \nIn recent months, Apple approached independent publishers as potential partners, including some in the Canadian market, but not all agreed to participate\n Apple would shoulder the costs of production and writers would receive royalties from sales.\n  \nThe Future\n  \nWhile there is potential for backlash by professional voice actors, authors themselves are increasingly being asked to narrate their own books\n There is a financial incentive for the writers, both in the upfront payments and the expanded availability of their work\n But producing an audiobook with a human voice can take weeks and can cost publishers thousands of dollars\n  \nApple and Amazon\n  \nFor years, Apple has sold books and audiobooks through its Books app\n Apple was rumored to be interested in developing its own audiobook service and shifting from a reseller to a producer\n The move represents a direct shot at rival Amazon, with Apple listing what it said were the benefits of its own system compared to Kindle's Direct Publishing\n Lawmakers in Europe and the United States have put in place increasing scrutiny of the company in the wake of allegations that Apple limits competition\n  \n​\n This is from the AI With Vibes Newsletter, read the full issue here:\n https://aiwithvibes.beehiiv.com/p/new-world-goodbye-homework-elon-loves-ai-essays\n    submitted by    /u/Mk_Makanaki  \n [link]   [comments]",

This doesn't just include studying but also in a work environment. \n I've been looking into how to approach and what datasets I can use to train it but I'm honestly going in blind. I'm considering using Python and Tensorflow. Is it realistic for me to be able to do something like this in 1-3 months?\n I was initially planning on using the Open AI API but it's way to costly and honestly I already wrote the code for it generally and don't feel like I'll improve much as a programmer if I continue by using the API. I'm considering pivoting as a programmer anyways and figured I might as well tackle this head on while using it for my business.\n    submitted by    /u/learningmoreandmore  \n [link]   [comments]",
