          "description": "rbperf is a Ruby profiler I’ve been working on that aims to incur low overhead, can be run against processes without having to modify or restart them and produces on-CPU profiles rather than accounting for “wall” time.\nIt also has some basic tracing functionality that I am planning to extend. One of the features I want to add before the end of the year is allocation tracing. It can now trace system calls, so we can see exactly which Ruby code called a particular system call!\nThe BPF stack walker is written in C and compiled to BPF bytecode using clang, and the userspace bits are written in Rust, which has been a pleasure to use so far and I believe it’s a good fit for this project. It’s been my first “real” project in this language which has been a great learning experience.\nI’m planning to write some posts on how rbperf works, why it’s been designed this way, and the many learnings along the way thus far :)\nWould love to hear any feedback or ideas. I am still quite new to Rust, and I am sure that things can be improved a lot! Thanks!!\nComments",

          "description": "Workarounds to computer access in healthcare are sufficiently common that they often go unnoticed. Clinicians focus on patient care, not cybersecurity. We argue and demonstrate that understanding workarounds to healthcare workers’ computer access requires not only analyses of computer rules, but also interviews and observations with clinicians. In addition, we illustrate the value of shadowing clinicians and conducing focus groups to understand their motivations and tradeoffs for circumvention. Ethnographic investigation of the medical workplace emerges as a critical method of research because in the inevitable conflict between even well-intended people versus the machines, it’s the people who are the more creative, flexible, and motivated. We conducted interviews and observations with hundreds of medical workers and with 19 cybersecurity experts, CIOs, CMIOs, CTO, and IT workers to obtain their perceptions of computer security. We also shadowed clinicians as they worked. We present dozens of ways workers ingeniously circumvent security rules. The clinicians we studied were not “black hat” hackers, but just professionals seeking to accomplish their work despite the security technologies and regulations.\nComments",

          "description": "A friend of mine works for an educational non-profit with a mission to provide kids extra education outside their classrooms. She asked me for advice on a project she has but I'm stumped too.\n The company provides both digital and physical exercise pages or articles for kids. They launched a new solution last year that assigns this educational content to kids and allows them to either: a) print it out and complete it or b) complete it virtually on a digital dashboard.\n ​\n My friend's goal: Highlight utilization of the assigned content in a data dashboard to show that \"Hey!! The stuff we give kids actually gets used!\"\n My friend's scenario: While she can track digital content to assess if it has been viewed and completed, they don't have a way to track printed content. She can see if something is printed but obviously doesn't know if the printout was thrown away or even completed. \n My friend's dilemma: What is the best way to show overall utilization? I recommended that she counts printed content as being \"done\" but she told me that was not enough. I then recommended that she separate digital from printed content and hone in on digital. She was more on board with this idea but the only caveat is that a majority of their content gets printed.\n ​\n We're both new to the data field, so are there any approaches or questions we may be missing?\n    submitted by    /u/mmaefrem  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m debating whether or not to add an applied stats minor to my curriculum, which evens out to four classes a quarter till graduation. The necessary classes will be on sampling surveys and biostatistics. The drawback is that this will really take a toll on me since I do 3 hour round trip commutes to get to school and I work part-time as well. I’d like to know if I can learn these applied skills on my own time via projects and certifications but I feel having an applied stats minor may look better on a resume. But I’d like to leave it up to the more knowledgeable people in this sub: is it worth the perseverance to get the minor or should I devote any extra time I have to polishing my skills in programming and projects?

However, after a shift of interest, I will be dropping my physics major. I decided to study data science for a year abroad and realized that data science is a career path I want to pursue. I studied introductions to machine learning, data mining, regression, data structures... all using R. Prior to my change in interest, my goal was to pursue a PhD in physics at a top university but now I want to pursue a PhD in data science. I currently am a 6th year student graduating next semester. I currently have a plethora of mathematics and physics courses underneath my belt. I also happen to have co-authored a physics paper in Materials Science and have a decent amount of research experience. My particular areas of research interests (physics and financial engineering) just so happens to be offered at Ivy league schools. In my opinion, I think it is a bit impractical to assume I have a fighting chance at getting offered a PhD position at these universities (Cornell, Columbia, Yale, Stanford, etc...). I do not have a ton of experience in Data Science. Would it be more practical to pursue a masters and obtain more work / research experience before considering a PhD position? I guess an alternative question is: how would I be able to make myself sufficiently competitive to pursue a good Data Science masters / PhD? There are tons of Data Science graduate programs and I'm having some trouble finding applicable ones for me considering graduate application deadlines are around the corner.\n    submitted by    /u/Ronanwar1  \n [link]   [comments]",

But for matrices, how can I get a \"2D\" feature space?

However, just taking the norm only gives me 1 \"axis\" so I don't know how I'd plot / cluster that (I suppose you could cluster on just 1 axis...). \n My other main concern is that in taking the norm of the matrix, I lose a lot of information. It isn't clear to me that the norm of the matrix really captures anything/enough about the actual values of the hyperparameters, but rather only looks at their variance or generally their fuzzy shape.\n Does anyone know how to cluster matrices and have any advice for how to proceed?\n    submitted by    /u/Amun-Aion  \n [link]   [comments]",

Should I maybe find a more specific problem and work on that? Another question is, would this topic also be useful in finding a job later on? Please excuse the questions if they seem stupid but I’m a beginner here and looking for opinions and maybe inspiration. Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/UnwiseChaos  \n [link]   [comments]",

I see it like the 2d object recognition in RCNN or SDD. They put bounding boxes around multiple objects in an image. That’s what I want, underline/tag substrings and identify their categories. I also think my problem is analogous to 1d data like ECG data with the pqrst parts of the heart beat. Many of the ECG algorithms talk about identifying the unusual heartbeat but I haven’t found examples of putting boxes around the sub segment parts of the heartbeat (pqrst parts). \n Anyone have any tips or direction to suggest on how I can change my conv1d CNN into a conv1d RCNN or SDD.
