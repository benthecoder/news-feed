          "description": "Hey HN! About a year ago i stumbled upon the world of swords, knives, and EDC gear. A weirdly addicting (and expensive) hobby to have.\nBack then i noticed something, it was quite tedious to easily sift and search through knives based on length, steel, brand, and what not to find the knife for me. There were some great youtube channels that helped me pick out what i wanted however i had to sit through multiple 30 minute videos just to review 10-15 knives or so each.\nRecently i've been having a little trouble sleeping so i decided to pickup a new passion project to work on late at night, here's KnifeGeek!\nit's a completely free website where you can search, filter, and sift through an extensive knife database (over 60K+ knives) and add them to your collection or wishlist. You do need to sign in to add stuff to your wishlist or collection and after a bunch of advanced searches.\nPlease check it out and let me know if you think anything is missing! I'll try to flesh it out more on a daily basis if people find it cool or useful.\nPlanning to add in price comparison functionality and more data per knife in the next week.\nPS: Images are a little shoddy, working on that.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34604281\nPoints: 16\n# Comments: 13",

          "description": "Hi Everyone,\nTunnlTo is a tool for controlling which Windows applications, processes, and IP addresses can use a WireGuard VPN tunnel. Here are some examples of how it could be used:\n- Route only FireFox through a privacy VPN\n- Route Slack and Microsoft Office through a work VPN\n- Route a game through a gaming VPN\n- Stop a game from routing through a privacy VPN\n- Stop a browser from routing through a work VPN\n- Route a specific IP address range through a privacy VPN\n- Route all traffic through a privacy VPN except a specific IP address range\nI have been collaborating on this project with the creator of WireSock - Vadim Smirnov.\n\"WireSock VPN Client is a lightweight command line WireGuard VPN client for Windows that has advanced features not available in the official WireGuard for Windows such as selective application tunneling and disallowed IP addresses.\nWireSock VPN Client combines the power of Windows Packet Filter and BoringTun (user space WireGuard implementation in Rust) to provide exceptional performance, security and scalability.\"\nThe TunnlTo app is built with Tauri and I've used boring old HTML, CSS (bootstrap) and JavaScript as I had major JS framework fatigue. I have previously built a production app with Electron and Vue. Tauri appealed to me for its use of Rust and its small installation sizes. I tried Tauri pre version 1.0 and had a bit of trouble but this time around its been a positive experience. The docs and the Discord community have come a long way.\nI would appreciate any feedback about the project so I can get an idea of what direction to take it in next. Vadim will be around a little later if anyone is curious about the WireGuard implementation and wants to know more.\nThanks for reading!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34602444\nPoints: 15\n# Comments: 0",

We published the source code for everyone to use, so I certainly did not expect to lose access to it just because someone at my previous company has been doing spring cleaning at GitHub! I had a 100% legal fork of the project, and now it's gone... why?\nTurns out I don't even have a local copy of it anymore, so this actually caused me data loss. I'm fine with losing access to this particular codebase, I'm not using HN as customer support to regain access.

          "description": "Last December, Heroku nuked the database on one of my active projects.  I was travelling at the end of the year and did not catch wind of this until I returned and saw messages about an issue with the app.  Sure enough, I checked and noticed that the database was gone and detached on December 9th.\nBefore the hate comes out, yes I know Heroku deprecated free tiers.  However, I did not understand this would affect my projects on paid dynos.  The real issue here is that I never received a single email or notice of any kind to my email about this.  From researching, it appears most people received SEVERAL notices about this.  I did not think there was an issue with my setup because I received zero communication.\nUpon reaching out, Heroku has told me that they cannot recover the database.  They also admitted that there was \"an issue\" sending out notifications to me, and confirmed that none were sent.\nSo I guess just a warning to all - your database might be nuked at any time.  I learned my lesson about not doing an offsite backup regularly.  I guess the bigger lesson though is that Heroku should really be a last resort option for projects these days.

          "description": "I'm trying to describe mathematically a strain pattern of a structure (civil engineering) that I analyzed with FEM. I extracted a 'line' of mesh nodes from the fem analysis and found the constants for the approximation function f(x) using lmfit (least squares) with python. I have 4 constants (a,b,d,f) and want to link those constants to geometrical properties of the structure. I already determined the value for 'b' and know that 'a' and 'd' are somewhat associated with one geometrical dimension. I have determined the geometrical parameters that influence on the strain and want to determine the value for the f(x) constants based on this geometrical dimensions. I have 35 different fem simulations, varying the geometrical dimensions of the structure.\n The question for you guys is: is there a software where I can input the function (and its determined constants values obtained with the lest squares approximation) and the geometrical parameters from the structure and get some correlation? (like the 'a' constant from f(x) is 2/54* (geometrical dimension) ). Or a way that I can do it with python, perhaps. \n ​\n here is the f(x) and the 'b' value. \n the 'b' value on the geometry. I have the g' value that I want to correlate with 'a' and 'd', and some other geometry dimensions (thickness, for example)\n ​\n  This is one of my functions, and its approximation with the values of the constants (for the positive and negative values of z, as the function is not symmetrical).\n ​\n the report that I get from the lmfit analysis.\n    submitted by    /u/WoOfnt  \n [link]   [comments]",

Obviously, real world projects are going to be more desirable, but in some cases this isn’t possible. Or at least, in my case. I wasn’t ever able to take home artifacts (dashboards, slides, notebooks, etc.) from my previous work, as it was sensitive data. The only other projects I have are just college ones, which were less impressive Kaggle problems. My current role is data scientist by title but our ML projects just keep getting delayed for other things, so no work there. \n So, that leaves me to building out a portfolio of personal projects.\n What do people in the space want to see?\n What’s interesting to me personally, is being able to look back at my college problems and examine why my approach was incorrect using my real-world knowledge. So a good project might be using the same dataset and methods, with a write-up of how to improve it.\n Otherwise, I’d just want to do some projects that seem fun to me.\n So hiring managers, or senior roles, what are the best projects that you’ve seen someone talk about in an interview?\n    submitted by    /u/tigerclaw468  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello humans! A project is about to start (https://github.com/neuralshare) which will allow any device, even low-cpu, to use and interact with AI models that they could not use since they require so many hardware resources. The project is called NeuralShare and will use the Stellar network to achieve its goal, as you can read on the README on Github at the link on this post. More specifically, it will use the Futurenet network and to achieve its purpose it will use the NEUR token, also on Futurenet, which was already created a little while ago and has no real value, has no speculative objective but only has one purpose, namely that of the project. We plan to distribute this token as an airdrop, totally free of course, and anyone who has this token will be able to use and interact with GPT-3 or other AI models for free simply by sending a NEUR transaction with a text memo attached containing the prompt. In return you will receive back a transaction with a text memo containing the response. However, this will only be possible when there are enough nodes (go to github to understand why),the precise number of nodes that must be active before the response can be received is still to be defined . For more details and updates you can add yourself to Discord, find the links on the README file on GitHub, as well as more details on the functioning of this method which will also allow you to use GPT-3 for free and without an api-key\n    submitted by    /u/0ut0flin3  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also studied Computer Science for 4 years but never graduated (that's a whole other sobstory -- won't bore anyone with that)\n I've been considering the direction I want to go for the next leg of my career and I feel like AI/ML is the logical next step.\n I've started building a portfolio of my AI/ML projects and I'd like to pick up a cert or two to compliment them. My ultimate goal is solutions architecture, but I love the engineering side of things and expect to start there.\n What I want to know is what certifications everyone would recommend -- I've been eyeing the IBM-sponsored certificate tracks on Coursera but I've seen a few others and they all have their merits.
