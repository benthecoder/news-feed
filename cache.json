          "description": "I'm currently working at a trading desk in an asset manager firm. The pay is good but I grew to learn that the finance / macroeconomics side of my job is not what drives me the most. I realized what I enjoy the most is the technical / coding / data analysis or wrangling side of my job. The thing is I don't really know what habilities should I develop to land a decent paying job as data analyst or data engineer.\n Most of the tasks at my current job involves building automated reports and managing a database with information on what has been traded by the portfolio managers, performing risk analysis and calculating P&L of trades.\n The system that I developed is based on R, Rmarkdown (for reports) and is feeded from an SQL database that I also manage. I also have some fluency on python but but I have less experience on it.\n I also manage a systematic portfolio based on some regressions in order to recognize trends. But it's probably going to be taken from me, so I'll loose this fun project.\n My background is on electrical engineering (bachelor) in one of the best universities at my country although I was not a great student...\n So in my view I have something to show in order to persue a career in this field but I lack knowledge in the specific technologies more relevant than just basic coding and querying / updating / maintaining a database.\n I'm kinda lost and don't know where to start. Is Data Engineering too far of a jump? I feel like I would be prepared for a data analytics job but it seems not to be that well paying.\n What kind of skills do I need to develop for those jobs?\n Also, I'm 27 and turning 28 in March. Am I too old for this transition? Should I just stick with finance? My fear with sticking with it is that i won't have the passion to keep studying and progressing on the career.\n    submitted by    /u/finnobserver  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I paused my Bachelor's degree in Marketing almost a year ago to pursue an education in a technology field. I chose Data Science and I loved it!\n However, in my country, no university (that I could pay, at least) would offer a data centered course, so I decided to enroll in a Data Science course provided by a major technology school over here. It's not an university, but the school is great! It's recognized by not only big companies in the market, but even by the government itself as a professionalizing school. \n I'm going to graduate on my data science course by July this year and I was told by my teachers that starting to look for jobs would be a good idea, and so I did. \n I could look for jobs in my home country (many great opportunities around) but what I actually want is an international opportunity (better payment, even more opportunities in major companies, maybe a chance to live abroad for a few years, among other reasons). However, every job post I've seen so far requires you a Bachelor's degree in at least a related area.\n If I show them I have a degree (Not a bachelor's degree level one, but still a degree issued by an actual educational institution) and show them a good portfolio, show them I have the skills, etc, would I still have hiring chances? \n I know a good amount of people who work in tech and have no Bachelor's degree and are not even enrolled to get one. I was under the impression that the Data market wouldn't be different, that it is in so much need for professionals that maybe companies wouldn't be so picky when they found a professional with the skills set and work ethics they're looking for, but I wanted to hear from international professionals.\n    submitted by    /u/Traditional-Reach818  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll be answering some technical questions and do some live coding. \n I asked the interviewer if he could go into detail about what will be asked and he said they will explore my \"knowledge to industrialize one data product in Python\".\n I know I'm new to this, but I've never heard about this concept. At first, I thought he could mean something to do with deployment, but it's for a developer position. I believe this is not an industry term and maybe he meant something else that I'm not getting.\n Does anyone know exactly what this means? I would also appreciate if some of you could share some tips for the interview.\n Thank you all in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/_r_u_i_  \n [link]   [comments]",

As I am 30 now, I am worried what my career trajectory is going to be. I started as a Business analyst then learnt some python and moved to data engineering.\n Things I like/dislike about data engineering - 1) just do you task, build pipelines and it is systematic. 2) absolutely hate oncalls - I work weekends, have to get up at night regularly to fix bugs every 4 weeks. It is tiring and not sure how it will affect me when I have a family life.\n I started as a business analyst and struggled to make meaningful stakeholder relationships. I a introverted, but I feel that I did not put much effort Into people skills. Because of that , I moved to data engineering. I am thinking of three options \n 1) move into data engineering platforms teams like Kafka, spark and become more technical. This role will have oncalls. 2) move into proper software engineering - more interesting but again oncall. 3) move into mobile engineering - lesser oncall load, but may get pigeonholed into iOS development. 4) move into data science - more interesting, but absolutely need top people skills, extroverted nature. But I like the role. No oncall. 5) move into data engineering management - no oncall, but again need people skills. If I am going to try this, would data science be rather better?\n Can I actually learn people skills and succeed in data science. I feel it best role in tech with no oncall. Can i succeed if it is not in my nature to get along with people easily? I can learn the tech part of data science, just worried about people skills.

However, my current role uses time-series and probabilistic programming techniques so my ML skills (NLP, computer vision, classification, etc) are limited to my masters coursework. I’m also more of a user and maintainer of the models at work rather than someone who builds them. I enjoy both the ‘building’ and ‘analyzing’ part of my job.\n The dilemma I’m finding is that I don’t seem to have the domain knowledge and real-world ML experience to jump into a different domain. For example, many of these role would say ‘previous fraud detection (plug in anything here) experience required’. I just turned 30 and live in one of the highest COL regions. I’m targeting senior ds roles with a base pay of $175k and up. Anything less than that isn’t worth it for me financially.\n I prefer the tech industry but am really open to anything.

          "description": "One claim I hear a lot in AI circles is that in the future AI will replace a lot of bullshit jobs, which will free up time for humans to focus on what matters. No more transcribing emails for a living. New, meaningful jobs will be created instead. In other words, the hope is that in 10 years more people will be psychologically happy with their jobs than today. \n I'm growing wary of the opposite risk. \n If we consider \"bullshit\" the part of a job that can be automated away, then sometimes the bullshit part of a job is what makes it pleasurable and fulfilling (provided it is not the only thing). As an artist you may draw pleasure in doing coloring after a pencil sketch. As an engineer, you may like a day without planning or meetings where you can focus on programming a small piece of code. As a blog post writer you may enjoy, well, writing. \n AI are quickly becoming able to replace all these tasks, and to stay competitive people will increasingly be required to offload parts of their jobs to them. I can see a future where jobs in any field start looking the same - the person is in charge of having higher knowledge about the problem, planning tasks for AI, be able to evaluate AI output, and assemble final product. This is certainly not a bullshit job, but I also think that for many people this is not going to be a fulfilling job.\n    submitted by    /u/R_y_n_o  \n [link]   [comments]",

They just do the same stuff, filling the world with more of the same uselessness than before.\n It's sounds arrogant and cheesy but I just hoped that because so many cool things are now doable for a lot more people that a lot more people would do cool things.\n Instead we get just the same stuff but more of it.\n    submitted by    /u/I_am_unique6435  \n [link]   [comments]",
