          "description": "Comic Code is a monospaced adaptation of Comic Sans. Designed specifically for programming, which is a corner of typography that involves intensive typing that feels more akin to handwriting than typesetting, this typeface took inspirations from the friendly characteristics and low-resolution legibility of Comic Sans. It is an unapologetic admittance of the positives of the source design, and a literal manifestation of “code like nobody’s watching”. Comic Code only takes inspiration from Comic Sans and was drawn entirely from scratch, in case you are wondering.\nComments",

It will run from 8-11 of November, but pre-registration is required for individuals or teams up to 3.\n The competition differs from the typical Kaggle / DrivenData competitions because it focuses on the use of Privacy Enhancing Technologies to access and learn from the data. Taking part, you will interact with secure enclaves, differential privacy and synthetic data and become familiar with some of the leading privacy data science libraries like OpenDP (Harvard), SmartNoise (Microsoft) and DiffPrivLib (IBM Research). \n There are also going to be a number of venues around the world where you can join in in-person and meet like-minded data scientists. The first location announcement was Harvard's John A. Paulson School Of Engineering And Applied Sciences for those in the Greater Boston Area. \n There will also be webinars and Q&A ahead of time with the lead developers of each of the prominent frameworks. \n For more information and registration: https://petlab.officialstatistics.org/ \n If you would like to host an in-person location at a university or public space, reach out to [mira@oblivious.ai](mailto:mira@oblivious.ai), and there is support to help you run it successfully.\n    submitted by    /u/oblivious-devs  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of the time I do descriptive analyses with my team on tabular data with a goal to find where models can be useful. I also worked with scrapers, models and modeling pipelines a little bit. My boss told my team that we have budget for self development, so he encouraged us to use this funding for something useful for us, so I am looking for any relevant courses. I checked courses on coursera and they seem to be more entry level. I already had MLops course from coursera which I liked since it covered a lot of things we could possibly apply in the future. Tbh I have a feeling that I can get more knowledge from reading articles and relevant books and doing small projects, but funding has to be used, so. Do you have any interesting recommendations? Now I am considering to take something from Andrew Ng classic, since we don't have a need to use any neural nets on tabular data and I start forgetting things. I also have a feeling that I don't know statistics as well as I supposed to, but I am not sure there are any online courses which cover more than the average course in my uni.

          "description": "Where have people been and how was it? I'd like to stay within Europe, due to financial constraints.\n I have a strong interest in topics across the field (so as well as ML, things like Multi-Agent Systems(!), Ethics, Neural Networks, evolutionary/bio-computing) and would like something that isn't mainly ML. I'm thinking of doing a Master's at King's in London since the course seems well-rounded, but I've talked to someone who did the course and they feel that half the courses are lazily taught and lack depth (lectures that barely cover a topic, no practicals, tutorials without many questions, teaching only narrow parts of a field).\n I'm aware UvA is popular, but it's a two year course. Leuven's on my shortlist in particular (the modules look great: link) but I've since found someone on here complaining about more or less the same thing as KCL - many lazily taught courses, no practicals, etc. so now I'm not sure..\n I'm aware no course is going to be perfect and that you get out what you put in, but it'd be nice if the courses were somewhat detailed.

          "description": "Before we talk about replacement, let us try to understand the real value of a good programmer. A good programmer’s value is not merely knowing \"how to code.\" Programmers bring value by understanding \"what to code.\"\n Simply put, they need to understand the business value of each requirement to be built and decide and prioritize their development based on the criticality. In a nutshell, they have fully functional \"thinking\" human brains.\n And the AI we see today is data-based. Yes, it can do things like categorizing images on Google, reading license plates, powering the routines of Alexa and Siri, and even using highly sophisticated methods of classifying data and recognizing patterns.\n But it cannot think like a human brain. For AI systems to be capable of 'thinking,' they need to be continually trained and fed with giant data banks covering every possible human scenario. This is not 100% possible.\n That is why AI can write code but can't ensure that it has written the correct code. It cannot understand the business value of features. It cannot refactor an old, buggy code and cannot decide whether to remove a piece of code or not.\n So, the future of software development and AI is collaboration and integration. AI will help programmers redefine programming by taking over tedious, repetitive tasks so that programmers can focus on building something great.\n Programmers can also pair with AI to write better software and reduce development lifecycle times. And far from replacing programmers, AI is becoming ready to reimagine a programmer’s workload through integration and enhanced efficiency.\n Here are five benefits of using AI in software development:\n  \nAI can validate project requirements\n Automatic debugging\n Automatic testing\n AI can make programmers more efficient\n AI will change software development\n  \nRead more...\n https://turbofuture.com/computers/5-Benefits-of-Using-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Software-Development\n    submitted by    /u/IcyCartoonist1955  \n [link]   [comments]",

It performs various graph transformations and optimizes execution time with new C++ kernel templates for the GPU target, while maintaining a minimal dependency on external libraries CUDA/ROCm.\n https://github.com/facebookincubator/AITemplate\n This is a really promising project intended to be an alternative to TensorRT and other inference tools. As maintainers of the opensource nebullvm inference accelerator, I am very eager to see the performance of AIT compared to other inference tools. We are working on integrating AIT in nebullvm so that users can test AIT, TensorRT, ONNX Runtime and other state-of-the-art inference optimizers to see which one provides the best performance for your model and hardware.\n Kudos Meta!\n    submitted by    /u/galaxy_dweller  \n [link]   [comments]",
