          "description": "Nango (https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango) provides pre-built OAuth flows, secure token storage and automatic refreshes for 40+ APIs and counting.\nWhy we built Nango:\nWe built Nango to solve the pain of accessing OAuth APIs. Despite OAuth being a standard protocol in theory, it remains a major burden to implement it, even with the help of a library. You still need to add endpoints and logic to your app for the server-side dance, implement token refreshes, build & secure your token storage, deal with redirects on the frontend etc.\nBut the worst part is that (almost) every API has quirks and non-standard behaviour. This is why we think open source and knowledge sharing is key here: With the templates in Nango we capture these edge cases and make sure that OAuth just works.\nHow it works:\nNango is a small Typescript/Node.js service that handles the OAuth dance, token storage & refreshes for you. It works with any language, API or framework. It is easily self-hostable for free, or as a cloud service if you want to avoid the burden of securing tokens yourself (that’s how we pay the bills). To get started we recommend you take a look at our Quickstart on the GitHub repo: https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango\nWe currently support 40+ popular APIs. Adding a new one is as simple as updating a YAML file, so anybody can contribute one. In the coming weeks we plan to add a dashboard, a proxy to authorise requests, monitoring and more APIs.\nOne thing we learned from talking to other engineers about OAuth is that everybody has their own horror stories: What was the hardest OAuth API you ever used? What made it so difficult? We look forward to your stories and your feedback on Nango!\nRepo: https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango // Website: https://www.nango.dev\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34693233\nPoints: 165\n# Comments: 38",

It’s been 8 months since I’ve come here. I started as a data labeler, and later CEO gave me data wrangling task. (I’ve been studying data science stuff since the last year on my own) When I completed the data wrangling project, my coworkers who worked with me all left the company. And now CEO wants me to take PM job and start the government R&D project. \n It’s the solution company, so we’re doing multiple project at the same time. I like to experience many different domain, but in this project I need to give the guidance to the juniors who recently come in this company. Even I’m still the junior. I want to go to the grad school to get master’s degree in machine learning in this year. But if I couldn’t get the scholarship I should work longer.\n So here is my question: 1.

          "description": "There have been a few posts of this sub arguing for the description of a data scientist being confined to a singular definition. It is therefore worth starting a thread on the scientific position of “data science” as a field. This is not a peer reviewed work, but we can at least use it to get the conversation going. \n Thomas Kunz defines budding paradigms as a time of fuzzy definition until the field rights itself and clearly defines itself through discussion of what is within its scope of function. He uses the example of textbooks to demonstrate that this is a method of inculcating new members into the discipline. Is that enough to clearly define a data scientist in present context? There are so many “how to do x like a data scientist” type discussions and books. Hopefully we are at the tail-end of the “peak of anticipation” and getting deeper into the “Trough of disillusionment” of the Gartner Hype Cycle.

We know the feeling all too well. In response, we created https://www.mendable.ai/. Mendable is a GPT-3 (davinci + LangChain) powered developer support AI, designed to provide you with customized answers to your problems in real-time.\n We believe that developer-facing documentation should be tailored to the individual. We ingest documentation, community messages, and resources (blog posts, how-to guides, white papers, etc.) to serve as a middle-man between the entire knowledge base of a piece of software and you, resulting in a GPT like docs search. Our goal is to redefine search, making it easier for you to find the information you need, when you need it. Wasting time searching through outdated documentation is something that should be in the past.\n If you want to learn more about what we’re doing, feel free to visit our website and hit us up!\n    submitted by    /u/SideGuideDevs  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Good content is key no matter what type of website or business you run, from blogs to SaaS tools or service based companies. Not only will it help you to rank higher in Google for the relevant keywords, but it also helps to attract visitors by providing them something of value for free to convert them into your funnel with a newsletter or free trial. Usually creating this content either required a lot of time, a lot of money, or both. That is why I launched https://writeseed.com\n It is powered by GPT-3 to create content for you with the help of AI. You only need to provide it with a general niche or keyword and it will provide you with a selection of blog post outlines, which are then used to write a complete 1,000+ word article. You also get a free stock photo which is relevant to the topic each time. The quality of the content is so good, I often get the feedback that people are surprised this is possible at all.\n We achieve these results by using our own proprietary fine-tuning, as well as a special way of processing your input and the output from GPT-3. It took me half a year of research and comparing the outputs of other AI writing tools to get to this point and I am really proud of the result.\n Besides blog articles the platform offers over 20 templates of content, from product descriptions to Tweets, cold emails, Quora answers, questions, jokes, stories, paraphrasing or summarizing your existing content, auto-correct spelling and grammar, press releases, real-estate listings. And we continuously add new templates to cover even more use-cases.\n On top of that we are one of the very few, maybe the only tool, which offers you unlimited content for a flat monthly price. Some of our users are creating 200+ full-length articles per month to rank their websites or run Amazon product blogs.\n Please give it a try with the 7-day free trial, of course you can also create unlimited content during the free trial!\n    submitted by    /u/spacpro  \n [link]   [comments]",
