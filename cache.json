We're starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.\nHow it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.\nWe are a London-based YC company.

          "description": "Michael and Yury here – we're building a no-code analytics platform for growth teams that automatically generates actionable data insights.\nAfter working in the data space for many years, we realized there was still a huge gap in the marketing analytics market. Growth teams have so much marketing and advertising data, yet this siloed data is not actionable.\nThe existing BI and search-driven analytics solutions are designed for data-savvy people. In our experience (previously built an NLP company called FriendlyData), non-technical people just don't know what questions to ask.\nSo we decided to try a different approach: Narrative BI automatically generates a personalized feed of insights. You just need to connect your data sources (takes 2 min to set up), and you will get automated narratives, alerts, and reports in minutes.\nWe currently support UA, GA4, Google Ads, and Facebook Ads, but many more integrations will be added soon.\nYou can try it out for free and give feedback or roast it in the comments section. Just connect your data source, and you'll start getting narratives in 5 minutes.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33627953\nPoints: 23\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "As most know Github released its AI coding tool Copilot last year. It framed the tool as a “pair programmer” - able to help (not replace) programmers in the coding process. \n I came across a study they performed across 2,000 programmers which found:\n  \n88% of users reported being more productive\n 74% responded focusing on more satisfying work\n 88% reported faster completion\n  \nThey also performed a test with approx. 100 participants where they split them into groups to complete a project. \n  \nThose using Copilot completed the project in 1 hr 11 minutes \n Those going solo completed in 2 hrs 41 minutes\n  \nSeems positive for the concept of AI helping talented individuals get better and faster. This could apply to the other areas AI is rushing into this year (copywriting, other creatives). \n Any thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/Distinct_Signature_4  \n [link]   [comments]",
