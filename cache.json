          "description": "Comic Code is a monospaced adaptation of Comic Sans. Designed specifically for programming, which is a corner of typography that involves intensive typing that feels more akin to handwriting than typesetting, this typeface took inspirations from the friendly characteristics and low-resolution legibility of Comic Sans. It is an unapologetic admittance of the positives of the source design, and a literal manifestation of “code like nobody’s watching”. Comic Code only takes inspiration from Comic Sans and was drawn entirely from scratch, in case you are wondering.\nComments",

I've been exploring my future career options and what stuck out to me in particular was data science/ analysis. Now again a quick run down on what I did during the last 2 years, I opted for subjects that were related to commerce and computer science (so economics, Business, CS etc). I actually have a particular interest in computers and coding and so along with the python and SQL we learned in school I also know the basics of C++ and Java. My advanced math skills (calculus, integration etc) arent the best however, I do seem to do well in statistics and probability which I assume is pretty important for such a career.\n ​\n Now coming to my main question, do you think Data Science is a viable career? From what I can see, it seems almost too perfect. But I would like more insight. Is there something I am missing? Is the pay as good as other IT jobs? Is the demand for Data scientists high or will it get/remain high in the future once I get out of college? Is the job any fun (my biggest fear is ending up with a career that I dont enjoy or is depressing as hell)?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/AbelRaijin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "How do you deal with changing features in a regression problem? I imagine this is quite common in a product/marketplace company. Here's an example:\n Let's say the task is predicting car prices for an online marketplace, a value you'd like to present to someone about to list their car on the site. You can use your marketplace's historic sales as a training set. However, as the marketplace evolved, more features were added to the car object, and maybe some stopped being used. E.g., in the early phase of the marketplace, you had 3 features: car model, year, and color. Then maybe later on the company stopped collecting color, and instead now collect MPG and transmission type. So now you have 4 features on the newer dataset: car model, year, MPG, and transmission type. And so on and so on...did you just impute the missing values? not use features that are missing data? Split test/train to only reflect current features? Is it a constant game of cat and mouse keeping up with the fresh features?\n    submitted by    /u/foreignparent  \n [link]   [comments]",
