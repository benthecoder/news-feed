For reference I am currently a rising junior attending a large state university Studying Economics with minors in Statistics and Mathematics. I've been fortunate enough to intern in an Analytics/Modeling role at a large fortune 50 insurance company and also have DevOps experience at a lab.\n Recently though I've been applying to summer 2023 internships and was able to get multiple offers at several large companies. I've narrowed down my offers to two different companies which I will briefly describe.\n Company 1: Large Fortune 500 Banking/Credit firm, located on the east coast, with a high 'prestige' name. Pure Data Analytics Internship (Dashboards, Reporting, SQL, Automation, ETL, etc).\n Company 2: Medium Sized Car Automotive group, located near my current university, offering a pure Data Science Internship (Focus in pricing, loans and credit modeling)\n Ideally I would love to work in Fintech moving forward which is one of the main reasons Company 1 stands out. However moving to Company 1 would be a pain regarding location as I would have to travel across the nation.\n Additionally the experience I could gain at Company 2 seems great, there business model relies heavily on the data science team to develop production level models. Further I've met the team I would be working with and could tell I could learn a ton from them.\n I am aware that the prestige I could gain from Company 1 would be immense, however I am weary to chose the role just because I'm worried it will only lead to more data analyst internships down the line (which I would ideally like to avoid).\n Further, I'm very passionate about ML/econometrics/statistics and although I understand and appreciate the power of pure analytics, I'm worried I could see myself getting bored in a strictly analytics based role.\n I would really appreciate any input or thoughts!\n    submitted by    /u/fleekpanda416  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "AI, another version of the i-life. At least Apple put i-first. Actually, how about anti-i-life? Here, following the operation left to right, you’re operated on first. No thanks, not interested. In many ways your intelligence is already anti (negated) by those with power over you. AI represents a terminal point of the technocracy. AI is the antithesis of sovereign individual intelligence.\n Technology platforms are committing entire categories to AI, medium included. AI is all around us, as if being forced onto us. It honestly feels coercive. We are in the middle of a bubble right now, well, maybe more like a quantum foam. We’ve been automating processes since the industrial revolution, automation is nothing new. You have nothing to worry about, well maybe your job if you work in tech (I’m sure you’ve seen the news).\n Do you honestly think all of this has arisen out of the pure intellectual curiosity of the masses? No, this obsession is being forced upon us by those seeking to ride this wave of investment dollars as long as they can. People are being paid to write about AI. The goal is to captivate the mind while convincing you there is simply no point in resisting. They seem to suggest you should take your own intellect and multiply it by negative one. The message appears something like: “Trust it because you’re not even intelligent enough to trust in your own intelligence.”\n Tech is stagnating and the Metaverse is gasping for breath. We are in the beginning stages of a re-quantization of human prioritization. Surely you’ve heard of The Great Reset. Well, what’s the point in resetting a system only to get the same outcome? I think we need A Great Re-quantization. A movement of individual thought.\n    submitted by    /u/PracticalChicken1  \n [link]   [comments]",
