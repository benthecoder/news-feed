          "description": "Hi all,\nWe're Fabienne and Ewan of Climacrux. Today we're proud to launch our latest project to try and make carbon dioxide removal as accessible as possible: CDR Platform [1].\nIn short: it’s an API to connect to a portfolio of carbon removers. You can purchase from as low as a single gram and select from both natural and technological removal methods.\nLonger: A couple of years ago we launched an alternative to carbon credits, Carbon Removed[2], designed for individuals to buy and subscribe to CDR. But we always had the nagging thought that there was more that could be done.\nCDR Platform is our foundation for that - a simple API to get prices and purchase (at the moment). Our plan is to become the Stripe of the carbon removal ecosystem, seamlessly connecting the supply to the demand.\nWe’d love to hear your feedback. Do you see a use case for this and would you use it? What features have we missed? Do you understand what we’re doing and if not, what’s unclear? We’d love to hear from you.[3]\nMany thanks and happy hacking, Climacrux.\nP.s. If you are a carbon remover, send us your prices, life cycle analysis and some more information about your removal timeline. Our aim is to bring your services to a wider audience so you can focus on reducing our CO₂ levels. Thanks for your work!\n[1] https://docs.cdrplatform.com\n[2] https://carbonremoved.com\n[3] ewan@climacrux.com\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33551066\nPoints: 83\n# Comments: 73",

So, I drew inspiration from social media - where all you need is a couple photos and text fields to get a great site online. So, I think I’ve about achieved a site builder that even my Mom could use.\nThe product seems simple, but there are many under-the-hood optimizations. There's caching, CDNs, custom domain support, TLS certificate issuance + management, dynamically-generated open graph images, image optimizations, email sending, full-text RSS feed, email reputations, and more. It also uses a couple new products to make the domain connection process easy.\nLet me know if you have any feedback or questions!\nPS - Rumor is that Twitter is shutting down Revue. If you want help transferring content and subscribers over to Postcard, just email me!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33549267\nPoints: 102\n# Comments: 68",

However, I upsampled the dataset, and now I have the problem that minority classes get 0% error rate, but majority classes have almost 100% error. I am using random forest and SVM.

They have definitely made a lot of progress over the past 6 months but I feel like it's not enough. For example: When I came in, they used to carry out some AB tests without control groups, and when they did, the sample sizes were guessed completely at random, \"ah let's have 100 in control and 55000 in the test group because we know that the treatment group is going to be positive anyways. \"\n The problem is that I am not taking part in the experiment design and I am only learning about their experiment after it has ended. They only come to me when they need an analysis done. \"Hey we did this experiment 4 weeks ago. Can you tell us if A outperformed B?\"\n Logically I must be involved in these experiments from the very start, and no experiments should be run without my approval. But, being the stats nerd that I am, how can I convince a team of extroverted marketing people that I'm important for ab testing? \n Any thoughts? \n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Puzzleheaded_Fan_283  \n [link]   [comments]",

Apparently the technical skills of the chosen candidate were more or less neck and neck with mine, but the decider was that the other person came across as better on a dimension that to me is a little more vague... basically they said the other candidate asked more of the right questions about the business, they somehow inspired more confidence in the stakeholder interview. I guess they across as someone who is less passive, someone who will take the reins and be more of a leader. \n My mindset is more like \"ok so this company needs an ml model, a db, an ETL setup, dashboards, ab testing etc...\" for me things are more concrete, and I feel like I would rather leave \"driving the business\" to the managers, but in reality a data scientist needs these skills as well.

Therefore, I will need to build Python code as part of the solution to process the audio files and pass them to Whisper/Assembly AI\n It would be nice to set up a trigger that starts the flow whenever a new audio file is placed in a bucket\n We will be processing, potentially, up to a few hundred hours of audio per month (and likely more in the future)\n  \nOne solution I was thinking of was creating a Cloud Function that was triggered when an audio file was placed in a storage bucket. The Cloud Function would then process the file and update a database with the transcription and speaker identification.\n If anyone has experience with or suggestions for how to go about this, please let me know!\n    submitted by    /u/beige_coffee  \n [link]   [comments]",

It can convert alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC) and vice versa or change the voltage or frequency of a current. Power converters are used in a wide range of technologies, …",

          "description": "Now a days, most people are familiar with AI voice assistants and use this technology in their day-to-day life. Recently at Google’s I/O 2018 event, they demonstrated a phone call conversation between the google assistant and a real person. The reason behind the realistic conversation is, of course, the intelligence but also the voice of the AI. The technology used to create a similar realistic voice is called Speed synthesis. In this article, we will be discussing one of the speech synthesis algorithms and try to learn about the architecture and working of the neural vocoder. Following are the topics to be covered. \n https://analyticsindiamag.com/neural-vocoder-and-its-application-in-speech-recognition/\n    submitted by    /u/analyticsindiam  \n [link]   [comments]",
