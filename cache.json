          "description": "I’m a (relatively) new user here, so I’d like to hear from users who have been around for a while (or mods). There have been a few recent posts about (or on) social media, which were not removed, but were both flagged and upvoted by a significant number of users:\nAre you still active in any social media platforms?\nStop writing Twitter threads\nThree things to like about the Fediverse\nFor what it’s worth, I did enjoy reading both of these threads—but I also recognize that the culture of lobste.rs is formed primarily from users who have been around much longer than I have. If these posts are indeed off-topic, should they be removed? If they are on-topic, should a new tag (social-media) be added? Given that a large amount of users are flagging these stories, there is a strong case for wanting to filter them out. A disclaimer would probably need to be added (similar to merkle-trees), stating something along the lines of non-technical discussions on social media or general business news of social media is not allowed.\nI double-checked the about page, and although many things are explicitly off-topic, social media is not mentioned:\nentrepreneurship, management, news about companies that employ a lot of programmers, investing, world events, anthropology, self-help, personal productivity systems, last-resort customer service requests via public shaming, “I wanted to see what this site’s amazing users think about this off-topic thing”, and defining the single morally correct economic and political system for the entire world when we can’t even settle tabs vs. spaces.",

          "description": "Yitang Zhang, the mathematician behind the 2013 breakthrough on bounded gaps in primes, posted to the arxiv today a result which (if correct) comes close to proving the nonexistence of Landau--Siegel zeros: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02515.\nTo give a sense of the scale of this claim: If correct, Zhang's work is the most significant progress towards the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis in a century. Moreover, I think this result would not only be a more significant advance than Zhang's previous breakthrough, but also constitute a larger leap for number theory than Wiles' 1994 proof of Fermat's Last Theorem (which was, in my opinion, the greatest single achievement by an individual mathematician in the 20th century).\nSome discussion / explanation of Siegel zeros and Zhang's claim can be found here:\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/math/comments/y93a86/eliundergradua...\nhttps://mathoverflow.net/questions/433949/consequences-resul...\nAn account of Zhang's remarkable story (and his previous breakthrough) can be found here.

          "description": "So I recently started a new job as a data scientist in a small startup of 10 people approx. My team is me and other 4 interns/juniors w/ a few months experience max, all first job (Im also a junior). Since its a small startup our manager is the CEO. The problem is since he is the CEO he doesnt really have any time for us. He is mostly in meetings with investors and were just thrown in the water with the code and the problems. Non of us had a training of more than 1-2 days besides just a recap of the code so far. We try to help each other but theres a limit to how much an intern can help another intern. We spend hours and days on problems that can be solved within minutes and when the CEO does have time for us he just gives us a hint and not actually sitting and helping or directing us, or we discuss on whatsapp and its unbearable to explain a problem like that or he is just confused with his sh*t and starts a nonsense discussion on something which is not the problem. Eventually we get all the heat on why we are not on schedule or why its taking so long.\n Im doing my best to give results but its very hard when Im all by myself as an intern with no one to ask. Beside it I like the work itself (100% pure Data Science), the location, the other interns. But this work culture is very problematic for me and Im afraid I will end up with experience on paper but no actual knowledge or experience.\n Any advice from you guys will be appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/EmotionalLiving9112  \n [link]   [comments]",

(also train some prediction models) \n What is the correct platform to process the data? Sure I can send queries using bq python api but i wont be able to get all the rows since it takes so much RAM. And getting partial data wont do since trend analysis needs all data rows. \n I tried vertex-ai, Opened up 32 gb n1 notebook instance. loading the data to pandas df failed. It crushed runtime. I made couple of tries. \n I tried using data studio for insight hunt and ploting things. Sure it works but i want to make very different plots to discover the data and data studio is not flexible. i need to write absurdly long sql queries to accomplish something simple. \n What am I missing here? I know dealing with big data is basic for data engineer but I never get to learn it and now i am struggling. I checked tutorials and none of them are actually using real big data.

          "description": "Hi all, I wanted to pick your brains on any project management or tracking tools you use in your day to day data science roles. \n A little background, I work on a small 3 person team, with each of us working on our own individual projects. We do a lot of smaller ad-hoc analytical projects for the organization at large, and we're quite siloed in our work. There's almost zero overlap between our analytical/DS projects. We haven't been able to find a satisfactory project management software or methodology that fits our needs - currently we're using a huge/messy kanban board that our boss manages through Azure DevOps - it is far from ideal since it seems to be geared towards larger agile development teams working on a single project. Our projects are small but numerous, with each having multiple parts. We're using sprints to represent projects, and stories to represent tasks within each project - as you can probably guess, it gets quite messy. I think we'd benefit from something geared towards the solo developer/analyst (since that's basically what we are from a work perspective). Something a little more guided/managed than github docs, but not as as managed Azure DevOps. \n Do you have anything that you'd recommend that you use for work, or even your own solo projects?

I started getting into machine learning because I was absolutely fascinated by some of its applications: prediction of stuff, image recognition, self driving, image generation... I mean there are tons of applications out there.\n I managed to land a job where my time is split between building models for marketing like sales leads and churn models. After a few years I feel like my curiousity has been going down more and more.\n I still enjoy coding, but I am not really excited anymore about the problem at hand. It always more of the same in slightly different clothes.\n I realized that there is little that cannot be done with just XGBoost and ome common sense when defining your dataset. If that doesn't work it's probably not worth it my time anyway and it's time to move and and find another problem or another angle.\n My main issue is that I don't feel like I am on auto pilot either. Each dataset has its own pecularity and you still need brain power to understand how is the data generated, what are the outliers, why are there outliers and the 1000 little things that can go wrong with your assumptions/code.\n Should I start reading more papers?

I use Talend to process results and push to outputs including servers, email, and websites, and then Jasper to write reports with queries to a server I wrote to. Is there a more efficient all-in-one software I could use, or a method I’m not considering? This is not at all what I majored in, I’m just getting into it. I don’t mind legwork or programming, I just fear the day I have to train someone else in this mess (unless this is actually the standard and all you guys could pick this up in a week, in which case I’ll just write this company’s first set of data science documentation)\n    submitted by    /u/LeatherPrize430  \n [link]   [comments]",
