          "description": "Author note: The original title is “Property based testing: tale of two shrinkers”, which is retroactively a bit bad title choice on my part; the title I submitted it under sums the content up better I believe.\nThis is a talk I gave internally at my company (I’m also planning to give an updated version at Haskell Exchange 2022 in a month or so), about approaches to shrinking in PBT libraries and their issues, and how the Hypothesis approach (“internal shrinking”) solves those issues yet remains mostly unknown. There’s also a bit of a call to action to PBT library maintainers to adopt this approach at the end :)\nI’m a co-maintainer of elm-test, the Elm PBT library, which has historically used the rose tree approach (second one mentioned in the video) and recently switched to the internal shrinking approach in v2.0.0. We like it so far!\nComments",

          "description": "Recent trials publicized have gotten me wondering how limited the average knowledge on law is, especially my own, and then I got to wonder how data scientists ensure their work is legal and if their is more pay in having that knowledge. How important is understanding laws relating to data for data scientists, more than a general understanding of domain-specific laws such as PII, PHI, HIPPA, FERPA, and general privacy laws? Is there a niche or need for data scientists who also are educated on current laws relevant to the field/data in general or is the law around it still evolving too fast for such specialization? Are there many companies that are looking for this skillset or do they prefer to allocate all that to a law firm/in-house lawyers?\n TLDR: are legal and compliance data paid more and are they in need?\n    submitted by    /u/Own-Chart2324  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "If you read guidelines for commenting code, they typically prescribe commenting with why you are doing something but not what you are doing or how. The delineation is somewhat fuzzy, but the idea is that your comments should not be akin to:\n \"Doing X to ensure M. Accomplish this in 3 steps: 1. Do y. 2. Do z. 3. Do w.\" \n But rather should be:\n \"Doing X to ensure M.\"\n I find this puzzling. Yes, there MAY be a disconnect between what someone SAYS the code does and what it ACTUALLY does. But this is a feature not a bug: if we review code with the same scrutiny as we would without the additional comments, being able to check that the code does what the author says it does is the easiest way of reviewing the actual implementation of logic of the code.\n In other words, if each line of code does what the comment says it does, it does not mean the code overall accomplishes what it should. However, if each line DOESN'T do what it says it does, then it means the code overall DOES NOT accomplish what the author thinks it does. \n IMO the only downside/risk to more verbose comments is maintenence of the comments as code changes. This is a hazard as comments cannot be subject to testing, but presumably comment review is as important as actual code review. \n Am I missing something? Transitioning from academic and government research to private sector data scientist, the sparsity of comments has proven the biggest change and barrier to picking up others' projects. Even with standardized style, it can take ages to figure out someone's hacked together solution or sufficiently general code to see how it applies to the problem at hand.\n    submitted by    /u/bayonetworking123  \n [link]   [comments]",

Feature A’s type is ordinal values from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6}, with a linear negative correlation with P(Y).\n Feature B is a continuous value between 0 and 1, however, it is not definable when Feature A = 1. For all other values of Feature A, Feature B has a weaker but significant linear positive correlation with P(Y).\n Any idea how I could deal with this? Options I’ve considered, but not yet tested are - Have separate models/mixed effect groups for when Feature A = 1 and when Feature A != 1 - Set Feature B to some arbitrary(?) extreme value when Feature A = 1 - Impute Feature B with its mean when Feature A = 1\n Any thoughts on those, or alternative ideas would be really appreciated!\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/sniffykix  \n [link]   [comments]",

The script basically takes a background image and adds randomly positioned 1-10 laundry symbols in different colors and rotations. No background is used twice. With that script, I generated around 6.000 entirely different images with laundry symbols that every laundry symbol is at least 800 times in the dataset.\n Here are examples of the generated data: Link 1 Link 2\n I combined the scraped and the generated dataset and retrained the model with the same configuration. The result is really bad: the mAP dropped to 0.15 and the model overfits. The confusion matrix told me why: Confusion matrix\n Why is the model learning the background instead the objects?\n First I thought my annotation might be wrong, but the training script from Ultralytics saves a few examples of training batch images - there the boxes are drawn perfectly around the generated symbols.\n For completeness, below are more analytics added about the training:\n More analytics\n Labels Curves More examples from the dataset\n    submitted by    /u/Waterfront_xD  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TLDR: Colab is taking longer to connect to Redshift than Jupyter, and I want to know why\n I am a Product Analyst, and I work with several PM's to get them the data that they need- nothing fancy, they really just want csv's that they can load into pivot tables. For reasons not in my control, we are not doing dashboards (not my call), and I need to get multiple PM's multiple files on a regular basis. \n I am using Jupyter notebook hooked up directly to our Redshift database. I figured I could save myself some work by uploading the notebooks to Google Colab (the company is already on G-Suite), and then the PM's can just run the script, which will automatically pull the data, do the manipulations, and download the CSV for them to use. \n When I tried this, notebooks that ran in 2 minutes or less in Jupyter resulted in run times so long in Colab that the connection to Redshift was shut down.\n Any ideas on why Colab is taking so much longer to connect to Redshift?\n    submitted by    /u/aaquad  \n [link]   [comments]",
