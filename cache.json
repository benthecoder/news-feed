          "description": "rbperf is a Ruby profiler I’ve been working on that aims to incur low overhead, can be run against processes without having to modify or restart them and produces on-CPU profiles rather than accounting for “wall” time.\nIt also has some basic tracing functionality that I am planning to extend. One of the features I want to add before the end of the year is allocation tracing. It can now trace system calls, so we can see exactly which Ruby code called a particular system call!\nThe BPF stack walker is written in C and compiled to BPF bytecode using clang, and the userspace bits are written in Rust, which has been a pleasure to use so far and I believe it’s a good fit for this project. It’s been my first “real” project in this language which has been a great learning experience.\nI’m planning to write some posts on how rbperf works, why it’s been designed this way, and the many learnings along the way thus far :)\nWould love to hear any feedback or ideas. I am still quite new to Rust, and I am sure that things can be improved a lot! Thanks!!\nComments",

I want to be more prepared for metrics that aren't conversion rates. Could be blog posts or books, but ideally would be showing examples that were focused on experimentation / ab testing\n \nIs a language like stan overkill for bayesian ab testing? Doing a bit of research, it seems a bit unnecessary for creating a posterior off a beta prior and binomial likelihood, but not sure about other use cases.

          "description": "Hi all,\n I'm currently in an analytics role and trying to dive into more sophisticated ways of looking at our company's data. One of the ways I was exploring was applying clustering (such as k-means) to time-series data. The only issue is that my object is to find \"users\" and \"devices\" that are anomalous based on hourly traffic. I also have other columns such as \"geo\" as well as some proprietary labels (but the main two are user device combinations)\n My issue is that anytime i attempt to run a clustering algo in Python, the algo just clusters data into it's hourly buckets and I'm not really able to find anything insightful. I spoke to a data scientist who suggested I do the following:\n  \nscale the data down using a scaling method such as min-max scaler(some users/devices will have much more traffic than others)\n Use time pattern as a feature\n  \nI don't understand how to do this.\n For example, this is a dummy version of how my table looks like:\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/oq81i0ube2x91.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=69215e678310c61904386207593df11ad0b797be\n I think what I'm trying to figure out is how to take that data and turn it into a feature:\n {\n \"user / device\" : a / roku,\n \"timeOfHour\" : 1\n \"traffic\" : 100\n ... and so forth\n }\n I'm just stuck and not sure the best place. I also tried reading up on papers but my problem seems fairly unique and I can't seem to find a reference point. Does this seem like the right approach?\n Lastly, when running scalers, am I supposed to run the scaler against ALL of the data? For example, when I applied the robust scaler in sklearn to my data, the end result looked the same when i plotted my charts. My goal is to bring all of the smaller user/device combinations that may have a fraction of the traffic as the top user/devices on the same scale and I'm not sure how to do this. \n Any help/tips would be greatly appreciate and I apologize if the above sounds a bit messy!\n    submitted by    /u/goku_4110  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, \n I'd like to introduce a semantic segmentation model named RTFormer. \n This might be some help to you. Hope you enjoy it.\n ​\n This paper propose RTFormer, an efficient dual-resolution transformer for real-time semantic segmenation, which achieves better trade-off between performance and efficiency than CNN-based models.\n To achieve high inference efficiency on GPU-like devices, RTFormer leverages GPU-Friendly Attention with linear complexity and discards the multi-head mechanism. Besides, cross-resolution attention is more efficient to gather global context information for high-resolution branch by spreading the high level knowledge learned from low-resolution branch.\n Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RTFormer, it achieves state-of-the-art on Cityscapes, CamVid and COCOStuff, and shows promising results on ADE20K.\n ​\n Official code: https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg\n Arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07124\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/l9tdtdvy24x91.png?width=999&format=png&auto=webp&s=73509e6e3f93d11a6ca6957945325c9b4244b457\n    submitted by    /u/Effective_Tax_2096  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I think a lot of the debate on the ethics and legal status of image generation models hinges on the question of how similar their outputs are to their training data. I have not seen very much debate on this topic; the response from most AI people is to roll their eyes, while artists don't have the expertise to back up their claims of plagiarism. But, when I looked, I found at least one example of craiyon nearly exactly reproducing one of its training images.\n Here are three questions that I'm curious about, and that I would love to see rigorous research on:\n For a given output image, can the most similar training images be recovered?\n On average, how many unique images do the models draw from to create their output? (if this can be measured)\n How does each model respond when its prompt appears verbatim in its training set?\n Thanks to anyone who can help inform me about these issues.\n    submitted by    /u/pcxv  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have intentionally structured the program to be paid and remote-first so we can support talent all across the world.\n Our deadline is coming up on November 7th. I would welcome any help sharing this opportunity with ML communities around the world.\n More details below for anyone interested:\n The Cohere For AI Scholars Program supports the next generation of rising stars as they embark on their research journey by providing an alternative point of entry into NLP research. Scholars will have access to a large-scale experimental framework and work alongside some of the best researchers and engineering expertise in the world. Participation is full-time, remote-first and paid. For more details, check out our blog post announcing the Scholars Program launch. Applications are open until November 7, 2022, and can be found here. \n For those undertaking the takehome, would highly recommend joining our discord where we have a highly active FAQ channel for any questions about the takehome.

I think about this more and more, in our compulsively visual culture, which increasingly reduces what we think and feel and see -- who and what we are -- to what can be photographed. I think of Susan Sontag, who called it \"aesthetic consumerism\" half a century before Instagram. In a small act of resistance, I offer The Unphotographable -- Saturdays, a lovely image in words drawn from centuries of literature: passages transcendent and transportive, depicting landscapes and experiences radiant with beauty and feeling beyond what a visual image could convey.",
