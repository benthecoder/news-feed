          "description": "(I noticed this because OpenBSD keeps adding ELF related *_OPENBSD_* flags/types to llvm-* tools.)\nI don’t have any insight or use OpenBSD, but want to check how others think about the feature. Some links:\nHN disccusion in September: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32691701\n\nmimmutable API references in OpenBSD/src: https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aopenbsd%2Fsrc%20mimmutable&type=code\n\n`P[FT]_OPENBSD_MUTABLE references in OpenBSD/src: https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aopenbsd%2Fsrc%20OPENBSD_MUTABLE&type=code\n\n\nlib/libc/sys/mimmutable.2 says “mmap(2), mprotect(2), and munmap(2) to pages marked immutable will return with error EPERM”. It’s likely incompatible with dlclose. This model is likely incompatible with Android Zygote.\nMy understanding of the currently implemented things on OpenBSD:\nKernel-mapped non-writable or non-executable segments are marked VMCMD_IMMUTABLE.\nld.so calls mimmutable on DF_1_NODELETE objects’ PT_GNU_RELRO segments.\nComments",

I recognize its a pretty glamorized field but I was wondering if the people in this thread can outline some of the cons around this field. I have the following questions below.\n - Is this field in demand? and what are usually the entry level requirements to break in?\n - Do Data scientists generally stay in this field long term or do they look to transition? If so, where do they transition to?\n - Is this a field where you constantly have to study and upskill? Mind you, I'm motivated and hard working but having to constantly study in my 40's/50's might be a bit difficult with a family and kids\n -Any other cons?\n    submitted by    /u/71blackbird3  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have an application where I have a dataframe of input data and a dataframe of labels. I want to do PCA on the samples of my input df because I know I have tons of repetitive (not exactly the same but close) data. How can I do PCA so that I know which samples I should keep?\n I've been looking at sklearn.decomposition.PCA, one of its attributes being explained_variance_ratio_ which returns the percentage of variance covered by each component: it does not say that this is sorted, but when I print it out it appears to be sorted from most to least.\n Does this mean that my first samples are what I should take, am I using this correctly? While I can see why the first sample may contain most of the variance relative to each following sample, it is not intuitive to me that the explained variance ratio should be sorted on its own (e.g. it seems like 20 samples in there could be another sample that is highly informative / has very high variance).\n EDIT: My main goal is to determine which sensor measurements I can drop, as I have very dense arrays of many sensors and they all record almost exactly the same thing. It seems like there should be a way to find out which of these sensors are entirely/mostly redundant\n EDIT 2: I am talking about samples not features, I want to reduce the number of samples I need to use since my model takes forever to train. It seems like most people just start small and double their data until they get a good enough performance, but that seems very arbitrary and like there ought to be a better way to do it\n    submitted by    /u/Amun-Aion  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I worked in industry for 7+ years, as a software developer role. Then to enhance my career I enrolled in Computer Science post grad program in one of top universities. Transiting from SDE role to data science role was also one of my goals. I will complete my post grad soon. \n Now am confused whether I should target roles with title \"Data Analyst\" or \"Data Science\". My initial understanding is that data analyst deal less with actual models tweaking or machine learning algorithms / concepts than data scientist. I have few precise doubts:\n  \nWill data analyst profile be substantially poor choice than data science profile? If yes why?\n \nI heard that a lot of non CS grads take up data analyst role. So is it something that CS post grad wont enjoy?\n \nHow hard it is to transit to from data analyst to data scientist? \n \n PS: It may help to answer above question if you understand what I enjoyed in the past. I enjoyed developing complex applications / systems in my SDE jobs. I also enjoyed algorithms, data structures and competitive programming. Currently I have developed interest in reinforcement learning and language models.\n    submitted by    /u/SnooHabits4550  \n [link]   [comments]",

People used to save data in a shared drive, nowadays they do the same - just in Sharepoint. There's backups, yes, but if stuff gets lost over time, then it will probably just stay lost - unless someone remembers that a specific document should exist and where it should be.\n I could definitely automate a lot of stuff for the admin part of processes and establish better structural practices.

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I've been thinking a lot about my data science career and I was wondering if there's a universal opinion on becoming a generalist vs a specialist.\n To give you some context, I have worked extensively on images and videos for 7+ years (a lot of deep learning) and a few months ago, I shifted to tabular data (fraud detection). Here are some of my observations.\n  \nI enjoy solving problems in images, text, video and audio domains compared to anything else (Thanks to my background in signal and image processing). I am not very fond of other domains. \n \nI understand that solving a fraud problem is intellectually very challenging and the stakes are high. I also know that I'm going out of my comfort zone (which is a good thing) and exploring areas outside of computer vision.\n \nI'm facing the explore and exploit dilemma. I can exploit my experience in deep learning, specialize in it, and become a \"subject matter expert\" (whatever that means) in computer vision, audio data etc. This will involve going deep down the rabbit hole in these areas. \n \nThere's the other option of becoming a jack of all trades, get good experience in other domains and work on projects outside my comfort zone. This may also involve obtaining a lot of domain and business knowledge.\n \n However, my career interests are within the computer vision domain. I'm ready to explore and grow within this field. I don't want to be a jack of all trades and work on every possible domain in data science.\n Having said that, what are your opinions and thoughts on becoming a generalist and a specialist? What's more sustainable in the long run? Also, if I wish to grow to the level of a CTO (in a decade or so), what extra skills should I supplement myself with?\n    submitted by    /u/madhav1113  \n [link]   [comments]",

I summarized what I thought most helpful below. \n Is the shift to AI real?\n  \nIn 2022 companies are using AI as a gimmick to test it out. Karen thinks 2023 will feature companies taking it seriously and adoption bringing widespread impacts across industry\n  \nImpact on creators\n  \nSkills will have to be un-learned/re-learned. ex: instead of knowing how to create an excellent oil painting, knowing how to draft prompts that generate equally excellent (digital) oil paintings\n \nThe best will still rise (those who adapt and obsess over the new technology to use it to it's fullest, and especially those who can combine tools to further innovate on their own)\n \nUltimately this shift will hurt some, help others, like any emerging technology\n \n What will happen with regards to ethics concerns?\n  \nKaren has one singular wish on her \"wish list\": that humans take the ethics piece seriously from the start. The downside for using AI \"for bad\" should be drastic.\n \nWill AI-generated content have to be labeled as such? \"Probably\". Like nutrition facts.\n \n What can we do to prepare?\n  \nDon't focus on learning a specific skill. Focus on building your learning skills. Human's ability to learn a skill or pick a singular career and stick with that for life is likely on it's last legs. The skills we have to learn will likely change often, at an ever-increasing pace.\n \nThose who can stay athletic and adapt will win. Those who aren't willing to reinvent themselves will likely fall behind.\n \n    submitted by    /u/Distinct_Signature_4  \n [link]   [comments]",
