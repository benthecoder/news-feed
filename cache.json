          "description": "Hey everyone!\nExcited to be able to share the release of `InvokeAI 2.0 - A Stable Diffusion Toolkit`, an open source project that aims to provide both enthusiasts and professionals a suite of robust image creation tools. Optimized for efficiency, InvokeAI needs only ~3.5GB of VRAM to generate a 512x768 image (and less for smaller images), and is compatible with Windows/Linux/Mac (M1 & M2).\nInvokeAI was one of the earliest forks off of the core CompVis repo (formerly lstein/stable-diffusion), and recently evolved into a full-fledged community driven and open source stable diffusion toolkit titled InvokeAI. The new version of the tool introduces an entirely new WebUI Front-end with a Desktop mode, and an optimized back-end server that can be interacted with via CLI or extended with your own fork.\nThis version of the app improves in-app workflows leveraging GFPGAN and Codeformer for face restoration, and RealESRGAN upscaling - Additionally, the CLI also supports a large variety of features:\n- Inpainting \n- Outpainting\n- Prompt Unconditioning\n- Textual Inversion\n- Improved Quality for Hi-Resolution Images (Embiggen, Hi-res Fixes, etc.)\n- And more...\nFuture updates planned included UI driven outpainting/inpainting, robust Cross Attention support, and an advanced node workflow for automating and sharing your workflows with the community.\nWe're excited by the release, and about the future of democratizing the ability to create. Check out the repo (https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI) to get started, and join us on Discord (https://discord.gg/ZmtBAhwWhy)!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33155074\nPoints: 252\n# Comments: 63",

Here is my data dimension\n Approx n=300,000 p=19\n Response rate is 14% \n Did logistics, rpart, and rf. 10 folds; 2/3rd 1/3rd train test split.\n My maximum AUC is 0.76, But sensitivity and specificity are screwed up. I get a sensitivity of 0.28 and specificity of 0.98. \n What I understand is given 14%, we have medium class imbalance. And the classifier is biased towards the higher class. Hence high specificity and low sensitivity. I tried under-sampling and oversampling. Tried SMOTE as well. Nothing worked.\n All my predictors are highly statistically significantly associated with the outcome on the logistics model.\n Am i doing something wrong?

That's not an easy skill to develop 👏. \n Over time, I've learned that in order to go from SQL intermediate to SQL expert, I need to make my code more efficient, scalable, readable, and easier to debug. \n That's why I'm excited about Ergest Xheblati free workshop this Thursday, SQL Patterns Every Analyst Should Know. Ergest is the author of Minimum Viable SQL Patterns, and he's been mastering SQL for 15+ years In his workshop, you'll learn about: \n  \nQuery composition patterns - How to make your complex queries shorter, more legible, and more performant\n Query maintainability patterns - Constructing CTEs that can be reused. In software engineering, it's called the DRY principle (don't repeat yourself)\n Query robustness patterns - Constructing queries that don't break when the underlying data changes in unpredictable ways\n Query performance patterns - Make your queries faster (and cheaper) regardless of specific database you’re using\n Answers to your questions - Ask Ergest whatever you'd like in the live and interactive Q&A\n  \nIf you'd like to join me and the other 500+ registrants, sign up here!\n    submitted by    /u/JParkerRogers  \n [link]   [comments]",

This person has a lot of experience in business (and was very successful) but not anything science-y. The job I'm in the process of applying for was advertised via a recruiter.\n Problem: The proof-reader stated that I should re-write the cover letter in Word as it \"looks better\" and recruiters will prefer that as it's something they recognise. I disagree on the first point (but I guess it's subjective) but don't know what to think on the second point. So my question is, should a cover letter be in LaTeX or Word?\n I doubt it matters but just in case, I'm in the UK.\n Edit: In case it wasn't clear (which apparently it wasn't), I'll of course be compiling the LaTeX into a PDF.\n Edit 2: Thanks all for your comments, they have produced some good points to consider.\n    submitted by    /u/t-w-b-  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As teams integrate ML/AI models into production systems running at-scale, they’re increasingly encountering a new obstacle: high GPU costs from running models in production at-scale. While GPUs are used in both model training and production inference, it’s tough to yield savings or efficiencies during the training process. Training is costly because it’s a time-intensive process, but fortunately, it’s likely not happening every day. This blog focuses on optimizations you can make to generate cost savings while using GPUs for running inferences in production. The first part provides some general recommendations for how to more efficiently use GPUs, while the second walks through steps you can take to optimize GPU usage with commonly used architectures.\n Read on for more here.\n    submitted by    /u/modzykirsten  \n [link]   [comments]",

But my teammates think we won't be able to finish this in a month as it may require learning advanced NLP and we are just beginners in AI. I think I will be able to do it because 1) it's interesting, 2) I will follow the top-down approach and learn the topics as and when I encounter them, 3) It's an application and not a research paper. \n What do the experts here think?

You can download it with the following command directly in the Jupyter notebook:\n !pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git \n Whisper needs ffmpeg installed on the current machine to work.

I'm a third year CS student, and want to make a Voice Assistant to control and navigate a PC, specifically aimed for blind people in Pakistan, for my semester project. It'll take urdu voice input and handle basic things like searches and selection, but then because it's aimed at the blind, also things like current position, what's on the screen at the moment, reading out articles, rereading what's already been entered into the search bar etc. I have a basic idea of the things I'll need, like an urdu speech recognition library, text-to-speech convertor for the assistant to be able to speak and the PyAutoGUI Library to actually control the cursor and keyboard input etc., but honestly apart from that I'm completely lost. Is this project too ambitious or too basic? What else will I need? Should I have an assistant that only recognises set commands like go back, read etc. Or should I try to go for an assistant that understands the semantics of whatever the user says and grasps what it needs to do from that? Is that even possible? Also should I restricted the scope to just a browser, like as a chrome extension handling searches and websites etc., or general computer control?\n    submitted by    /u/Aggravating-Floor-38  \n [link]   [comments]",
