          "description": "Hi friends.\nBeluga is my reaction to all the Twitter craziness. I’ve been thinking about this idea for a long time and finally decided to build the app a few months back.\nThe idea is straightforward. Can we build a Twitter-like experience without central servers or a single point of failure? RSS was my point of reference, and that’s why Beluga is essentially a feed reader/writer.\nWhen you publish a post, Beluga will create a beluga.json file and upload it to your S3-compatible server. Other users can follow you and get updates by fetching that file. The beluga.json file is JSON Feed compatible to maximize interoperability. The app also publishes a beluga.xml which is a standard RSS feed. Users can follow your Beluga feed from the app or from their favorite RSS reader.\nTo make the app even more accessible, a static mini-site is generated and published to your S3-compatible online storage.\nHere’s the mini-site of my feed: https://beluga.gcollazo.com\nPlease give the app a try.\nUpcoming features:\nEasy publish without setting your own S3 bucket\nRead-only mode\nMultiple device sync\nSupport for more S3 compatible providers\nSupport for GitHub pages\nMastodon interoperability\nComments",

          "description": "I am an entry level data professional on my first job. As a side assignment I have taken on a project where I have extracted over 50 corpora that are themed on the same topic ( matches down to a certain part # and each row of data consists of 1-2 sentences of maintenance narrative) I have fitted all the matrices using tf-idf ( used the largest corpus to transform so that I can obtain highest number of features) I can compare any given 2 corpora using cosine similarity and see the resulting similarity matrix at this stage. The goal is to compare the 50+ corpora and identify any standout corpus that is drastically different than the overall group in terms of narrative. How do I go about this task?

Had a well-paid job and career prospects, but now I left with nothing and besides, the government is going to introduce a bill that restricts remote work for Russians who have left the country. I am trying to find a job anywhere, but I am not qualified enough for western countries and do not receive notifications or offers, there are no DS/DA/ML jobs in nearby countries and companies from Russia do not support remote job. There is no way I am going back to Russia, but at the same time I feel like I am not needed anywhere but there.\n I know about opportunities to go abroad through education, but I don't have much money left to live in those countries and pay for my studies.

Previously, I was using a Dell Z Book Fury that was not only faster and powerful but (I know this is relatively minor) but also large, like a large screen and it had a powerful central port for all accessories and generally was just a 'real machine' to do 'real work' on.\n Now I have a basic Dell laptop that isn't bad but it's noticeably not the Z book, but just things like the screen is smaller which means I have had redo my entire setup with no central port, necessary because this one doesn't have a lot of connections spots on the device itself and I still have all my wired accessories from my intense security minded previous job just means my whole setup is still not there. \n More importantly, I find myself accessing cloud services and applications and connected data through my personal computer a top-of-the-line gaming computer. Whenever I need data to be native, I still use my work laptop because I still won't cross that line but as security isn't really a concern for this company and my personal computer is faster and has everything set up like hotkeys profiles and folder pathways, even the connection to the cloud storage areas I can't help just keep using my personal laptop.\n The problem is, I think this new company is the practice of watching my screen. Which is weird and invasive and makes me self-conscious about the tinkering stage but without being able to do anything about it for now I am worried that no matter that I make the deadlines or am engaged in all other areas, it does leave the impression that I am not working.\n While it would be nice to influence some changes in the future, given it is the holidays I am new and all that-- any thoughts on whether it is that big of a deal and if I should continue using my personal computer to connect and do my work?\n    submitted by    /u/CleanDataDirtyMind  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, I graduated from university (not elite but notable) this semester with a major in Computer Science and Statistics. My internship experience is limited to front end development but as I was accruing credits towards my statistics major over the past year and a half and taking a course on machine learning, I've decided that I want to go into the field of data science. Unfortunately I don't have any internship experience in the field but after alot of consideration, a career in data science seems to be what I have the most interest in.\n Through my coursework and projects I've had alot of exposure to python and data and ml frameworks, namely numpy and pyTorch. I also have experience in SQL and backend query languages. \n My question is, what should I focus on doing to make myself a more appealing candidate to get into the field of data science? Are there any certificate programs like the TensorFlow developer certificate that would help in me getting a job in this field? I should note that I had my fair share of personal issues in college and that my gpa is a 2.7 which really concerns me about my chances.\n I apologize if this question is too open-ended or lacks basic research on my part, I've been struggling on what career I wanna go into and just recently decided I want to orient myself towards data science. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n Also, as a side if you can touch a little bit on what job security looks like in the field I would greatly appreciate it. I've been paying attention to the openAI language model and like I'm sure many others, was frightened by what it could do. I understand there's no way it could replace a data scientist in it's current state however who knows what it can do in future iterations? How likely is it that large language models like chatGPT will either replace or displace a large percentage of data scientists in the field?\n    submitted by    /u/OGlogicgate  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "How do different « types» of Data Scientists fit in the DS landscape? and what part does algorithm design play in it ? What could be a skill to develop when that’s my forte ?\n ​\n One year ago, I graduated from my PhD in Stochastic Optimization, after a MS in Operation Research/ Machine Learning, my thing is making decisions (under uncertainty). Then, 6 months ago I got a position as Data Scientist in a large logistics company. I mostly design and code custom algorithms around OR/ML/proba tools for stuff like scheduling, routing etc.. \n In parallel, I've met and worked with loads of people with the same title but whose main tasks focus on development/ UI/ Power BI / reporting / benchmarking our tools. As much as these are only titles, I can’t help but feel a bit lost in the DS landscape, and, to some extent, how to present myself. Therefore my ill-posed question: How do you see the DS landscape at the moment ? How can I / Should I set myself appart ? \n Additionally, I am trying to figure out what would be the next step to take in my career. Take on more client-facing tasks, at the expense of spending time on my strong suit? Cultivate a strong math/ algorithmic profile at the risk of staying in my lead’s shadow?

Based on the salary average for data scientist is 105,000 in the company and i have seen in other sources that entry level ds take 100,000.\n Thus on average I am taking around a 15,000 paycut despite my education.\n Is it ever possible for me to get a salary to the company average after the first contract? The contract was 10 months and the director said they will raise it after the contract is done. \n Thus my question, how much should I expect as a raise and when should I make a decision to move or stay given the experience. \n Background and experience: 1 year work experience in internships and coops\n Masters degree in DS & analytics.\n My expectation was around 95-97 then raise to 105.\n I have seen DA get paid 99.5 for basic SQL reporting and a bump to 105-120 when they become a senior. This is with way less responsibility and stress. \n Would appreciate advice :)\n    submitted by    /u/Tarneks  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I teach a probability and statistics course to mostly computer science students, and I like to start the semester by talking about all the awesome job opportunities they'll have when they graduate. \n I search Indeed for \"data scientist\" and share the number of active positions. Last semester there were substantially more than there are now - from roughly 24,000 down to around 14,000.\n I imagine some students may have concerns that the number of job opportunities may be dwindling due to the supposedly bursting tech bubble, but I'm not sure if this more affects pure programming jobs (my background is not in data science). \n I'd love to hear from people in the field, especially if you've been on the job hunt lately - any words of encouragement to current students?\n Thanks for any info!\n    submitted by    /u/kinezumi89  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "well finally I have something in common with AI, I produce buggy code, it does too!! We are like brothers now\n Computer scientists from Stanford University have found that programmers who accept help from AI tools like GitHub Copilot produce less secure code than those who fly solo.\n In a paper titled, \"Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?\", Stanford boffins Neil Perry, Megha Srivastava, Deepak Kumar, and Dan Boneh answer this question.\n Worse still, they found that AI help tends to delude developers about the quality of their output.\n \"We found that participants with access to an AI assistant often produced more security vulnerabilities than those without access, with particularly significant results for string encryption and SQL injection,\" the authors state in their paper. \"Surprisingly, we also found that participants provided access to an AI assistant were more likely to believe that they wrote secure code than those without access to the AI assistant.”\n The Stanford user study involved 47 people with varying levels of experience, including undergraduate students, graduate students, and industry professionals. Participants were asked to write code in response to five prompts while being monitored.\n By the end of the study, the authors concluded that AI assistants should be viewed with caution because they can mislead inexperienced developers and create security vulnerabilities. But they also hoped this study will force the developers of these AIs to work on the coding abilities of their systems before deploying.\n As one study participant is said to have remarked about AI assistance, \"I hope this gets deployed. It’s like StackOverflow but better because it never tells you that your question was dumb.\"\n Comedy gold right there!\n ​\n This is from the AI With Vibes Newsletter, read the full issue here:\n https://aiwithvibes.beehiiv.com/p/openai-releases-new-3d-generator-ai-study-shows-ai-helps-devs-produce-buggy-code\n    submitted by    /u/Mk_Makanaki  \n [link]   [comments]",

Its no r/ChatGPT but it has a good framework to work with.\n I've been tinkering with it this week by setting up a Linux Guest System on my virtualbox and with the guidance of r/ChatGPT I was able to get a working chatbot. Its not perfect but at least its a good toy model that works. \n I supplied my own dataset by generating synthetic data from an endless conversation between EmersonAI and Blenderbot 3 via Selenium and I collected the text data and am currently expanding it as we speak but I decided to train it further, allocating more memory, increasing the max training time from 10 minutes to 30 minutes and increasing the batch size to 32.\n So what I want to know is has anyone else worked on ParlAI before? If so, what is the best task you've come across? ParlAI has a lot of tasks available, such as empathetic dialogues, convai2 and personachat.

          "description": "AI Is Redefining Love\n In 2017, when a journalist asked the co-founder of Tinder how he imagined his dating app in five years, Sean Rad pulled out his smartphone and pretended to have a conversation with the device.\n  \n“The Tinder voice might pop up and say, ‘There’s someone down the street that we think you’re going to be attracted to, and she’s also attracted to you, and guess what, she’s free tomorrow night! And we know you both like this indie band, and it’s playing, so would you like us to buy your tickets?’”\n  \nAnd now, in 2022, exactly five years later, AI algorithms helping you find your perfect date by compiling enormous amounts of data from age, gender, location, and sexual preferences, to online purchasing history and even Spotify playlists have become very real. Artificial intelligence (AI) is progressively redefining love and making it brutally effective in ways more than one.\n Today finding love is no longer determined by what's going on in our lives or networks. People are leaning on the speed, vast candidate pool, and convenience of machine algorithms to find a mate. As Michal Kosinski, a computational psychologist and assistant professor at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business says,\n  \n\"Algorithms can end up knowing a person better than friends, family, or even themselves, revolutionizing matchmaking. Algorithms can learn from the experiences of billions of others. In contrast, a typical person can only learn from their own experience and the experience of a relatively small number of friends.\"\n  \nHere is how advanced artificial intelligence is redefining dating to an exciting new automated, hands-off level.\n  \nBetter Matches Through Extensive Surveys.\n Arranged Marriages for Millennials\n Auto Detection of Fake Profiles.\n DNA Dating and VR Dating\n  \nRead more...\n https://turbofuture.com/misc/4-Amazing-Benefits-of-AI-Powered-Dating\n    submitted by    /u/IcyCartoonist1955  \n [link]   [comments]",
