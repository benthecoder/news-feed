Let's say these treatments are in the field of risk management so their targets are anything but randomly chosen. However, the reasons for choosing treatment A over treatment B are opaque and differ from case to case so there are no obvious set of covariates. We do have a hunch of which attributes have a say in treatment selection so we have created a dataset containing ~ 40 covariates. Half-decent model can be built using these to predict whether observation X gets treatment A or B so propensity scores are a good and possible option. \n I don't have a lot of data so I prefer to use methods which don't lose data (so no CEM matching for example) \n Here comes my question: can I just opportunistically try a whole bunch of different covariate balancing schemes and just pick the one which seems to produce the best results, eg most balanced data set? Or should I first try to narrow down the set of covariates on which the balance is desired? (balancing a covariate which is in no way related to getting treatment is moot). When different schemes might produce even quite wildly different estimates, how to gauge which is the most plausible one? \n I do know that treatment A produces better results than treatment B, both data and theory support it.

          "description": "Hey all, I am in need of help from the Reddit hive mind! A while back (probably over a year ago) I found a resource put together by an AI researcher/academic, that outlined a self-study curriculum for learning the foundations of AI. It was a fairly barebones/old school web page, that outlined a sequential curriculum you could use on your own to get up to speed. If I remember correctly it was quite in depth, in that it was laid out to match a typical 4-year undergraduate degree. I'm super interested in finding it again, but unfortunately my Googling skills seem to be lacking. If anyone knows what I'm babbling about and has any ideas, that would be of massive help!
