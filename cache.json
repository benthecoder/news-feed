          "description": "Hi all, I'd love some clarification on these dimensionality reduction methods. I see PCA/PCR recommended as the go-to method for this type of task and almost never see people talk about using PLS to get principal components. It's my understanding that the key difference is that PLS considers the target when making components. \n Intuitively, I feel like this would make PLS stronger in many datasets, as it uses more of the available information to better inform the creation of components. I'm not an expert here and don't actually have a ton of expertise with how either of these methods work on a deep level, so any feedback from more experienced data scientists would be much appreciated.

When I'm trying to extract the areas of the properties, I'm getting a lot of NaN values (~80%).

Device Id- unique string 3. session_start_time- timestamp 4. session_end_time- timestamp \n It's possible for users with different deviceIds to have overlapping sessions. The goal is to have one row per user per overlapping session. So let's say that I have a session on my phone from 10:30-11:30, and on my computer from 10:45-11:45. The goal would be to aggregate this into a single row:\n  UserId|session_start|session_end aaquad|10:30|11:45 \n My strategy was to use a lag to bring up the next row in order to be able to compare them- and the recursion would have been required in cases where a user had 3 or more overlapping sessions.

I can hum the music in parts but I was wondering…\n Is there an AI music generator where I can hum a melody, tell it what instrument to use, and it will produce that melody in that instrument for me so I can slowly build up my entire song?\n I’ve been able to think in music like this since I was 12 but I could never show anyone. I want to show them now that AI has become powerful enough.\n Any help is gratefully appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/ZephyrBrightmoon  \n [link]   [comments]",

I haven't checked to see if other ai is doing it also. \n Here are some pictures of actual 80s and early 90s movies to see what I mean. \n https://preview.redd.it/1ent8icky0ia1.png?width=1524&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2262e9e5b16a45e81fe4c1933bb32321c3adea6\n https://preview.redd.it/d52fp69ay0ia1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=052d984a558606754a462e581fff0d631f38a787\n https://preview.redd.it/fx1jh2alx0ia1.png?width=2800&format=png&auto=webp&s=491388b6bbccccb6756b7acf23f165c52660abc7\n https://preview.redd.it/e7gav84rx0ia1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dc41e5a6339f7e0f340d663454a462f4a53e6c7\n https://preview.redd.it/a77210wsx0ia1.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=214ffe76580b4eef9db249e60953c55f68163fa0\n    submitted by    /u/The_Philosopher_Guy  \n [link]   [comments]",
