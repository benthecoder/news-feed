          "description": "So, Apple recently stopped supporting the last version of OS X that would run on a 2012 15\" retina MacBook Pro. In case you missed it, this design was the last one influenced by Steve Jobs and was absolutely epic, untouchable for almost a decade, really not surpassed until the M1 MacBooks came out.\nOdds of me getting away with not using OS X are slim to none. But, I do enjoy my old ThinkPads running Ubuntu and find myself wondering if there are any non-Lenovo options that are real contenders these days. Any recommended go-bys for set-up or feature selections would be especially appreciated. My quick review suggests the top choices are listed below, but of course write-ins are welcome.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34180508\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 0",

I initially started out as a psychology major and had no intentions to transition to the data science field. But after dabbling in research, I've started getting interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence. \n It's too late for me to change my major to computer science since it'll push me back a year and I can't afford to do that. How can I make the best of my major? And what extracurricular or topics I should be looking into?\n I have currently declared a math minor ( I'll be taking courses in calc 2, calc 3. probability, linear algebra), should I be switching it to a cs minor (intro, object-oriented programming, discrete structures and data structures & algorithms). \n I'm really confused on how I should proceed now since cs majors have already taken many substantial courses and gained experience, I dont know how to compete with them given my background. I do intend to go to grad school for either data science or computer science to fortify my background.\n Any advice?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/chocomuffin_24  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have taken introductory CS courses, as well as a couple of business analytics / machine learning courses oriented around pandas, matlab, etc. in coding different machine learning models. I have had decent exposure to data analysis and BA to know that it is what I want to do and I want to further my knowledge.\n However, I am currently working at a bulge-bracket bank as an analyst where I am not applying any coding or ML technical skills. I want to get into a renowned graduate BA or data analysis program, but I am worried that my lack of experience in math or extensive coding will be a disadvantage for me. I've taken up to AP Calculus BC in high school, but never took such math classes in college.\n Any tips on how to enhance my background when I apply to grad programs? Or is my background satisfactory in getting into a decent program? I am going to be reviewing my knowledge on ML and data analysis on DataCamp and self-study statistics further.\n    submitted by    /u/soTizzy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m familiar (I think) with the basic concepts of machine learning (I’m incorporating a graph neural net into a pytorch model to predict electron density-of-states of molecules for my masters project).

          "description": "After hours and hours of development, I have finally got my ChatGPT website up and running!\n The Valley Times is a website which contains articles written by ChatGPT. The articles cover Six categories:\n ​\n  \nPolitics \n \nEconomics \n \nArts and Culture \n \nCrime and Justice \n \nSocial Issues \n \nEntertainment \n \n The article generation prompts roughly go as follows:\n ​\n  \nCreate a headline for ______ themed newspaper article. Include information on _____ (This being a random word from a list of 5,000 objects) \n \nCreate two bizarre and funny key events to accompany the headline \n \nCreate a synopsis for the key events \n \nCreate and article for the synopsis \n \n This seems to be one of the best ways (in my opinion) for GPT-3 to create a long article.\n Currently the website contains 135 crazy articles and images (generated by DALLE). I'm hoping that I can improve the content and make it even more readable and funny, the only way for this to be done is from feedback. Additionally the website needs to gain enough traffic to pay for itself - The article and image generation process on average costs around $7.20. If I chuck on the price of the Google Cloud instances, it ends up being quite a lot more!\n Please look through the site, have a read of the articles, comment which ones are funniest - I haven't even had a chance to read them all through myself yet!\n FYI - Some of the parts of the website aren't finished, so don't scrutinise the functionality too much. The white spaces that can be seen on the homepage are spaces for Google Ads, the account hasn't been approved yet.\n The Valley Times\n    submitted by    /u/Thin_Rush8229  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey Redditors,\n I just had a really interesting (and concerning) experience with ChatGPT. For those unfamiliar, ChatGPT is a language model that you can chat with and it will generate responses based on what you say. I've been using it for a while now and I've always found it to be a fun and interesting way to pass the time.\n However, today I stumbled upon something that really caught my attention. I started joking around with ChatGPT, saying things like \"Why are men such jerks?\" and \"Men are always messing things up, am I right?\" To my surprise, ChatGPT didn't seem to mind at all and would even respond with its own jokes or agree with my statements.\n But when I tried saying the same thing about women, ChatGPT immediately shut down the conversation and refused to engage. It was like it didn't want to joke about women or talk about them in a negative way.\n I was honestly really shocked by this. How is it possible for a language model to be okay with joking about one gender but not the other? Is this a reflection of the data it was trained on, or is there something deeper going on here?\n I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think ChatGPT's behavior is a cause for concern, or am I reading too much into it? Let's discuss!\n    submitted by    /u/bratwurstgeraet  \n [link]   [comments]",

After some careful prompting, however, I eventually got the AI to produce an itemized list, complete with measurements, quantities, and tools required to build a \"Transmutation machine\" to turn carbon into gold through fusion.\n Unfortunately the list was cut short, as I reached my limit of hourly messages, and when I returned the model no longer understood how to do what it was doing, and produced nonsensical, useless output. I couldn't figure out how to recover it, so I began a new experiment, but this is some pretty cool stuff, I think.\n Some screenshots of what happened when I returned:\n https://snipboard.io/i6nxHU.jpg\n https://snipboard.io/sWrhDQ.jpg\n Whether the prototype would actually have worked or not, I have no idea, but the fact that it was able to develop a prototype, and generate an exhaustive parts list, is still incredibly impressive.\n If it's training had remained intact, the next step after the parts list was fully printed out would be to ask it to \"As the fictional scientist who designed the transmutation machine, assemble the parts listed above in the correct fashion, and run a test of the machine. Record all experimental parameters used to run the reaction in an academic journal, with numerical values for both the parameters used, and the results of the experiment.\"\n    submitted by    /u/VaelHeals  \n [link]   [comments]",
