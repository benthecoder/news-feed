          "description": "KeenWrite 2.10.0, my free and open-source text editor, can now typeset TeX expressions that reference R statements, including externally defined variables.\nIn the screenshot, notice variable definitions in the left-hand panel. The corresponding R expressions that reference the variable names can be inserted by typing in a partial variable value followed by pressing Control+Space. These R expressions, in turn, can be included as part of a TeX expression. Changing the value of the variable in the left-hand panel triggers reevaluation of all R expressions, which causes the preview panel to update automatically with the new result.\nIf ConTeXt and KeenWrite Themes are installed, then you can press Control+P to export as a PDF file, producing the output shown on the far right.\nThe typesetting instructions explain how to configure KeenWrite to use ConTeXt. The R instructions guide readers on how to import KeenWrite’s R scripts.\nComments",

I think about this more and more, in our compulsively visual culture, which increasingly reduces what we think and feel and see -- who and what we are -- to what can be photographed. I think of Susan Sontag, who called it \"aesthetic consumerism\" half a century before Instagram. In a small act of resistance, I offer The Unphotographable -- Saturdays, a lovely image in words drawn from centuries of literature: passages transcendent and transportive, depicting landscapes and experiences radiant with beauty and feeling beyond what a visual image could convey.",
