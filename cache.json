          "description": "I've been looking at some Kaggle resources and many high ranking participants offhandedly say that an important part of doing well is designing good model validation. However, I'm a bit confused as to how to discern a \"good\" way to validate a model from a way that is a little \"less good\". For the sake of this post lets only consider different types of cross validation strategies.\n ​\n As far as I understand the purpose of model validation is to provide some sort of estimate for the expected prediction error when the model is asked to predict on unseen data. I think I also understand that a \"good\" validation strategy should be one where the folds that you're training and testing on have a distribution similar to the data and respect certain properties of data. For example, for a time series you would not use random k-fold cross validation but you would rather make splits where you train on some time window and predict on a future window. The difference here is clear cut.\n However, suppose for a particular time series problem one has several candidates as to how to perform cross validation on a time series in a way that respects the time aspect and also attempts to capture other aspects of the data distribution. How would one test whether one of these cross validation strategies is better than another? Does one select the validation strategy that has the most stable predictions on the hold out folds? Does one keep another hold out set and compare the errors on the holdout folds to the error on the hold out set and then pick the validation strategy with the least discrepancy? Furthermore, it seems like designing a validation strategy is a step taken before modeling actually starts so are they evaluated by just some sort of baseline model? Appreciate if anybody could shed some light on this.\n    submitted by    /u/SavingsMortgage1972  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each row contains a unique ID which is broken apart by the columns.\n If we liken the data to in the CSV to be for example products in a shop (it isn't but I am trying to generalise so not to give away specific work information), you could think the columns describe the products a bit like this:\n  \n product_id color size weight avg_time_between_sales number_sold_ly \n  \n ​\n Normally, to analyse this data, I would sit there and create loads of different pivot tables and graphs to try and slice and dice this data in loads of ways to come up with insights, however I have up to 12 different columns per product_id, and some things I might want combine columns to look at (E.g instead of looking at number sold for just red products, maybe number sold for red products between 0-5kg and red products between 5 - 10kg).\n ​\n I was wondering if there was some sort of machine learning model or data science tool that would essentially let me input my CSV and then automatically perform a variety of correlation tests etc to start showing me insights. Does something like this exist?\n ​\n If it helps, I can use Python well and so really I'm looking for the modules and maybe some documentation that lets me plug and play.\n Thanks everyone\n    submitted by    /u/unatural_yogurt  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been asked to perform some analysis on a public-use medical dataset. Thing is that the number of features is too high, with more than 2,000 features to deal with. I've never faced analysis on a dataset that big, so I don't know the best way to perform a correct feature selection in order to reduce the problem dimensionality to a bunch of most-relevant features. From your point of view, what's the best strategy to face a problem like this?\n    submitted by    /u/NathanDrake27  \n [link]   [comments]",

For that, my historical dataset has multiple date columns such as open date, close date, last updated date. I have researched and read that i can divide date to 3 new columns, Date, Month and Year. Since this is a classification problem, I'm thinking to use Logistic or Decision Tree. Can someone please guide me on how I can use these date columns correctly?

Our ultimate vision is to empower individuals to become any character and exist in an endless, open-world narrative that unfolds based on the interactions in a scene. We invite you to experience our beta demo, readily accessible at https://quantum-engine.ai/\n Drawing inspiration from The Matrix film, the Quantum Engine demo allows for a unique conversational experience with the character, Morpheus, in the iconic “Construct” scene that evolves in real-time. Available in over 30 languages, with the capability of conversing in 6 languages (English, Chinese, French, Japanese, German, and Spanish), the potential opportunities for interaction are limitless. Additionally, the ability to spawn objects within the Construct using only voice commands, such as \"Spawn an [object] in the construct\" or \"Give me an [object] in the construct.\" The ability to generate objects in real time provides a glimpse into the long-term vision of bringing a scene to life in real-time.\n In the upcoming release, we will introduce the ability for anyone to upload their own scripts, allowing Quantum Engine to generate a personalized experience for your favorite movie, show, or game.\n    submitted by    /u/techmanj  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "so i am pretty sure everybody has been amazed by the potential of chatGPT and openAI's future products. However, I feel most people seem to ignore one huge problem that chatGPT has, it's their \"content filter and ethics guidelines\", which I feel is super biased.\n I remember the first day chatGPT went out, some people bypassed this filter and could ask chatGPT to help them create molotov, but openAI kept adding more and more filters so people couldn't bypass this anymore. And recently Time media investigation published a report on how openAI hired $2/hour kenyan slave labors to filter contents on chatGPT.\n I know AI is here to stay and will replace a lot of jobs, but it can only go mainstream if it doesn't have censorship that openAI put on its products. Because if AIs can keep adding more \"ethics\" filters, most politicians will just put pressure on openAI and other similar companies to help them detect and filter out oppositions to create very biased narrative and mass censorship. and you cant do anything about it because their source of truth will be considered \"ethics guidelines\". \n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/fabzo100  \n [link]   [comments]",
