          "description": "I found a lot topics on reddit and in general with the title \"R vs Python\", which one should I choose / learn / stick with etc.\n I learned both languages and used per project always one of them. However I wonder how much of you use for a single project both languages? To be more concrete:\n  \nR for the whole cleaning, preprocessing and explorative data analysis part (and nice ggplots). Also for feature engineering and feature selection.\n Python for everything that follows: Machine learning model training, tuning, evaluating and deploying.\n  \nWhy R for the preprocessing, EDA and feature engineering? -> Because working with tidyverse + ggplot is really fast and nice. I'm much more quicker than with Pandas/Matplotlib/Seaborn. Statistical functions are pretty good supported there. Also generating PDF/HTML reports work well.\n Why Python for everything else? -> Because ML like Deep Learning has better support there. Also the deploying part (APIs etc.) are better supported in terms of libraries/frameworks etc.\n View Poll\n    submitted by    /u/malirkan  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can also play with the parameters of the diffusion model depending on how gnarly you want your resulting image to be.

To my understanding, if features are too highly correlated, they might hinder a model’s performance (since they look more like dependent than independent variables).\n Since learning about feature engineering, I’ve had the intuition somehow there’s a way feature engineering can cause collinearity between the created variables and the existing ones if certain principles aren’t considered. But I haven’t been able to identify under which circumstances.\n The background or question itself might be wrong, but: is there a way feature engineering could cause collinearity?

Now the opportunity has come up for me to work for equity rather than a wage. They will likely offer 1% or 2%. Similar companies have sold for between $10M and $20M. I'm wondering if anyone here has done something similar, if you have any tips/suggestions, if you know how it would work with a buyout, and anything else if think I should know. From my simple perspective if I had 1% and it sold for $20M that would be $200k (which is about my TC in my regular job). Don't get me wrong $200k is a good chunk of change, but it's also not guaranteed and I might not paid until anywhere from a year from now to ten years from now. This company cannot be the next twitter or Facebook or anything so o think the $20M valuation is probably the max. \n Any advice is appreciated\n Edit...also to clarify confusion the alternative is not a full time salary at $60/hr. That's the wage I make doing work for the company--it is contract work now and it is not my primary job. I suspect I would work about 400 hr/year for equity or 300 hr/yr paid\n    submitted by    /u/PBandJammm  \n [link]   [comments]",
