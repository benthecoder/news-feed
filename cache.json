          "description": "Hey HN, cofounder of Readwise here. We've been working on this cross-platform reader app for about 2 years, excited to finally share it in public beta.\nProbably the most notable thing that makes Reader unique is that it supports almost any content type you could want to save/read/highlight:\n* web pages\n* emails/newsletters\n* PDFs\n* ePubs\n* twitter threads\n* youtube videos (with transcripts)\n* RSS feeds\nWith all of your knowledge content in one place, we built powerful reading and highlighting, as well as a bunch of novel triage/organization features, so you can actually consume & stay on top of that content!\nThere are also a lot of advanced features too, such as text-to-speech, GPT3 questions/summaries, super powerful highlighting (that includes markup and images), complex filtering/search (with our own query language), sleek mobile triage UI, keyboard shortcuts for reading/everything, integrations with note-taking apps, a browser extension for both saving pages and highlighting them, and much more.\nIf anyone's interested in more product details, as well as our business model, etc, we wrote a detailed launch post: https://blog.readwise.io/the-next-chapter-of-reader-public-b...\nPredicting a common question: Reader is part of the Readwise subscription pricing right now in beta -- there's a 30 day free trial and then it's paid at ~$8usd/month. We also promise to not raise this price for existing subscribers.\nReader is also fairly technically interesting -- our iOS, Android and webapp all work fully offline and sync your reading data/progress with eachother. Our search on web is built with wasm sqlite. We have a fairly intense pipeline for cleaning web articles (removing ads/styling). We share lot of modules around syncing/highlighting across all platforms, etc...\nHappy to answer any questions :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34006202\nPoints: 149\n# Comments: 62",

          "description": "Hello,\n I am looking for feedback on an idea I'm working on.\n It's a desktop application that will allow you to open the most common data file formats (CSV, JSON, Excel, Avro, Parquet etc.) and explore their contents in a nice table, you'll be able to search, filter, sort, group rows or run custom SQL.\n From the table view you can also create charts and export them as images, or export a subset of the data as another data format, so you can effectively convert between data formats too.\n In the future I might add some data cleansing features but for now it's just viewing / analyzing.\n The idea is for this app to be kind of a data swiss knife, something you reach out when you have to quickly view a file and don't want to write a script or import the data in a database.\n It's still early days and got a couple of people that are interested, but I'd like to validate the idea further by verifying that I am actually solving a problem, especially for people that work with data.\n I have a couple of questions:\n Would you find something like this useful in your day to day? Would you pay for it? If not you personally, would your business pay for this so your team can use it?\n I would really appreciate any feedback, thanks a lot!!\n    submitted by    /u/wratuxx  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have some funding to build a machine and am planning to also use it for training some deep learning models. So I'm currently considering an Intel i9 13900k, 128GB RAM, and an RTX 4090 GPU. But would I benefit from a Threadripper pro CPU for GAs? It wouldn't do much for deep learning but if it would benefit GA work then I could justify it.

          "description": "Researchers in Israel have come up with an artificial intelligence tool capable of analysing ECG tests and predicting heart failure with an unprecedented accuracy rate.\n According to the Times of Israel, the technology is currently being used for patients who suffer from myositis — a condition that significantly increases the risk of heart failure.\n The AI model was updated by feeding the data from ECG scans and medical records of 89 patients suffering from myositis between 2000 and 2020. The report claimed that the AI can understand subtle patterns in the ECGs and predict possible heart failures well ahead of time.\n Head Researcher, Dr. Shahar Shelly of Rambam Healthcare Campus said:\n “We are running ECG tests through the AI model, which sees details that doctors can’t normally detect and then predicts who is at risk of heart failure,” said Shelly.\n “Given that it’s these cardiac dysfunctions that often end up killing people, this can save lives.”\n Another Game-changing development from AI, and this one is absolutely MASSIVE\n ​\n This is from the AI With Vibes Newsletter, read the full issue here: https://aiwithvibes.beehiiv.com/p/ai-porn-billie-eilish-goes-viral-tiktok-chatgpt-brutally-destroyed-pun-competition\n    submitted by    /u/Mk_Makanaki  \n [link]   [comments]",
