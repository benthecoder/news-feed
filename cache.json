I would like to discuss with you the importance of adopting a platform for ML projects life cycle and whether the platform might be really a block for junior practitioners. \n For more than two decades CRISP-DM was the de-facto standard for data science process life cycle. There was other alternatives but it seems it gained popularity as it covers the end to end steps and it was simple to adopt. IBM was pushing it as well. \n In 2016, Microsoft proposed a new variant of CRISP-DM called TDSP (Team Data Science Process) but for reasons that I do not know, it did not become an alternative for CRISP-DM on the market. In 2021-2022, Azure, AWSm and GCP (maybe others) embraced MLOps.\n I have some questions for long time data scientists please. How important for your practice is to adopt a life cycle process? \n Is anyone still using CRISP-DM at the enterprise level? Any large enterprise adopted TDSP? \n Although MLOps might have some deficiencies, do you think it will be the new CRISP for the coming years?\n    submitted by    /u/bilalak  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am trying to predict whether a question will receive an accepted answer using the body text, title, and post tags. Roughly 51% of all posts have an accepted answer so the data is nicely balanced.\n I cleaned the text by getting rid of HTML tags and code chunks, while retaining some of that info with counts and booleans and added some additional basic features (body length, number of sentences, number of code blocks, day of week, hour of day, etc.)\n I tried using Tfidf on the body text with only incremental improvement over a model with base features. After learning more about Doc2vec I gave that a try with no improvement over Tfidf. \n I find it hard to believe that the title, tags, and body text have no information that would lend to better prediction accuracy. Am I approaching the problem the wrong way or is NLP just not the right tool in this situation?\n Fwiw - I'm using grid search to optimize along the way (classification algo, Tfidf/Doc2vec params, etc.) and taking different sized samples from 10k-5M with samples larger than 100k generally not increasing accuracy. I'm also using CV for training then refitting on a test set with best params.\n    submitted by    /u/Pepperoneous  \n [link]   [comments]",

On the public leaderboard I was 1/18 (.004 ahead of #2) but dropped to 6/15 (and .01 behind the used to be #2) on the private leaderboard. Im trying to figure out how this happened. Did I overfit to the kaggle test set? I noticed my earlier submissions (like from 2 weeks ago) did the best. Can someone give me a pointer? How can I avoid something like this from happening again?

I'm still doing a lot of learning in this field so I would still appreciate any help I can get, even if the answer is obvious. I'm not sure if this belongs in stack overflow or not, but I thought I would give it a try here. \n ​\n My understanding for clustering has always been that you never need to split the data to training and testing since you don't have any labels or are ignoring the labels. But from some recent reading that I have done online, I see that some people are saying that train/test splitting is still necessary for some clustering algorithms (those that generate centroids). So I just have some scenarios listed below, and I was hoping if some people could help me better understand what I have done wrong …",
