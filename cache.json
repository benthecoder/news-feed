Select one of the datasets to see a preview of its contents including its schema. When you are ready to do some visual analysis, simply provide a natural language description of what you want AutoPlot to do.\n I look forward to hearing your questions/feedback.\n Hope you find it fun!\n https://autoplot.app/\n    submitted by    /u/Swimming-Nebula-4012  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not a data scientist, I just want to ask for your help/advice, since I figured you guys might be good at solving this kind of problems.\n My goal is to write a program that can find associations between random words.\n Like if I give it a word \"cat\" and a word \"dog\", I want it to be able to return me the words like \"fur\", \"tail\", \"pet\", \"mammal\" - all the things these two words have in common.\n I want it to work even for words that don't have a lot in common, or find associations that aren't obvious. Actually, that would be the main purpose of this model.\n So if I give it two words like \"baby\" and \"onion\", I want it to output words like \"crying\" (since both babies and onions are associated with crying). Or \"cake\" and \"cow\" would both output \"food\".\n Do you think that's possible to do? How would you approach this?\n    submitted by    /u/lumenwrites  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a administrative analyst job where I have a small limited data project. With this small project, I've used a little bit of SQL to manipulate the data with it and I'll start putting together a simple report with Power BI next. I feel way more comfortable using Excel. I know how to do lookup tables and formulas from before, but not pivot tables yet(hopefully this week). I've started doing some studying to brush up on potential statistics questions in interviews. I plan to try to take a course on Python also. I'm going to try to put together a portfolio of some work online. \n I want to become a Data Scientist eventually and starting as a Data Analyst seems like a good way to get my foot in the door. \n  \nI'm wondering how difficult will it be for me to get a Data Analyst job? I've read anecdotally that hiring is slowing down at the moment.\n Should I focus on larger companies or smaller companies? \n Any other advice on what I can do to improve my chances of getting a Data Analyst job?\n  \nThank you for any advice.\n    submitted by    /u/hoopsfan888  \n [link]   [comments]",

A Floating IP is an IP address that can be instantly moved from one Droplet to another Droplet in the same datacenter.

Taking part, you will interact with secure enclaves, differential privacy and synthetic data and become familiar with some of the leading privacy data science libraries like OpenDP (Harvard), SmartNoise (Microsoft) and DiffPrivLib (IBM Research). \n There are also going to be a number of venues around the world where you can join in in-person and meet like-minded data scientists. The first location announcement was Harvard's John A.

Most of the time I do descriptive analyses with my team on tabular data with a goal to find where models can be useful. I also worked with scrapers, models and modeling pipelines a little bit. My boss told my team that we have budget for self development, so he encouraged us to use this funding for something useful for us, so I am looking for any relevant courses. I checked courses on coursera and they seem to be more entry level. I already had MLops course from coursera which I liked since it covered a lot of things we could possibly apply in the future. Tbh I have a feeling that I can get more knowledge from reading articles and relevant books and doing small projects, but funding has to be used, so. Do you have any interesting recommendations? Now I am considering to take something from Andrew Ng classic, since we don't have a need to use any neural nets on tabular data and I start forgetting things. I also have a feeling that I don't know statistics as well as I supposed to, but I am not sure there are any online courses which cover more than the average course in my uni.

One I set my eyes on is human trafficking, but I suspect it requires heavier intelligence type of work, where familiarity is key (though I have experience with that), and less an occasional data analysis project. In case of any relevance - I’m living in Europe, but happy to look at any opportunity that has no issue with remote work.\n    submitted by    /u/InnkaFriz  \n [link]   [comments]",

The thing I'm struggling with is trying to figure out how to describe or frame the AI and how a world could have been molded to accept the judgement of an AI in place of a court that has always been served by humans. \n Does anyone have any thoughts or ideas what an AI like this could like? What kind of thinking would it have? What would its framework and basis be to determining the validity of law? Could it actually interpret passed the written letter of the law? Even though is in a future America (probably over ~100 years into the future), what kind of dissent would exist against it? \n Any and all input would be greatly appreciated. Also, any resources to be pointed to, more on the AI philosophy stuff would be great too. Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ThainDC  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd like to stay within Europe, due to financial constraints.\n I have a strong interest in topics across the field (so as well as ML, things like Multi-Agent Systems(!), Ethics, Neural Networks, evolutionary/bio-computing) and would like something that isn't mainly ML. I'm thinking of doing a Master's at King's in London since the course seems well-rounded, but I've talked to someone who did the course and they feel that half the courses are lazily taught and lack depth (lectures that barely cover a topic, no practicals, tutorials without many questions, teaching only narrow parts of a field).\n I'm aware UvA is popular, but it's a two year course. Leuven's on my shortlist in particular (the modules look great: link) but I've since found someone on here complaining about more or less the same thing as KCL - many lazily taught courses, no practicals, etc. so now I'm not sure..\n I'm aware no course is going to be perfect and that you get out what you put in, but it'd be nice if the courses were somewhat detailed.

          "description": "Before we talk about replacement, let us try to understand the real value of a good programmer. A good programmer’s value is not merely knowing \"how to code.\" Programmers bring value by understanding \"what to code.\"\n Simply put, they need to understand the business value of each requirement to be built and decide and prioritize their development based on the criticality. In a nutshell, they have fully functional \"thinking\" human brains.\n And the AI we see today is data-based. Yes, it can do things like categorizing images on Google, reading license plates, powering the routines of Alexa and Siri, and even using highly sophisticated methods of classifying data and recognizing patterns.\n But it cannot think like a human brain. For AI systems to be capable of 'thinking,' they need to be continually trained and fed with giant data banks covering every possible human scenario. This is not 100% possible.\n That is why AI can write code but can't ensure that it has written the correct code. It cannot understand the business value of features. It cannot refactor an old, buggy code and cannot decide whether to remove a piece of code or not.\n So, the future of software development and AI is collaboration and integration. AI will help programmers redefine programming by taking over tedious, repetitive tasks so that programmers can focus on building something great.\n Programmers can also pair with AI to write better software and reduce development lifecycle times. And far from replacing programmers, AI is becoming ready to reimagine a programmer’s workload through integration and enhanced efficiency.\n Here are five benefits of using AI in software development:\n  \nAI can validate project requirements\n Automatic debugging\n Automatic testing\n AI can make programmers more efficient\n AI will change software development\n  \nRead more...\n https://turbofuture.com/computers/5-Benefits-of-Using-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Software-Development\n    submitted by    /u/IcyCartoonist1955  \n [link]   [comments]",

As maintainers of the opensource nebullvm inference accelerator, I am very eager to see the performance of AIT compared to other inference tools.
