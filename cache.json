          "description": "So as title suggests I did Mathematics and Statistics for my undergrad. I'm now looking at Grad Schools in the US or EU for Data Science or Statistics with a lot of CS/Data Science classes.\n I've looked at some and they seem to be geared towards people from maybe a science background but even some from humanities. Looking at some of the Maths and Stats classes material I'd be wasting my time redoing a lot of my undergrad and probably just bored, I really struggle to motivate myself in this environment so would be a waste of my time and that place someone else might thrive in.\n Looking for recommendations of grad schools, programs which are geared more towards people coming from math heavy majors. Or that are at least accommodating of students who would want to study across different departments, say CS and Statistics or even CS and Engineering.\n Seems a lot of places have just rushed together data science masters and aren't too polished. I'd be happier just doing a straight up CS or Stats masters as long as they school would let me study a broad range of topics from Stats and CS that are applicable to Data Science, even if some classes were unaccredited.\n Open to schools anywhere in the world but ideally US and Europe as I can work there without needing additional visas etc.\n    submitted by    /u/SuddenInterest  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, it's becoming increasingly difficult to manage and keep track of everything as the number and scope of our projects increase. \n Consequently, we are ideally looking for an organizational system that would allow us to be able to easily visualize the structure and details of projects, standardize how everything is recorded, trace out our work with clarity (for recordkeeping and replicability purposes), store away metadata on all the different moving parts of our project, and generally just maintain a good sense of what's been created and where things are at. These best idea we've come up with so far is pairing up a flow-chart software with a well-structured Notion document, but we'd like to ideally minimize the complexity and number of moving pieces here.\n How are other data science teams organizing and structuring their work?

          "description": "Some job postings want people who are able to write \"complex\" SQL queries to interrogate data, but when I look on Google I haven't seen much of a consensus on what \"complex\" is, with some websites suggesting that something as simple as calculating the monthly salary for an employee given the annual salary qualifies for \"complex\", all the way to 20+ line queries analysing churn rates over multiple months, which I can see why they can be called as such.\n So I am wondering, what is in your opinion the minimum complexity to match the definition of a \"complex\" SQL query?\n    submitted by    /u/William_Rosebud  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "AI technology has become incrementally better since its inception. The quality of generative AI output has now come to the point that is meaningfully good for creators and businesses. For instance, before 2020, the majority of use cases of AI (or rather traditional AI) were in spam detection and translation. That has changed now. More and more creators and marketers are using generative AI outputs for writing emails and promotional blogs. For writing that requires more creativity, generative AI outputs are already being used as first drafts, which for the time being, require further refinement. Leading US-based VC firm Sequoia Capital estimates that as the generative AI models are further improved, the technology will be able to write final drafts as good as if not better than, professional writers by 2030. \n Some investors are likening generative AI to the early days of the web, seeing it as a transformative platform shift. US-based VC firm Sequoia sees generative AI as a technology that could generate trillions of dollars of economic value. As the demand for AI-powered content generation accelerates, generative AI start-ups have been garnering significant VC attention despite a broader slowdown in the pace of VC funding. Jasper, an Austin-based start-up, recently raised $125 million in Series A funding at a $1.5 billion valuation. London-based Stability AI also raised $101 million in an oversubscribed round, with investors like Coatue and Lightspeed Venture Partners participating. In May, Hugging Face also raised $100 million in a Series C round at a valuation of $2 billion. \n Read on...\n    submitted by    /u/Sienna_99  \n [link]   [comments]",
