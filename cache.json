They have data on people who use their services versus people who use traditional psychotherapy, and want to analyze whether people who use their proprietary service spend less money overall on healthcare bills.\n As part of the question, they asked how I would find other factors related to how these groups differ. I said that you could use linear regression to learn about linear relationships of variables in the data. They asked how this would work. The interviewer suggested using money spent on healthcare for a given month as an outcome variable and what service they used a binary regressor, and then suggested adding new variables to that equation to test for their efficacy. This, in hindsight, makes sense. I instead suggested using what service they used (traditional psychotherapy vs. their proprietary program) as a binary outcome to a logistic regression, and then introducing variables to see what makes these two groups different. In hindsight, this doesn't relate to the question of money spent on healthcare for a given month and doesn't make much sense.\n I want to have a stronger grasp of this problem and an understanding of how to solve similar ones. What are peoples' thoughts for this problem here? Does anyone have suggestions on resources to learn more about using linear models for inference?\n    submitted by    /u/i_am_baldilocks  \n [link]   [comments]",

This year I switched jobs to what I thought would be similar at a family friends company but learned it’s not, and I’m just generally not happy at the job, so I’ve been thinking of going back to do a data science boot camp to learn python, R, and visualization of data and SQL. I don’t have a 4-year degree but worked in my data analysis entry job for 2 years and loved it then left for more money which I regret. So my question is. Do you think data science boot camp would be worth it for me to do? Or are they not looked at very highly like say other boot camps? I know data science is what I like to do so that’s why I’m thinking of going back. (Plus if I stay at my current job I will explode)\n    submitted by    /u/iiimrgiii  \n [link]   [comments]",

I finish in 2 years (3 years if I take up honours). However, the university hardly offers statistics courses along the AI major. I would learn this entirely on my own, separately, which I am willing to do.\n The downside is, my resume has online Stats courses as opposed to a Bachelor.\n Option 2:\n I enrol in a new university (which is highly regarded). I finish in 4 years. I take up a double in CS (major in AI) & Science (Statistics). A solid in-depth study course. I'm assuming this gives me a leg up.\n Just wanting to get any feedback from anyone in the industry. Looking at employability and potential quality of work produced.\n I'm an extremely detailed person, and love to produce good work. Is this still possible if I have to teach myself statistics undertaking online courses? (One thing I love about university is the ability to continuously and intensely build on top of previous knowledge, and then use that knowledge.

          "description": "I don't really know anything about AI but after reading a bit and seeing the recent hype this question popped into my mind.\n For example, with self-driving cars. I was thinking that maybe it would be technically possible to create one using conventional programming, but realistically speaking this would take such an impossibly long time that it would never be viable, because of the complexity. So you use AI to train the car to drive itself instead. \n But with conventional programming, someone has intentionally written all of the code to do specific things, so it can all be explained by the creator. If you're using the AI like in this scenario, to create something that is basically impossible for a human to program themselves, does that mean we don't actually know how it is working? \n I get that you have the basic principles like the neural networks on which it is trained, which you would need to know to create and train the AI in the first place. But after that, you can't actually explain the decisions it's making? You just know you asked it to do something, and you know it worked because it did it. \n Is this wrong? I would love to hear more about this. I was thinking this would be especially dangerous with very intelligent AI.
