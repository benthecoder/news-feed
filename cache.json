          "description": "Hey HN!\nFlappyBirdle combines elements from the game Flappy Bird and the popular word game Wordle. I wanted to see if I could make a game that added urgency to Wordle, while also feeling outragous at the same time. I think I achieved it with FlappyBirdle. Every time you type a letter of the word, the bird flaps its wings and you get closer to the goal. It also has an easy mode that ignores the pipes, so even beginners can get a good score. Let me know if you have any ideas on how I can make it better!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34685086\nPoints: 91\n# Comments: 52",

          "description": "Any other mid career DS out there job hunting? How’s it going for you? Best wishes to anyone else caught up in layoffs or job insecurity!\n I have 7.5+ yrs of DS experience, and was laid off after not opting into Twitter 2.0 in November. I spent >3 years at Twitter, and it was honestly one of the most rewarding jobs of my career. I loved the people I worked with, I loved the domain I was in and it was one of the most “impactful” roles I’ve ever had. It was definitely a mindf*ck to watch the acquisition in person and see everything I’d worked on basically get thrown out the window (and to see so many amazingly talented colleagues tossed out and/or disrespected). I spent the last few months recharging, relaxing and processing everything.\n Now that I’m back on the job market, I’m revisiting all of my old interviewing and imposter syndrome anxieties. I’ve always gotten excellent feedback and performance reviews and know I was a highly valued member of my team. And it’s pretty satisfying to have so much experience under my belt this time around. But with the weird job market and so many other tech layoffs (and knowing that everyone I worked with at Twitter is also actively on the market) I am second guessing everything. I have also only applied to a handful of roles because not many openings have caught my interest. On one hand I want to wait to see if the job market improves later in the year, but I’m also stressed about not having much to say for myself when asked about my job search. \n I also get flustered after talking to people who say things like, “oh your field is so hot you should have multiple offers within days!” Fortunately my partner is very supportive, and I’m generally able to talk myself back to a good place. Today was just one of those rough days when my anxiety really spiked.\n    submitted by    /u/DS_CareerMode  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "BLUF: What is the number of interview cycles you typically conduct at the same time while being able to make a good impression? \n I find the data science interview process a bit like having a second job. The questions span a huge breadth of topics but also often cover those topics in depth. In my role, I'll usually be focused on one type of problem at a time, but in an interview, I will go from live coding advanced data manipulation questions to deriving gradient descent, calculating confidence intervals, and demonstrating business acumen in the course of an hour. The interviews are usually multiple rounds and take up my entire afternoon and weekends studying/interviewing.\n That said, there is a lot of overlap between topics I need to study for interviews from different companies, and it helps to have competing offers. I would like to know, what is the number of interview cycles you typically conduct around the same time while being able to make a good impression? There is definitely a balance between spreading yourself too thin and putting all that effort into a single role that you're competing for, I just haven't found it yet.\n    submitted by    /u/Wasatch_Wanker  \n [link]   [comments]",

Next to that I can make websites using Sveltekit so for smaller companies/ startups I can help start them up in the digital world. But that is a bit out of the question I want to make in this post. But maybe it connects the topics a bit in form of web analytics.\n In what area's of digital marketing can data science be beneficial for smaller/ local companies as a service? I am continuously thinking of analytics being more applicable in this case.. Does anyone have any sources that I can read through that touch on this subject? I am also happy to hear your opinion on this.\n    submitted by    /u/Darkcount2011  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey Redditors! \n Upon searching for methods to find errors within tabular data, I wasn't able to find much so I decided to write my own notebook and article.\n In the article, I outline the necessity for data-centric techniques and how you are able to get model-agnostic improvement by improving the quality of your data. Not only does this improve model performance by itself, but it also leaves additional room for the usual model improvements (hyperparameter tuning, architecture optimization, etc).\n I go into more detail in the article, but at a high level I:\n  \nTrained the baseline xgboost model on the original data (67% accuracy)\n Used data-centric techniques (cleanlab) to find label issues within the dataset\n Dropped the incorrect data from the training set\n Retrained the same XGBoost model on the better-quality data (90% accuracy)\n  \nIn doing this, I was able to see a reduction in error of 70%. The raw increase in classification accuracy went from 67% to 90%.\n I hope this will be of value to those working with tabular data and machine learning.

          "description": "On LinkedIn I see more and more people labeling them as data scientists, AI experts and what-not offering paid courses, interview training and resume review. Often, they have a non-data-science background and very little experience working as a professional. Quite common to show a previous job as a data scientist with a tenure less than 1 year (or multiple).\n I know it can be appealing, as their message is often, everyone can be a data scientist, machine learning engineer or AI expert. Academic and professional degrees are overrated and it’s enough to take a Udemy or Coursera course to become a data scientist (affiliate link included). Simply follow them and buy their resources (which is usually very general advice, you can google in a few minutes).\n But the reality is: They are usually not the experts they pretend to be. They typically don’t talk about expert topics, they talk about career, current hypes, and about very high-level projects. Sometimes they have a GitHub account, but they have no commits of just copy-pasted repositories from other people and some very basic entry-level stuff. They are usually on LinkedIn, Instagram, and YouTube and in podcasts, but never talking about expert topics.\n Don’t trust these people and don’t buy courses there. Everything you need is either free of charge or it’s a professional degree. There is no easy-going way to become an expert in any topic. The only good advice these people can give is how to become a fake AI influencer. \n If you are looking for good advice, look for experts with a clear professional track record (several years), academic publications or talks at industry conferences and articles/blogposts about specific expert topics.\n    submitted by    /u/rudiXOR  \n [link]   [comments]",

Yes, of course. \n Would that phrase be coming out of his mouth at this point if not for the release and success of ChatGPT? No. \n 2) their mission: “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”\n There’s a book called The Innovator’s Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail. \n I'm certainly not here to say that Google is going to fail, but the re-stating of the mission makes it clear that they view AI (and Bard) as a way to improve, supplement, and perhaps protect their search business.

People have been giving me lots of positive feedback and I've been using it myself so I decided to upgrade it and make it into a web application and incorporating AI-assistance features into it, see link, screenshot and video below.\n Link: Storycraft \n Screenshot\n Video\n It's a writing tool that serves a certain writing process where you can structure and break the story down from top to bottom, similar to the snowflake method. The app makes it easy to create and navigate your story structure - acts, chapters and scenes. It allows you to create notes that you attach to these sections, and keep them separate from the text.\n It features basic AI-assistance features, that I personally found very helpful in my writing.\n It's free, unless you want to use the AI-assistance features which are currently available to try out for free, but will require a subscription if you want to keep using it.\n I hope you find my upgraded writing tool useful and I'm open to any feedback or suggestions you may have.\n    submitted by    /u/myrealword  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "​\n Characters as shown on https://chatfai.com/characters/\n Hi everyone!\n I have recently made some exciting changes to my ChatFAI web app.\n  \nThe public characters library is now live - it's now easy to share and install public characters.\n Added a regenerate reply option.\n Created a new plan without any daily limit.\n  \nI have gotten a lot of help and support from this community. The feedback and support from you all are really helpful and that is how I am improving ChatFAI (based on the feedback and suggestions).\n So, here I am again. What do you think about the latest updates? Is it going in the right direction?\n Another challenge I have not resolved yet is finding B2B use cases for ChatFAI.\n Thank you for your help and support - it's greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/usamaejazch  \n [link]   [comments]",
