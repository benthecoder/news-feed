But I keep thinking this: what if it turns out to have no significant impact till the next few months?\n I talked to my manager about this, and even though he has assured me that I wont be laid off, that at the worst if the next few months the project does not yield any positive results and that I may be shifted to snother project, I am not sure of what should I do.\n Should I prepare for a possible layoff? Or should I plan to leave just in case this whole thing goes south? \n Have you faced a situation like this wiht yoir career? What happened then? How sre such situations usually resolved?\n I am looking for people in senior positions, ones who have seen the landscape of this industry for quite some years to provide me advice on this. I am a fresher with around 2 years of experience. And I also have a master's in data science from one of the top government institutions in India. (Just giving out some details for context).

I have not graduated with my bachelors yet but I believe over the summer I should be able to finish core req classes and should be golden.\n I currently have experience working with R, Tableau and Tableau Prep. I have been fortunate enough to work at a start up company and really gain a lot of exposure to other tools such as Heap and Salesforce. So far I have 8 months of experience.\n During these 8 months I have completed a series of deep analysis of the company products and its customers. Worked from analyzing customer behavior, after cleaning really messy historical data, to creating customer segments based on the key performance metrics I also had created. Using Heap, I had to define UI code of our plattforms to then make analysis of user interactions. Report those findings and suggest areas of improvement.\n I feel confident in cleaning data but, as its notoriously known, I do take my time because I don't like finding later mid-analysis that the data is off. Whenever I find myself repeatedly doing something on excel, I create executable R scripts to speed the process. I often do this when uploading data into Salesforce.\n I plan to read some amazing resources I found for ML and statistics and apply some concepts into the company. I found that this start up in particular is always open for new ideas and projects.\n My current goal is to shoot for $80k salary once I graduate, how realistic are these goals?

I couple of times it has cited specific books or papers by title and author and, as far as I can tell, the books/papers don't exists. The second time it did this, I ask it why it makes this kind of odd mistakes and it said:\n \"As a language model, my information is based on the text that I have been trained on, and I try to provide the most accurate and relevant information based on that data. However, I am not infallible and sometimes make mistakes or provide information that is inaccurate or out-of-date. I apologize for any inaccuracies in my previous responses, and for any confusion that they may have caused. It's important to know that the information provided by AI models like me should be taken as a starting point for further research and not as the final answer. It's always a good idea to consult with experts or verify information with multiple sources. Again, I apologize for any inaccuracies in my previous statements and any confusion they may have caused.\"\n But it is still weird that it would make up specific books and papers, I don't see why a language model would do that.\n Edit: Maybe the text that it is trained on references specific books and paper that don't exist. And I guess that would be text that are not indexed by Google and other places where I am doing my fact checking such that I cannot figure out where it is getting this stuff.\n    submitted by    /u/facinabush  \n [link]   [comments]",
