So we took to the official SmartScreen feedback site to report the false flag (as the website owner). Received an email that stated it would take up to 24hrs to analyse: 'If the status of your site has not changed after 24 hours, please contact us with a reply to this message'.\nSep 8 - first ticket sent.\nSep 9 (24h later) - nothing. So we replied to the message as instructed.\nSep 12 - still nothing. One more reply sent. Asked some of our customers to report our site as safe.\nSep 15 - crickets. Tried calling phone support, impossible to get through; they just hang up on us. Reached out to MS support on Twitter, said they would look into the case.\nSep 22 - no changes - MS twitter support has been unable to find the correct person internally. We replied to the SmartScreen ticket once more. Opened two new tickets. Asked more customers to report the site as safe.\nSep 30 (Today) - now the warning has started to spread from our login page to our entire dashboard. Still no word from Microsoft.\nWe are totally baffed that MS allows a false flag to stay up this long, totally ignoring us for almost a full month, meanwhile destroying a business that did nothing wrong...\nWe suspect one of our competitors is responsible for falsely reported us. Is 'weaponized SmartScreen' a thing?\nDoes anyone have a similar experience? Any advince on resolving this matter is greatly appreciated!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33036748\nPoints: 116\n# Comments: 71",

The bank was also incredibly supportive and sponsored my move from Europe to the US, and I am now living in NYC.\n The role I do is a weird mix of a lot of things: I still do a lot of analysis and work with predictive modelling, but I just as easily also do web app development, task automations, I've built emails and solutions in Python to maintain those emails, worked with UNIX servers, worked on ETL pipelines, a really weird m…",

For example, some show horrible response in one area, but response in another is good. (I get confused if I should exclude this sample or if some interaction effect is occuring).

          "description": "I recently go a job offer for a new job with an amazing company for more than a 35% raise. The thing is the job is a 6 month contract and while they have a very strong history of hiring contact employees, in the interview i asked what the odds were of me being hired and he said he couldn’t have a solid answer and that the budget is decided in the new year and it was out of his hands. He made it clear that he was very interested in having me become a full time employee. \n Another thing he mentioned that kind of through me off was he was suprised about the fact that i had a full time job and wasn’t currently doing contract work. He then said “i shouldn’t really be saying this but as a friend i would be hesitant about leaving a full time job for a contract esp bc he cannot gaurentee me full time and that with the way the economy is going it could be risky”\n Would love if anyone would like to weigh in. I like my job now but this raise would be great and the company is a fairly big one that i would love to be at. I’m fairly early in my career with only 2+ years of experience. Wondering what the job market would be like in the event of a crash. \n NYC based.\n    submitted by    /u/Kyle0person0moo  \n [link]   [comments]",

People saying that it's stealing, \"not real art,\" \"not real artists,\" lazy, dystopian, evil, and just downright immoral. These takes are so baffling to me, because all I see is artists bashing a new artistic medium. Just like what people used to do with digital art.\n As an artist (not to humble brag) but I worked goddamn hard to do what I do! I practiced really fucking hard and didn't give up. At the same time, I am immensely privileged to have had the time to practice, study, and money spent on classes growing up, and on quality supplies.\n But not everyone has that.\n Those people are deserving of having a creative outlet like everyone else.
