Segment (variation and segment are used interchangeably) A and B.\n We need to have a sample size of 8K per variation. \n We run our test and in the end we realize that there are 500 customers in segment/ variation A have moved to variation B and 500 customers from variation B have moved to variation A. \n ​\n Now you want to analyze the data. What would you do with these 1K customers? \n ​\n It depends on the type of hypothesis that we have. Let's say we want to measure the changes in customer behavior (if the segments are about loyalty, are customers moving between these segments or not?), then I would say this movement between categories is what I need to have. Otherwise, for instance, when I want to see what is happening to an attribute to certain types of customers, I would remove those 1K customers from both parts. \n ​\n Is this a correct answer? If not, what's yours?\n    submitted by    /u/Wafer_3o5  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Suppose we have a solid ML model lifecycle setup that includes a pipeline covering everything from data ingestion/transformations to model building to model comparisons/eval to model monitoring, which in turn has the ability to kick off a model refresh that becomes a “challenger” candidate to replace the currently deployed model. Further, suppose the cost of running this pipeline is negligible (highly automated and low enough compute/time cost that we can run it every day without concern if we wanted to).\n Does model monitoring become an unnecessary “middle man” in this situation?\n I can think of 2 reasons we might still want model monitoring in this situation: 1. Statistics without logic is bad and model monitoring provides the logic behind building a challenger model 2. Model monitoring provides details about the drift that occurred, which may be valuable to understand for future analysis, feature engineering, etc\n    submitted by    /u/Captain___Mutato  \n [link]   [comments]",
