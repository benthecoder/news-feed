          "description": "Most people agree that having a whiteboard during a meeting, or having diagrams & charts in a paper is better than not - but I don’t see a lot of discussion about what makes a great diagram / architectural sketch / etc.\nIf reading is the way to become a better writer, I assume that looking at examples of good diagrams is the way to improve how I communicate visually. So let’s share examples of great diagrams about CS, software, hardware, etc and why we think they’re great.\nAlternatively, if there’s a site or book that already has a collection focused on visual explanations of computing concepts that we should know about please share that.\nI think e.g. Tufte’s books are probably required reading along these lines, but they are much more general purpose and I’m curious about great examples in computing.",

Eventually I've come to know of possible degrees like applied math/statistics or CS degrees that allow diverse backgrounds that would still teach me courses heavily involved in Data science.

I took the ML Google Developer Crash Course a year ago, but feel like I lack the numpy/pandas/tensorflow foundation required for a standard data science job (I've been able to rely on SPSS for a few years now)\n Here's an example of qualifications I want to acquire:\n  \nExperience building and testing ML models or building applied multivariate statistical models, particularly for data classification\n Experience with self-supervised and semi-supervised learning.\n Proficiency with Python and/or related analytical programming languages\n Familiarity with Machine Learning and data processing related Python packages such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, or Tensorflow.\n  \nAre there any good courses for learning this niche of data science/programming? Theres so many out there its hard to find the good ones.\n    submitted by    /u/Lintaar  \n [link]   [comments]",

Trying to identify strings (email addresses) with a high degree of similarity. Attempting to use scipy's implementation of hierarchical clustering. To prepare the string data for use with the algorithm I transformed the strings to ascii, and then have tried a few different methods to induce normality (log and boxcox). The issue is I'm losing information through the transformation process so I can't convert the data back to the proper email strings after I've clustered them. \n Any recommendations for how to deal with this problem? Better approaches to solving the overall problem are also very welcome!\n    submitted by    /u/JimBeanery  \n [link]   [comments]",
