During my first year at DoorDash, I followed conventional criteria for how to plan and ship experiments. Following conventions was a mistake that hurt my velocity and impact, since I wanted to execute on ten ideas, but could only focus on two or three. In this blogpost, I cover several approaches for balancing velocity and experimentation confidence. I personally wish there was someone who gave me this advice earlier in my career, so I'm sharing it here in case folks find it useful.\n https://doordash.engineering/2022/11/15/balancing-velocity-and-confidence-in-experimentation/\n    submitted by    /u/Professional-Pain208  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unfortunately due to the timeline it will probably be best to just do the analysis myself. I was asking around for reasonable rates and someone told me $50 an hour is a reasonable rate. To be clear this isn’t a long term project, it’s over the next 1.5 months to conduct some analysis and I estimate will take 15-20 hours in total. What hourly rate would you charge for this analysis.

After having lost 3 family members during covid, including dad, I've been doing a lot of thinking about how life is short and whether it really is worth spending the finite time we have far away from family.\n So, I've been looking for jobs in my home country - but either the pay is too low or I need to migrate to the big cities, which defeats the purpose of staying close to (with) family. Therefore, I'm now thinking of trying my hand at DA/DS/ML/AI consulting service.\n But how do I go about setting it up? I set up multiple gigs in Fiverr, one for each subfield (NLP, CV, ML, etc), but I have so far only received 30-100 page views in 2 weeks, and 0 jobs. I've reduced the price of some of the gigs to as low as $5 (starting price), but even then I've received no paid jobs yet (I've had one guy approach me to help him for free on his project).\n Obviously I lack marketing skills. So, do I need to find a marketing partner or hire someone to do the marketing for me? Is it worth paying Google ads for my Fiverr gigs? Or do I spend some time to create my own consulting website and do paid marketing for that, instead of the Fiverr gigs? If there's anybody here who has successfully set up their DS consulting gigs, any help, guidance and direction from you is much appreciated.\n ​\n All the project names in Fiverr start with \\\"I will\\\" for buyers, but in the seller dashboard \\\"I will\\\" is not shown\n    submitted by    /u/ResearcherNo4728  \n [link]   [comments]",

First of all I have my data sets in CSV tables, and am working with the data in python using PanDas.\n So I have a modest set of data, like 500 data points (16 fields and like 30 uses), across around 90 sets of data. But my data is about users... I am wanting to publish the data, but obviously not have the users be obviously identifiable. My data tends to fall within fairly similar ranges across users.\n I'm wondering if there is a way to like 'jiggle' the data so the values don't actually lineup with any individual users, while preserving as much of the underlying statics (like Mean Deviation, Variance etc, but nothing too complex). The data isn't inherently sensitive in any way, most of it can already be obtained through various means, I just don't particularly want to publish something with all the data in one easy to use format, and have individual users easily identified.\n Edit: so the data is already publicly available, there is nothing actually sensitive about it, it's just a bunch of usage data, nothing a kid with a python script couldn't quickly recreate, or a kid with a spreadsheet and too much free time. 🤣😂 I've done similar things myself before I learnt how a simple script can automagically do in seconds what took me hours while watching TV. \n I'm not actually publishing any directly identifiable data, everything is pseudonyms to the username (and the usernames aren't necessarily identifiable to individuals). I'm just wanting to make the date I publish a tiny bit opaque to the actual reality, I'm probably just being overly sensitive about protecting my users.\n    submitted by    /u/corruptboomerang  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, you don't always have lots of data to train your machine learning algorithm. Which classical machine learning methods work well with little data? I'm thinking of things like KNN, linear regression, support vector machines, random forests etc. Is there a paper that systematically investigates machine learning methods when data are sparse? If not, are there some rules of thumb one can follow?\n    submitted by    /u/invzbl3  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys,\n I'm pretty new here and I'd like to tell you about our open-source project.\n My team and I are interested in the multitude of AI APIs that have emerged on the market in recent years from large cloud providers (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.) but also from AI specialists (OpenAI, DeepL, Assembly AI, etc.) and that allow us to handle specific tasks: image recognition, translation, audio transcription, document parsing, etc.\n We develop an API to rule them all: we standardize competing APIs into a single one so that developers can change providers whenever they want, use several APIs at the same time if needed, combine engines from different providers, etc.\n To be transparent about this standardization, we decided to launch an Open Source version where we display the connectors we created to allow any AI service provider to add its own connector or to allow anyone to use our standardization for free: https://github.com/edenai/edenai-apis/ For those who are interested in these topics, I would love to have your opinion on our project and how to nourish it (please note that at the moment, only members of my team are working on it). As I said at the beginning, it's new for us :)\n Thanks in advance,\n Taha\n PS: If you can star the repo that would be great and would help us a lot!\n    submitted by    /u/Effective-Divide-828  \n [link]   [comments]",
