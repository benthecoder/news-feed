          "description": "Digital Manufacturing (DM) refers to the on-going adoption of smarter, more agile manufacturing processes and cyber-physical systems. This includes modern techniques and technologies such as Additive Manufacturing (AM)/3D printing, as well as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and the broader trend toward Industry 4.0. However, this adoption is not without risks: with a growing complexity and connectivity, so too grows the cyber-physical attack surface. Here, malicious actors might seek to steal sensitive information or sabotage products or production lines, causing financial and reputational loss. Of particular concern are where such malicious attacks may enter the complex supply chains of DM systems as Trojans – malicious modifications that may trigger their payloads at later times or stages of the product lifecycle.\nIn this work, we thus present a comprehensive overview of the threats posed by Trojans in Digital Manufacturing. We cover both hardware and software Trojans which may exist in products or their production and supply lines. From this, we produce a novel taxonomy for classifying and analyzing these threats, and elaborate on how different side channels (e.g. visual, thermal, acoustic, power, and magnetic) may be used to either enhance the impact of a given Trojan or utilized as part of a defensive strategy. Other defenses are also presented – including hardware, web-, and software-related. To conclude, we discuss seven different case studies and elaborate how they fit into our taxonomy. Overall, this paper presents a detailed survey of the Trojan landscape for Digital Manufacturing: threats, defenses, and the importance of implementing secure practices.\narXiv\nComments",

          "description": "Hey HN! Some more info: I’m an NHS doctor and the founder of Pi-A (https://www.pi-a.io) which developed Lungy (https://www.lungy.app). Lungy is an app (iOS only for now) that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It hopefully has many aspects of interest to the HN community – real-time fluid, cloth and soft body sims running on the phone’s GPU.\nMy background is as a junior surgical trainee and I started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London. During COVID, there were huge numbers of patients coming off ventilators and they are often given breathing exercises on a worksheet and disposable plastic devices called incentive spirometers to encourage deep breathing. This is intended to prevent chest infections and strengthen breathing muscles that have weakened. I noticed often the incentive spirometer would sit by the bedside, whilst the patient would be on their phone – this was the spark that lead to Lungy!\nThe visuals are mostly built using Metal, with one or two using SpriteKit. There are 20 to choose from, including boids, cloth sims, fluid sims, a hacky DLA implementation, rigid body + soft body sims. The audio uses AudioKit with a polyphonic synth and a sequencer plays generated notes from a chosen scale (you can mess around with the sequencer and synth in Settings/Create Music).\nThere are obviously lots of breathing and meditation apps out there, I wanted Lungy to be different - it's about tuning into your surroundings and noticing the world around you, so all the visuals are nature-inspired or have some reference to the physical world. I didn’t like other apps required large downloads and/or a wifi connection, so Lungy’s download size is very small (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34534615\nPoints: 394\n# Comments: 148",

I have a EE bachelor's degree, with a minor in statistics. I am trying to make the switch to DS, because the analysis is my favorite part of my job. I live in a medium size city in the SE. I currently make around $80k. most of my coworkers who have quit in recent months are leaving for $90k+ easy. \n I just got off the phone for with a preliminary interview for a small company. I asked for around 90k. They said that was too high. I said I wasn't willing to accept anything less than my current salary. They said 80k was also a bit high, given my level of experience. I feel like I've been bluffed, or maybe the interviewer is just out of touch with inflation trends. She asked to see my last 3 pay stubs as proof of my salary, to justify paying me such a \"high\" salary. \n Is 80k high?? It would essentially be an entry level position, but I still feel like I'm bringing too much to the table, to not expect some bump in pay. \n I'm tempted to continue on with the next rounds of interviews and accept the job, just to get my foot in the door.

It does this fine.\n However, some nuance is then applied via human effort to modify groupings based on some customer notes (a text string) that sometimes dictate that two customers need to be in different groups for x reason, even if the original grouping adheres to the ruleset. \n The application itself has a UI that sorts customers into columns, which are manipulated by staff via dragging and dropping a customer/customers between one column and another. \n I had a thought to employ an AI model that compares the original generated grouping config that our code produces against the modified groupings that staff adjust based on that nuance. The idea is that we could analyze the why of a modification and use that insight to generate better default groupings. \n Is there a model out there that would be ideally suited for this kind of learning? Keen to dive into it further on my own but any recommendations as a starting point would be great.\n    submitted by    /u/premiumnougat  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, there has been a lot of excitement around OpenAI's ChatGPT which generates natural-language responses to human prompts.\n But what if... it's not as amazing as we all think it is?\n Yann LeCun, Meta's chief AI scientist, argues that the program is not innovative. He also states that similar technology has been developed by many companies and research labs, and that ChatGPT is composed of multiple pieces of technology developed over many years by many parties.\n (sounds salty to me... and I like my cookies sweet!)\n But maybe Yann has a point!\n What's happening now? ChatGPT is perceived by many as a unique and innovative program. People are using it everyday to make their lives easier. So, no matter what, ChatGPT is still awesome.\n What's happening next? It's unclear what will happen next in terms of the development and perception of ChatGPT. However, it can be expected that as AI technology continues to evolve, there will be further advancements on what is possible with this tech.\n It's likely that ChatGPT will face many spin-offs and competitors this year.\n If you enjoyed this and want 500+ AI tools, I write a daily AI newsletter: https://chriscookies.beehiiv.com/p/metas-chief-ai-scientist-says-chatgpt-not-innovative-7581\n    submitted by    /u/ZaKodiak  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’ve been an intensive care doctor for 10 years now and I’m looking at making the jump to a career in medical AI. Currently in Australia \n A few questions : 1. I love my clinical job, but there is a strong possibility that a lot of clinicians will be replaced by AI. I would want to be at the forefront of this. I don’t see myself working in a hospital till I die. Plus this is very very exciting!! What do I as a clinician bring to this? Is there even a job opportunity for doctors in this field? Part of me is like “what am I even doing thinking of AI? I don’t belong here”\n  \nI did a basic Coursera course on AI a few months ago, but that was just dipping my toes. How do I start studying this? I have no background in software/ coding, just a very good work ethic and an above average intelligence. Who do I talk to? I obviously need mentors bcos this is completely unfamiliar territory to me.\n  \nAny advice will be useful\n    submitted by    /u/ChanceOk4613  \n [link]   [comments]",
