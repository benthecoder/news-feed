          "description": "So, just to focus this question, I don’t want to touch the subject of password patterns or password generation.  Let’s focus only on “random passwords” (for whatever that means) of a given entropy.  (In other words, let’s assume there is a fool-proof function genpwd(entropy_bits) that generates a password with the given entropy and we’ll just use whatever it spits out.)\nAlso, to focus even more, the intended use-case is for encrypted offline storage (which includes anything from GnuPG keys, Age encrypted files, full-disk-encryption, etc.).\nFurthermore, the only threat we want to protect against is brute-force against the cryptographic primitives.  Furthermore say the attacker has enough hardware power (say a few millions $) and enough patience (say a few years).  And let’s also assume we’ve reached the peak of the technology capabilities (both hardware and software).\n(I am well aware that by now I have waved away so many potential attack vectors that we are currently in the theoretical space…)\nGiven all that, the obvious answer is “just use a password with at least as many entropy bits as the underlying cryptographic construct”.  (For example in the case of something based on AES-128, just use a 128 entropy bits password, passed through an at least 128 bit hash function;  key derivation with iterations isn’t needed.)\nHowever, at the other end there is memorability which pushes the entropy down.  As a user I would prefer to use a short and memorable password (regardless of what that means), which means having fewer entropy bits.\nAnother complication is password derivation functions (like Argon, scrypt, bcrypt, the newer bscrypt, or in the worst case some variant of PBKDF) which helps us gain some entropy bits through time spent.\nSo my question is:  given adequate defaults for a password derivation function, how many bits of entropy do I require for my password to be practically unbreakable in my lifetime (~100 years)?\nIs 64 bits enough?  Is 72 bits enough?  Should I go up to 128 bits?",

Maybe a pessimistic view but Ive just started learning DS and really enjoy it.

The first time after being detected that they enter one of our shop, we greet them in a special manner. Some of those detected are NOT \"activated\" in order to be our control group.\n Now, stakeholders want to know if the model works, meaning if there is a difference between the clients we contacted and the ones in the control group : we shall look at expense, number of visit, etc.\n How would you compare the two groups, knowing that within the group of people who are activated, all of them are at a different date (and I don't want any time effect to pollute the analysis...)\n Any ideas ?

But since anybody with a internet connection and laptop can pretty much learn what I do and get into this industry or data science, I was wondering if this is a good career. Because of lower barrier to entry, it creates more competition.\n For example, in career such as law, doctor ..etc. you need a good degree and few years of training. The cost of these is high and there is a high barrier for entry. One simply cannot become a doctor or a lawyer without having credentials. You cannot become a lawyer by watching youtube tutorials.

My problem is: what is the best way to convert both data records so they can be used for an ml model (I am currently using sklearn.linear_model => LogisticRegression as a machine learning model).

This would be training and evaluating on the same dataset and I'm sure that is wrong.\n I've also seen people train the model with the train data and then forecast X time steps into the future and compare those results with the test set (RMSE, R^2, etc...), but this has the disadvantage that the forecasted values will tend towards the mean, so it's not really a good way to evaluate the model, right?\n Why isn't there a more straight forward way to do this with statsmodels?

And I've worked with both the traditional data scientist CS/Stats background types all the way through to data scientists with bachelors in Art History. The bottom line is that each bring their own unique and very invaluable thinking styles to the field.\n The art historian turned data scientist once proposed an extremely interesting way of organising plots way before sns.pairplot() was a thing, our client LOVED it. Another data scientist who had a background in sociology was able to pull some awesome insights around credit default rates given the average number of letterboxes in a neighbourhood.\n The point is, some of the best DS people I've worked with came from eclectic backgrounds and it's usually those ones that I learn from the most. So if you're thinking about becoming a data scientist, don't be dissuaded by the coding aspect (which can be learned in months). The thinking style you've cultivated takes YEARS to develop.\n ​\n EDIT: a bunch of people have been asking about DS entry programmes. Don't pay for tech skills you can learn for free on youtube.
