          "description": "I am a last year Data Science bachelor student in Europe on track to graduate by June 2023. I believe I have quite a strong profile for grad school applications and will be applying to some top grad schools in Europe/US for a masters in Data Science. I already put in all the effort of gathering letters of recommendation, writing SOPs, taking the GRE, etc... \n For fun I applied to an Uber 6 month internship program and have now progressed to the final round. I will be left with a huge dilemma on what to do if I would actually get offered the role. So it's a full time 6 month internship starting in Jan which will cause me to delay my studies. This also means that my applications for my masters will have to be postponed for a full year and I (feel like I will) lose some of my momentum for my grad school applications as I don't think an Uber internship is really valuable for grad schools applications. Uber did tell me that they're looking to transfer me to a full-time employee after my bachelor's so I could work a bit for them and then go on to do my masters later. Although in the current market I don't know how good my chances for that happening would actually be. \n The money from the internship would be quite a life changer for me but I would hate to see all my work for my grad school applications go to waste and perhaps not have as good chances next year. \n Anyone here who would be able to give some perspective on this and perhaps some advice would be much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Chaos_Theory947  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are plenty of workarounds on the internet, but sometimes those “workarounds” added together make the back end of tableau super messy and super hard to modify/ debug in the future. At my current company, the previous guy basically did what he was asked for, but it takes me weeks just to edit one little thing and I hate it with a passion. When I joined the company, I told them it was my goal to clean it all up and leave it better for me, my coworkers and any future employee to work with. My boss recently asked for another of those requests but I told him I’d rather present it differently than what he is asking for because of those issues. I will always give him the data he needs, but I can’t always present it the way he wants because it makes things “unclean” on the backend. I worked as a software engineer and I’ve always strived for “clean code”, which is the approach I’m trying to use here.

          "description": "From my reading, the supply chain industry has a lot of fully integrated supply chain management solutions. These solution typically have some modules related to data science out of the box. Take for example Kinaxis, which has its Planning.AI within its ecosystem. Others like Blue Yonder, SAP and O9 also feature some readily built-in data science solutions to tackle supply chain problems. \n Sure other industries also have their own popular proprietary solutions bought from the market.\n However, for supply chain specifically, I kinda have the impression that the usage of open source solutions like R/Python/Julia is lesser known. Python has PuLP, R has ROI package and Julia has JuliaOpt. But choosing which one over the other is not always clear. You have more resources online debating the merits of R vs Python, say for deep learning with concrete examples of how they are being used in the industry. \n I just joined the supply chain industry and there is a lot of focus on getting certified on these paid solutions (Kinaxis, Blue Yonder, O9, etc). While the opportunity to learn the proprietary systems is great, I hope to ensure my previously acquired skills in R/Python remain relevant in this industry. For example, previously I used R forecast package to perform demand forecasting. This was because the client was mainly using Excel tool and the SAP system has very basic forecasting feature. \n But now it seems that this proprietary systems are gettibg more sophisticated with the supply chain offering that you can run some level of AI within their integrated systems.\n So how is R/Python being used alongside the proprietary solution in the supply chain industry?\n    submitted by    /u/levenshteinn  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since sophomore year, I have been active in a ML research group and I’m considering in applying to grad school with a focus in AI/ML. Therefore, do the courses that you take as an undergrad, matters a lot in your grad school application? And should I be focusing on taking all AI/ML related courses? \n The problem is, I’ve never really been exposed to other CS fields such as distributed systems, security, graphics, etc. and I am really interested in exposing myself to the them along some more advanced Math topics, but I do not have a lot of electives left to explore as I am also doing a math minor.\n    submitted by    /u/lets_go_neu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I'd like to introduce a semantic segmentation model called RTFormer, which is accepted by NeurIPS 2022. \n Hope this be some help to you.\n RTFormer is an efficient dual-resolution transformer for real-time semantic segmenation, which achieves better trade-off between performance and efficiency than CNN-based models.\n To achieve high inference efficiency on GPU-like devices, RTFormer leverages GPU-Friendly Attention with linear complexity and discards the multi-head mechanism. Besides, cross-resolution attention is more efficient to gather global context information for high-resolution branch by spreading the high level knowledge learned from low-resolution branch.\n Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RTFormer, it achieves state-of-the-art on Cityscapes, CamVid and COCOStuff, and shows promising results on ADE20K.\n Official code is available at: https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg/tree/develop/configs/rtformer\n Arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07124\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/49njwpj9jwz91.png?width=999&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bbeab8943452dab4985ddc8241e98e3c5cf2e36\n    submitted by    /u/Effective_Tax_2096  \n [link]   [comments]",
