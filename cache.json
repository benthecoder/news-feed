By “technical books,” I mean stuff that I could reasonably expense as part of my work’s learning budget. By “timeless,” I mean that they won’t immediately go out of date once the next version of the software is released.",

I talk about how I got burned at the onset of a small project and how I think if I just took a few steps before it would not have snowballed into the mess it is today. My goal is to demonstrate some small practice changes that can hopefully help small teams before they embark on projects for other teams.\nI would love feedback on it!\nComments",

          "description": "I was born in the late 90s so by the time I got involved in technology, my introduction to Unix and Unix-flavored systems was limited to Linux and MacOS. However, I've read about the history of Unix at Bell Labs, the BSD systems derived from research Unix, and the eventual commercial releases of Unix System V from AT&T themselves. I also see that HP-UX, AIX, and Solaris are apparently still maintained and get releases, which suggests that they are still being used in production in some places.\nI'm curious if anyone here currently works (or has very recently worked) somewhere where proprietary Unix is still used for production. If so, can you tell me what they're used for and why those deployments haven't been moved to an appropriate Linux distribution?\nNot suggesting Linux is necessarily better for all use cases, just wondering what keeps these small number of entities clinging to closed-source Unix with presumably pricey license costs.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34017934\nPoints: 68\n# Comments: 57",

          "description": "I have tabular data where each group of 100 rows represents a deployment of a specific geometry that has certain features measured. For example, I have 10000 deployments stored in a column called \"Dep,\" which ranges from 1 to 10000. When fitting this data to an xgboost model, the model may mistakenly assume that the deployment numbers have an ordering relationship (e.g., that deployment 1 is less than deployment 2, which is less than deployment 3, and so on). However, this is not the case because all deployments are independent of each other. On the other hand, if I remove the \"Dep\" column, the model will not be able to differentiate between the different deployment groups and their unique geometries.\n I got the idea of one hot encoding of the column dep, but it's useless as the training dataset has 7000 deployments while the test dataset has 3000. If I do a one hot encoding, the shapes will not match (along with a slew of other issues). Better think of another approach.\n What is the solution to this issue?\n    submitted by    /u/Hamdi_bks  \n [link]   [comments]",

Less features is more in this case so I’m wondering if there is any penalty I can add that is on the same scale as the scoring metric (eg accuracy for classification which ranges from [0,1] or negative mean squared error which goes from (-inf,0]) but based on the number of features. Basically saying “is it really worth it to add this feature?”\n I know there’s L1 and L2 penalty for linear models but I don’t think that applies here because if o square the number of features or something it will be largely out of scale with the scoring metric (eg adding a feature has a positive change in accuracy of 0.3 so let’s keep it, another feature only adds to the accuracy by 0.001 so let’s not add it). \n Any brainstorming on this would be very helpful so don’t hesitate.

So I'm willing to give it a try, but I don't really know where to start. I mean, there are plenty of tutorials available online, but I learn best from doing an actual project and looking stuff up as I go (I'm not interested in doing a course on Udemy or the like because I hate learning from recorded lectures -- especially since I'm doing this for fun, because I like data science, I don't want to force myself to watch a bunch of lectures). So I was thinking I'd find an actual database online with an interesting dataset, pick some project I'd like to do with it, and then find tutorials in to how to use SQL to extract, clean, and manipulate data, and use them as I go. That's pretty much how I've been learning statistical coding in both R and Python. \n The problem is, when I Googled variations of \"publicly available databases\", I just found freely available datasets, the same type of stuff I'd find if I Googled \"free datasets\". I figure there have to be actual databases available to the public, because otherwise how would anyone self-teach SQL, but clearly I'm using the wrong search terms to find them. \n Part of the problem is perhaps that I haven't had a course on what databases even are really -- I just completed a DS minor, but all the projects and assignments we did involved using R and/or Python to read in data from a CSV or XLXS file. I have a general idea of what databases are and I figured I'd learn more about them as I started using SQL (I learned about data cleaning and manipulation almost entirely from doing projects in R) but right now I'm very much a newbie to databases. \n Does anyone have any suggestions for the search terms I should be using to find a database I can use for learning?

Half of the survey's respondents said their business has adopted AI in at least one business area. That's up from 20% of respondents in 2017.\n McKinsey also found that AI is being embedded into a wider range of business capabilities. The average user of AI in business is now using the technology in 3.8 applications, compared to 1.9 in 2018.\n The use of AI in business covers a spectrum of applications, including process automation, digital twins, and facial recognition.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/8ds3zprg7b6a1.png?width=1148&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e05a9f8ded2841eb10462a24dc407b4e91778c5\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/13k5tyyh7b6a1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fbeb7befac49f12d2acbda0626f5676cc9c4845\n ​\n This is from the AI With Vibes Newsletter, read the full issue here: https://aiwithvibes.beehiiv.com/p/ai-porn-billie-eilish-goes-viral-tiktok-chatgpt-brutally-destroyed-pun-competition\n    submitted by    /u/Mk_Makanaki  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A recent article I read discussed the most current AI news. A brand-new AI product on the market is getting a lot of attention. \n ChatGPT is a piece of software that allows people to converse with a computer by typing in a question or task, and the program will create a response that is intended to appear human. We fed it billions of Internet-sourced text samples to train it. Moreover, one of its distinguishing features is its ability to grasp and generate natural language. This indicates that it may answer naturally and conversationally, making it a helpful tool in various settings. \n However, how well the processing technology \"understands\" language is unknown. But still, it is getting people talking. According to the researchers, \"you can have what looks dangerously similar to a human dialogue with it.\" ChatGPT has grown in popularity as a result of its ease of use. It has only been open to the public for 11 days, yet it already has over a million users, making it more popular than Facebook in less time. \n Although, it faces challenges that even the company behind it admits, such as a proclivity to make \"nonsense\" as it advances. \n Please let me know if you have any recommendations or believe this topic might interest you. https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-1.6681401\n    submitted by    /u/ricks_cloud  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm almost certain this is already an idea someone thought of, but I had to write it out here anyways, just in case. I think a super interesting use for AI voice generation/cloning of someone else's voice could be to generate the vocal audio for movies, in different languages. This could also probably apply to the video too, since that's possible now also. I think real acting and vocals are the way to go first, but I think this could also be a great fill-in if the actor doesn't know different languages, or if the movie is under too low of a budget to record in different languages. Then you get the actor's same exact voice, but in different languages! Sounds surreal, and super cool. There's a lot more CGI in movies nowadays, and that has become the norm, so I imagine this could have a similar outcome if it started to happen more and more (relating this to CGI, from feeling foreign to becoming more popular and part of the norm). What's your thoughts? Not sure if I like it, but I do like it as an idea at least 😆\n Edit: Inspired from the Tailosive Tech live stream, when Drew and his dad were talking about Star Trek https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SZikYMGEXe4\n    submitted by    /u/Offroaders123  \n [link]   [comments]",
