In contrast to all existing approaches, it unclutters articles by modifying their CSS instead of extracting the text content.\nThis results in a more visually pleasing result that reuses the original article style. The idea is to remove friction so you use the reader mode more often.\nThere are a few more features around saving articles automatically and taking highlights -- more details are on the website.\nThe extension has about 400 active weekly users right now, mostly from organic web store traffic. Monetisation has proven to be hard and for freemium there would need to be much higher numbers anyways.\nDo you think I should keep working on the project?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33718850\nPoints: 104\n# Comments: 51",

          "description": "Hi All,\n I am an intermediate statistics student currently working on a project which involves analysis of likert scale data(range 1-5, 1 being \"Completely Disagree or Least Likely). The dataset contains a few other customer specific information like race, gender, age, location, income group etc. The remaining columns are the responses of customers to a survey questionnaire in 1-5 likert scale. There are total 25 questions and therefore 25 likert columns. \n The end objective is to understand customers attitude towards a product , based on survey responses. 1.How do I go about modelling such a project? Someone in my group suggested using hierarchical models ( not sure weather the frequentist or Bayesian hierarchical model). What would be the response variable in this case, since I have 25 likert columns that could be treated as the response variable. 2. How do I measure the effect of one variable (say income group) on the customers attitude towards the product? I have already performed clustering techniques to segment the customers and develop a profile. I have also performed Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney U test to see if there exists a difference in attitude based on income group for each survey response.\n  \nIf I decide to model using Bayesian hierarchical model, how would I choose a prior for the likert data points? One likelihood that comes to mind is Xij-1~Binomial(4,pj) where Xij is the survey response of the ith customer for the jth question and pj is the prior parameter for jth question. However, I don't think this would be correct as pj will lose its interpretability. Is there any other way I can specify a likelihood and a prior?\n  \nAny help in this regard will be appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/kwisatch  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, I’ll try to keep this post as short as possible. Basically deciding between two Data Scientist job offers and having trouble evaluating which will be best for my near and long term future. \n A little info about me: graduated with a undergraduate degree in Econ/stats and worked for about 2 years for a mid sized CPG company as a data analyst for a little under 2 years. Spent the past two years completing a masters in data science at Northwestern University (had the option of doing part time but I decided to quit my job and do full time to really focus on the subject). \n My goal was to break into tech but my graduation perfectly lined up with the tech industry turning into a complete dumpster fire right now, so I barely got so much as a call back from most of my target companies. \n I am currently deciding between two job offers: one at a consulting firm as a data scientist for their banking risk group and the other as a supply chain data scientist for a large healthcare/medical devices company. In my opinion, the consulting firm is extremely lowballing me (88K) while the healthcare company surprisingly exceeded my expectations (110K-120K) in terms of salary. I am currently in the process of seeing if the consulting firm can raise the salary because I do believe it is a better job in terms of the requirements and how it will look on my resume. \n I just wanted to get some fellow data scientists’ opinions on a few things: \n  \nIs the consulting firm really lowballing me or is this a reasonable salary?\n \nIf my eventual goal is to break into tech (FAANG), will one of these experiences look better than the other? \n \nGiven I’m currently unemployed, paid about 60K for the masters, and was making 70-75K at my job pre masters, what would be a “reasonable” salary to ask for?\n \n    submitted by    /u/Famous_Telephone6924  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "One of the important but often forgotten parts of building a good classification model is probability calibration. \n Imagine you’re building a churn model. \n To make optimal business decisions based on the output of your model you’d like to know now only whether the prediction is positive or negative, but only what’s the probability of a user churning. Based on that probability (and a couple other things) you can weigh the cost of retention actions vs expected gain for example. \n You can use model scores (what you get when you run .predict_proba in sklearn). Contrary to the method name, these scores are actually not probabilities unfortunately. \n These scores would be probabilities if a probability of 20% would turn out the be positive 20% of the time model returns that probability. \n However, most of the ML algorithms that are able to capture non-linear relationships, also tend to return scores that are not probabilities (as in the picture in calibration plots). \n Fortunately, there’s a way to post-process the scores to turn them into probabilities. \n Long story short, we can simply fit a function that will straighten the calibration curve after we create it by binning model scores and calculating the fraction of positives for every bin. There’s of course a bit more nuance to probability calibration, but this post is already too long 😅. \n Then we add this simple regressor at the end of our prediction pipeline and instead of getting just the model scores, we’ll get properly calibrated probabilities. \n https://preview.redd.it/ut784btrvq1a1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea6bd22aec54a4d0747d7b43e692d43ea1ea06d7\n    submitted by    /u/mlbbysitter  \n [link]   [comments]",
