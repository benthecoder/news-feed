          "description": "I wanted to see how difficult it would be to build a web app using a sub-$300 android smartphone. Decided to build a fun predictions website where you could bet virtual (not real) money on predictions made by others, and also make predictions of your own.\nBuilding it turned out to be considerably easier and more fun than I anticipated.\nPrimary tools used were:\n# QuickEdit as the mobile code editor (Note: the free version of the QuickEdit app is riddled with ads, it shows an advert each time you close a tab, but it unfortunately had the best UI of the 3 or so Android code editors I tested. Ended up using NetGuard to block it from retrieving & displaying ads),\n# PHP for the Backend ( custom PHP microframework I've used and built on over the past few years ).\n# jQuery for the frontend js (cringing) - it appears I'm simply too lazy to learn React/Vue/et al. Every once in a while, I pick one of them to learn, but I always end up returning to jQuery - or time-permitting - amateur level vanilla JS.\n# Bootstrap for the CSS - Battle-tested. For a purely backend dev with minimal design skills, good ol' Bootstrap (and in a growing number of cases, Tailwind) is always a life saver.\n# Whole thing is hosted on 2 VMs (1 hosting the web app, and 1 hosting Redis & MySQL).\n# As to the site itself, it turned out to be pretty cool to play around with. Go there, view the predictions, bet on the predictions you believe will come true, or against the ones you think will not. You get $50,000 to bet with (not real money). No signup is required to bet, but a quick signup is required to make a prediction. Hope you guys like it, and please be ruthless in telling me of any bugs you've found.\nSo go on here => kudotap.com\nAnd Have Fun!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33736245\nPoints: 75\n# Comments: 31",

The quality of computer-generated visuals, such as portraits, pet shots, videos, essays, and works of art, has grown on us. GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, Polycode, and more tools have taken the next logical step by augmenting the present code autocomplete capability with #AI.\n As a result, #artificial intelligence (AI) and #machine learning (ML) have been gradually introduced into software development. Unlike cat pictures, however, research shows that there is a real risk connected with the origin, quality, and security of application code.\n Copilot's autocompletion, for example, is trained on open-source code to provide relevant snippets. This makes the quality and security of suggestions contingent on the training set. The greater concern is with AI-generated software code, not with Copilot. Similar generators are likely to gain popularity in the coming years. The computer industry must consider how such code is created, how it is used, and who is held accountable when things go wrong.\n If you have any thoughts on the subject and believe it will benefit your organization, please share them with me.\n https://www.darkreading.com/edge-articles/ai-generated-code-is-coming-are-you-ready-\n    submitted by    /u/ricks_cloud  \n [link]   [comments]",
