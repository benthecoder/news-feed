I searched on google a little bit but it doesn’t get clear for me. \n I thought that we need a holdout set when we do predictions and based on these predictions we start doing something. For example „churn“ and „no churn“. When our model predicts a churn of a customer and we start to take action against that. Maybe the customer will not churn. This leads to the case that the prediction would be correct but with our effort we turned the decision of the customer to no churn. In such cases a hold out set would be useful. If we don’t have a case like this and our actions have no impact on the predicted task, do we need a holdout set?\n    submitted by    /u/kongg18  \n [link]   [comments]",
