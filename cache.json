We're starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.\nHow it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.\nWe are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor and Google. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (C…",

Looking at the function documentation, it said the same thing. And when I tried using it on my data, sure enough, the error rate decreased significantly.

Sadly, some people have nobody...I'm making these videos for them.\n The premise of the channel is simple. I'm asking 100 data scientists questions about their journey (tips, mistakes, challenges, etc) and then turning those questions into YouTube videos. \n Here's an example: \"100 Data Scientists Reveal Common Newbie Mistakes\" OR \"100 Data Scientists Share Their #1 Interview Tip\"\n There's a lot of data science-related content out there, but there's nothing like this.\n Many new learners are lost and could really use your help. So if you're a data scientist and have 20-30 minutes to spare, I'd love to ask you a few questions via a Zoom call. \n Thanks so much!\n p.s. When I say 100, I really mean it. I have roughly 17 interviews scheduled this last week by reaching out to people on LinkedIn. But I still got a ways to go! So if you know anybody you think would love to help, please share this with them!\n p.p.s I will also be interviewing data engineers and data analysts, but I won't be doing those for another few months.\n    submitted by    /u/JohnDS1503  \n [link]   [comments]",

That this is not scalable and we should find another way.\n Has anyone else been confronted with this? How do you handle in changing environment issues like this.

My schooling was a little weird, but basically I had to supplement my degree with a lot of extra learning (books, Udemy, Youtube, projects) to even get a job as a Support Analyst at a tech company, move over to Data Analyst, interview elsewhere, and get the job I have now. Between grinding at that, and school, I spent 3-4 years going hard at learning, but it was always the “basics”. Right now I’d say I’m really good at SQL, proficient at Python/R for basic analysis, and pretty good at Tableau.\n The role I’m in now has shifted recently to be very administrative. Without getting into too much detail, the company I accepted a job with earlier this year had some data issues, so I have spent a lot of time emailing people, in meetings, updating their database, and working in Excel. I feel like I’m losing my skills, so I want to work on projects or courses or books outside of work, to stay sharp.\n The problem is, my job is boring. I don’t like it, but it’s a lot of busy work, so I’m burning out fast. The day ends and I don’t want to sit and learn and code, I want to have dinner, walk my dog, and watch TV or see friends or play video games.

          "description": "Hello! I was recently promoted to manage a newly established data science team and need a solution that doesn’t add more pain than it’s worth.\n This is a new team full of 15ish people who mostly have not worked together. I’d like some way to display (to myself and the team) what people are working on and how each person’s contributions intersect. Ideally this would look like some kind of Trello-meets-flowchart where I can see what’s going on, what resources are in play and how it all relates.\n Does this exist? What are best practices you guys have seen for getting a big picture overview of the mechanics/assets in play with your team?\n    submitted by    /u/United-Albatros  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Some investors are likening generative AI to the early days of the web, seeing it as a transformative platform shift. US-based VC firm Sequoia sees generative AI as a technology that could generate trillions of dollars of economic value. As the demand for AI-powered content generation accelerates, generative AI start-ups have been garnering significant VC attention despite a broader slowdown in the pace of VC funding. Jasper, an Austin-based start-up, recently raised $125 million in Series A funding at a $1.5 billion valuation. London-based Stability AI also raised $101 million in an oversubscribed round, with investors like Coatue and Lightspeed Venture Partners participating. In May, Hugging Face also raised $100 million in a Series C round at a valuation of $2 billion. \n The backing from big is another stamp of approval for generative AI start-ups. Microsoft has made significant investments in OpenAI and is anticipated to enhance its OpenAI efforts this year. Additionally, Google and Meta developed a new artificial intelligence tool to produce a video from a simple text prompt. Such interest from big tech could also very well spark a wave of M&A in the generative AI space. \n Even if generative AI output can’t yet match the human-generated output, businesses and creators see them as handy tools in a broader toolbox. Further, a large number of firms are using generative AI to improve efficiencies and speed in their operations, providing value for their customers. That said, businesses need to address ethical concerns, which are often associated with AI. \n Read on...\n    submitted by    /u/Sienna_99  \n [link]   [comments]",
