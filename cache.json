          "description": "Cofounder of Obsidian here. We're excited to announce Obsidian 1.0 is live!\nObsidian 1.0 introduces two big changes: a UI overhaul and an new tabbed interface. We've put a lot of care into making the app more approachable and more accessible. We've also prioritized using more native OS features for menus, windows, and many details.\nWe got our first private beta users from a comment under a HN thread about org-roam [1], and our waiting list was an innocent Google Form. Good times!\nOur initial launch on HN was over two years ago [2], when terms like \"second brain\" and \"tools for thought\" were still in their infancy. Since then, the landscape has continued to evolve and new ideas are sprouting in the space every day. Obsidian has always embraced its \"hacker\" nature and thrives off its community of tinkerers. We now have over 670 plugins that push the envelope of what's possible in the app.\nWe want to continue to foster that same hacker spirit, but at the same time, we want to provide a polished product that can stand on its own. In the last several months, we've expanded the team and refocused ourselves on providing a product that's polished and easy to use.\nWe have big plans to continue making Obsidian the best and most refined thought-processing app for decades to come. Obsidian 1.0 is just the start!\nSpecial credits go to Stephan Ango (@kepano) for the redesign and Liam Cain for tirelessly polishing this release.\n[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22767658\n[2]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23324598\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33190433\nPoints: 1068\n# Comments: 481",

          "description": "Alright, so I haven't commented/posted here but been seeing posts and been wondering something. I just got my first \"data\" job as a Senior Data Analyst maybe 6 months ago, with years of experience in analytics, excel and then taking courses in SQL/Tableau. I know some html/css so I've been able to fix/update some Python code but need to just take a course on it and was trying to start by maybe the end of this month. \n The thing I'm wondering is, if a recession is coming/a good bit of layoffs....how safe do you think data related jobs will be overall? Lots of layoffs, just depends on the company/industry/what you're working, or maybe less since data can be pivotal/provide extremely valuable BI or other information? Will there still be a good bit of openings or will it really slim down? \n I'm just curious whether people here think data skills will be more valuable in a recession type of job marketing/there will be more opportunities for those in data science or no?\n I'm also wondering because I oriented into this field as a way to make better money than digital marketing, let alone get out of paid media. My goal was to be able to get to 6 figures or so and in just the last two weeks I've had two companies contact me about salaries closer to that (so I'm curious if I jump for the better paying job, could I screw myself if the company let me go in like 6 months if a recession hits and then the job market isn't as good for my skills then/I should have maybe just stayed in my current job). \n Tl dr: How would data science jobs/openings fair if a recession/massive layoffs hit in like 6 months?\n    submitted by    /u/WhatsTheAnswerDude  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello there! The past few months I’ve been building Credit Risk Models, aimed at scoring borrowers. It’s been quiet the ride. I’ve primarily only used Logistic regression with a variety of feature selection algorithms and data prep algorithms.\n Feature selection algorithms range from p-tests and f-tests to RFE and WoE/IV based binning. I have not been able to find any other literature around Model building and seem stuck within these methods confined to just fine tuning parameters and of course spend tonnes of time in ensuring data integrity (which is obviously important)\n Do you guys have any specific hacks or tips around this subject ? Ways of getting a better AUC. Am not quiet happy at 0.85\n Why ? because the confusion matrix essentially puts me in a position where the org would just have to bear a small amount of loss (within reasonable levels) so as to not loose out on customers (high precision, low recall) but also considerable number of False Positives.\n We’ve been testing outcomes and the results look promising but the sample isn’t large enough to be entirely sure. So I want to upgrade what we have in the meantime and have that score out some borrowers too, including the ones we’ve already done so that months down the lane I can compare the outcomes.\n Any help, direction, links to material, etc will be super helpful.\n P.S : we have a challenger XGBoost model, this is the one at 0.85. With Logistic models I’ve only really touched 0.78 in AUC.\n    submitted by    /u/algobaba  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've cleaned the data and removed the highly correlated columns(Threshold =0.95). But, some of the remaining fields seem extremely skewed(above abs(2)). The next logical steps would be to apply transformation to reduce skewness but the values of these fields seem to be ranging from 0.7 to 0.9. Any Transformations do not seem to unskew the data(Even after shifting the origin technique). I tried the applying transformation after MinMaxScaling and it seems to be working fine for me but this approach doesn't seem very intuitive. Need help moving forward.\n PS: I am still a beginner.

          "description": "Looking for advice, thanks for reading!\n For context, I have been working in a data science position for ~1.5 years now within the same company, and am exiting the junior status. I'm the only one in this company that could call himself a data scientist, so I dont have many people here I can talk about this situation with.\n I feel like they have treated me well during this time, and have bumped my salary quite significatively during my 1 year review. Next review I will be pushing for a salary that takes into account that I no longer am a junior at my role.\n A rough summary of my role : We make POCs and evaluate the value it would deliver in production, and help in implementing into production. So lately, we have successfully pushed projects based on my POCs to government funding. Those grants can be huge, covering almost 50% of total expenses, with a very high maximum grant ceiling. e.g. : https://www.scaleai.ca/\n In these, there is price gouging everywhere, the most obvious is the consultancy services, which are charging a whopping 200$ per hour on average for all their available roles, which is almost 5 times my current salary. I feel like they know the grants are generous, and are charging extravagant prices because the genrous grants will help cover those salaries anyway.\n Obviously, I'm a bit jealous, because I feel like I don't get a fair share of the pie in this deal. My company wants to develop a certain level of expertise in data science, but are throwing all the grant money at consultants and leaving a lot less for actual employees.\n I'm just a bit dumbfounded and want people to talk to. I love where I work, but after seeing those numbers I feel somewhat disrespected, yet don't know if I should.

And honestly, what a model really is.\n As I understand it, training data is fed to a system with an algorithm and the system utilizes that to create a model.

          "description": "It was midnight. I woke up to the fire alarm going off. I rushed downstairs, and found out that the kitchen was on fire. I had left on the stove for too long. I quickly called 911, but then, I made a horrible realization. I could see smoke in the bathroom. That’s when I knew I couldn’t call 911.\n I dashed into the bathroom, and extinguished the fire with the curtain. I began to cry, and I could feel my heart beating very fast. My heart was pounding like crazy. I stood there for a moment, staring at the fire. But then I saw something. A small red blob on the wall. It was coming from the vent. I opened it, and a rush of smoke came out.\n I tried to put out the fire. At first, I was able to, but soon, it was on me. The smoke was getting more intense, and I began to cough. I had no way to get out. I could feel my throat burning. The fire was spreading fast, and it was getting harder to breathe.\n I kept coughing, but the smoke wouldn’t go out. The only way out was through the vent. I sucked in as much as I could, and then let the vent back out. The only thing I was thinking about was my mother. I didn’t want her to worry.\n Finally, the smoke went out, and I could breathe again. I went back to the kitchen, and I looked at the damage. The cabinets were burned, and the stove was melted. I just sat there for a moment, thinking about what to do next. When I realized that it wasn’t going to fix itself, I grabbed a flashlight, and a bag. I headed out the back door, and took a chance that I wouldn’t get lost.\n I walked for hours. At some point, I heard cars passing. I knew I had to walk far enough that they wouldn’t find me. I remember passing a turn off, and I knew I had to turn around.\n When I got home, I headed straight to my mother. She asked me where I had been, and why I wasn’t in my room. I told her the truth.\n    submitted by    /u/Ordinary-Pool6007  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've tried topaz's artemis algorithm and waifu2x's 2d and 3d algorithm. So far, topaz's artemis algorithm produces the best results, however its smudging and cleanliness is deemed rather uncanny for some. Meanwhile waifu2x's algorithms are not trained for natural looking objects which causes the output video to have a lot of artifacts. Are there any other algorithms available that are more trained and more advanced than these algorithms?\n    submitted by    /u/mega_lova_nia  \n [link]   [comments]",

My interest revolves exclusively around creating new content for video games.\n The main thing I'm curious about is how evolved the tech is at this point in time. As I understand it, you can create semi-convincing audio if you have a decent dataset available. But if my aim is to create audio that is indistinguishable from source material, what would stand in my way? Is it a matter of current methods being reliant on datasets, or the tech still being underdeveloped?\n    submitted by    /u/Aigalian  \n [link]   [comments]",
