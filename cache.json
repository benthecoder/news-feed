Our goal is to lower the TTV for our users.\n We are seeing TTV ranges from 2 minutes to 15+ days, and this is not unexpected. It's long tail data, heavily clustered in the 10-20 minutes zone, and then slowly tapering off. \n The mean or median alone doesn't really tell us anything, because the data is so long tailed.\n What metric can I use that will show if we are improving? I thought the mode and the interquartile range could work. A decrease in the mode would show that we are decreasing the hump of the tail, and a decrease in the IQR would show that the spread is also decreasing. (I chose the mode because it is typically the smallest value in a left tail distribution; all of the numbers are long decimals, so I'll probably need to round them.) \n Anyone have better ideas?

The task we have is to find an algo that can outperform this.\n Now I walk into a discussion and see that people are using the good/bad labels for the current algo as the ground truth to compare many other algos from pyOD. I see a bunch of ROC curves for all of these models. And talk about one model is better than another...\n Now I ask what is the performance of the current running algorithm? And how do we compare to that? I get pushback on how it isn't possible to quantify that and that ground truth is subjective.... However I am saying how can any new model outperform the existing one if the existing one is perfect, they say it isnt perfect but just use it for labeling...\n It is hard to convince them that we need to get manual labels to quantify the current model, then we can see if anything useful can be detected beyond that. I feel like nobody understands the issue and I would like to convince them that their approach doesn't make sense. Or am I missing something? Is it not valid to use one algo as ground truth to compare algos?\n Seems suspicious...

It is an automated tool for data scientists, data science students, and data analysts, and generates visualizations on-flight.\n Our GitHub: https://github.com/Kanaries/Rath\n So what is RATH, anyway? It is an open-sourced Tableau, to summarize it a little bit. You do not need sound programming experience to get on hand with it. Fun fact: You can embed this Tableau-like module into your own apps with ease! Check it out here: https://github.com/Kanaries/graphic-walker\n RATH is more than just Tableau. It is designed as a \"copilot\" for data scientists. For most of the people working in this field, you probably already have an established workflow that you do not want to disturb. Good. That's also what we thought. What RATH can do is, RATH automatically generates visualizations and recommendations, which could help, or guide you to explore your data and boost your efficiency. It is like a helper sitting next to you, helping you go through your datasets and giving you ideas in real-time, without disturbing your workflow.\n We are also working on many other creative features! One of the features is called: Data Painter, which allows you to explore your database in an interface similar to Microsoft Painter. You can select, edit, clean, and explore your data using the paint tool and eraser tool. We have a video here to demonstrate these features more visually: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djqePNyhz7w\n If you find our project interesting or have any other thoughts or suggestions, don't be hesitated to ask!

The papers has differences in base models (I am reading DNN/MLP, Autoencoder and Attentive models based), but the task is the same - replace the way to factorize the matrix to find the latent feature vectors of users/items/social relations, only some papers introduce custom loss function with regularisation terms (just to model the social network I would say).

They undermine confidence in ourselves, our leadership, and our organizations. They threaten the status quo. And they have the potential to compromise team dynamics and business results.\n The biggest problem with resignations is that they are supposedly unpredictable. There is no way any manager can predict with some degree of accuracy when an employee will quit.\n Now things will change with AI.\n IBM has created a new AI system that can predict with 95% accuracy which workers are about to quit their jobs. It is called the \"predictive attrition program,\" which was developed with IBM Watson software to predict employee flight risk and prescribe actions for managers to engage employees.\n As IBM CEO Gini Rometty said,\n  \n“It took time to convince company management it was accurate and, so far, it has saved IBM nearly $300 million in retention costs.”\n  \nFurther, Rometty claimed that the AI system could zero in on an individual's strengths. In turn, this can enable a manager to direct an employee to future opportunities they may not have seen using traditional methods. This will also help employees develop future skills and prevent getting redundant.\n All this is wonderful. But a pertinent question remains unanswered.\n Why do we need to run a sophisticated prediction analysis program on our employees to gauge which ones will leave? We are all humans, after all. Do we need a machine to find out if we are unhappy?\n The short answer is No. While AI will give the numbers and dates, it cannot be a one-stop solution to address the inherent problem of an employee quitting the organization. In fact, it can aggravate the problem if used indiscriminately.\n Read more...\n https://discover.hubpages.com/technology/3-Disadvantages-of-Using-Artificial-Intelligence-to-Reduce-Employee-Attrition\n    submitted by    /u/IcyCartoonist1955  \n [link]   [comments]",
