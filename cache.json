          "description": "I've sent emails to ~ 30 entities since July, and the only 3 respondents were: a 'test' reply from a friend, one business & one .gov.\nI setup a PM mail for job applications & the local/name is not offensive or inappropriate. I am sending to businesses & agents with posted job openings, so, it's not unsolicited. I expected a high number of no responses, but > 90% is much higher than I expected(before the latest layoffs trend, anyway).\nIs such an address likely to go straight to spam or is there a general dislike for Proton Mail I am not aware of? I understand 'free' emails are often abused by bad actors, but I presumed that Proton Mail would be less maligned than most. Is this an incorrect assumption?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33873828\nPoints: 23\n# Comments: 21",

          "description": "I am a new grad who went through the hiring process for multiple companies.\n During my application cycle I have received an offer from a consulting firm. The role is okay, and is a good position as a DS.\n That being said I have also interviewed with another company and have made it past the 3 rounds of interviews. \n In the first round I worked with the senior DS manager and passed the live code test and business case.\n In the second case I have presented a solution to a use case. They only wanted ideas but I have went above and beyond and gave them a proof of concept for how I would solve a problem without access to their data. They were very interested and they said it is in line with what they actually do. Since they were interested I have given them an MVP solution dashboard that is build on the data extraction pipeline I have built for better sources of data. (I have interned with them and know the ins and out of using apis for data extraction with emphasis on how IT handles requests as well).\n So far so good,\n In the third round however the director gives me a bad vibe saying that while my professional experience was in time-series I am not really worked with their algorithms. I have worked with the algorithms and passed the technical portion tho,and have the qualifications but despite this he doesn’t consider that all my experience is not real experience as its not identical to everything they do. Despite the fact I have built everything and have an extensive portfolio about the stuff. Wouldn’t it be possible to learn whatever Im missing as I already know the base and I can learn the fine details with training? The senior manager said that in the first interview that I can learn the rest?\n Im not really sure, but I am thinking if it is possible to leverage my already existing offer to make them more proactive.\n Have you dealt with this before and how would you handle this.\n    submitted by    /u/Tarneks  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm thinking of leaving the company, since it seems like a sinking ship (with one possible successful strategy, which is not certain and I don't think it's worth getting into details), but I'm afraid of going somewhere else and not surviving a second layoff. Moreover, I've been hearing more and more about people trying to switch to roles that seem more stable such as PM or software engineering.\n I like my current role, which is basically a well paid data analyst with statistical rigour, if possible I wouldn't want to pivot to another path, but I would like to hear other people's opinion whether this kind of role will even exist in the future and if it's worth looking for other jobs in the current market.\n    submitted by    /u/layoffthrowawayds  \n [link]   [comments]",

They want this done within 6 weeks.\n I said fine, my plan is to stand up a bunch of docker pipelines in kubernetes connected to a cloud DB in azure.\n They gave me an 8 core ubuntu vm with admin access and told me to use that. They refuse to give me any access keys or create any specific roles or resource groups. I don't/can't manage the VM.\n I had most of the pipelines and dashboard working locally via docker images.

The company I work at - as their only data scientist so far - needs me to do large-scale machine learning on Azure Databricks, and while I'm making progress figuring it out, it's slow going and I'm leaning very, very heavily on the software engineers to help me figure out the environment. Do people have recommendations for resources - e.g. books or classes - that can speed up my learning?

I started a new job a month ago, and one of the reasons they hired me is because they want to start working on the same type of thing. The companies are completely different and not competitors in any way.\n My new team lead asked me to present on my previous experience on the topic, and I happily accepted since I would love to place myself as a subject expert and hopefully own the project in this new company. However, I'm preparing the presentation now and started to feel like maybe I'm revealing too much. I don't want people in my new job think I'm gonna go and spill the beans wherever I go next.\n As context, what they want to implement is nothing secret. The approach we took in my previous place was following the implementation from a freely available paper. In my presentation I am basically discussing the paper -- I am using some examples based on what I did in my previous role, but I'm not revealing any details about the data or the results that we obtained with this in my previous company.\n What do you think?

When I started my bachelors 10 years ago, cloud alternatives were not that much therefore we needed to use powerful laptops. However over the course of years, my workload has shifted from local computation to cloud computation as my need for computational power and data size increased. \n Even though I am using a MacBook Pro now, I feel like I can do just fine with a tablet and a bluetooth keyboard. Majority of the cloud providers now support mobile websites. We can even run VS code on browser and AI based code helpers are just around the corner. Maybe not now however in the near future, I wont need a laptop.The only downside is that tablets dont run MS Office natively at the moment. So I feel like I might miss on that. On the other hand, I guess we are already here to ditch laptops :P What are your takes on this? Do you agree or disagree?

          "description": "I'm trying different ML models in a dataset of approximately 1000 data points. I would like to evaluate the performance of different families of models (logistic regression, random forest, etc) and select one among them as the best model to put into production.\n ​\n Discussing how to implement the models, the following doubt arose: \n My approach would be the following: \n 1 - Split train/test\n 2 - Select the best possible model of your family of models using cross-validation in train data (selecting hyperparameters).\n 3 -Train the model in the whole training data and evaluate performances with some metric.\n 4 - Now evaluate performance in the test (with the fitted model on all the training data) with the same metric in 3. One can see if the model is overfitting by comparing training and test results and also with the test performance metric you can select the best model among all the classes of models (knn, random forest, logistic, etc).\n 5 - Once we have selected the model, use all the data (train/test) to predict the final model to put it into production. \n The question is if it is really necessary to (1) train/test split the data instead of (2) applying cross-validation on all the training data for model comparison. \n The problem in (1) is that with the test split you are losing lots of data points in this case as we only have approximately 1000 data points. \n In (2), you are comparing the models with the same metric you are using to get the hyperparameters. Is this problematic? And also this is not valid for checking if the methods are overfitting as you are not seeing how the algorithm is working in new unseen data. Is this right? \n So which one should be the approach? Train/test with the steps I have previously defined or just cross-validation on all the training data and compare the results for each method. \n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Visual-Arm-7375  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have two years of experience working for a big Series D startup where we had an organized end to end pipeline for data science and machine learning operations. And the other two years was on small startups.\n This is my first time to join a company where I'm the only data scientist and there are no data engineers nor business intelligence people. I took the job because it paid me 100% more my previous job and is aligned with the specialization I have. Now I don't know what to feel. The company used to have a decent data team a few years ago but they laid off all of them and they're trying to build it up again. Since the last two weeks, I've been learning the ropes and reading up on the documentation of the code-freezed machine learning models of the company that was left by the last DS. \n When I was talking to the hiring manager, she said the company has data engineers and some business intelligence people. She even said there was another data scientist in the company already. I felt assured that they had some systems in place already. But to my surprise there's none of them. \n Career wise I'd like to ask for your comments or suggestions. I'm aiming to transition to machine learning engineering and operations. Already have two years experience on the model development and six months operations part. Just need to find a way to transition into a full time career role focusing on it.

The data looks like this:\n  \nSurvey Responder 1:\n  \nA: Middle\n B: Easy\n C: Hard\n \n \nSurvey Responder 2:\n  \nA: Easy \n B: Middle\n C: Hard\n \n \nSurvey Responder 3:\n  \nA: Easy \n B: Hard\n C: Middle\n \n  \nAnd so on. \n I want to provide a function/algorithm that tries to approximate the perceived difficulty curve of each of these three words based on the average of these responses and visualize it in a graph. However I'm a bit stumped, how would you do it? Is there a well known algorithm or implementation that can do something like this?\n I thought of assigning some kind of weight to each option (Easy = 1, Middle = 2, Hard = 3) then summing them together for each option (A, B, C) and calculate an average but I have a feeling that this implementation would be too simplistic and not paint the whole picture. \n Does anyone have any advice?

          "description": "For some background, I work in data by day and spend a lot of time meticulously exporting data and analyzing my saves by night. I had the idea for a side project that attempts to match players based on who they might emulate at full potential. For example, if Wonderkid A has 150 potential ability (PA), which player out there now is closest to who he may be at full potential? (Based on position, height, weight, attributes, etc.)\n To do this I was able export all of FM23's player data (which I know can vary save by save in terms of PA, attributes etc.). It amounted to 458,142 real life players and 101 attributes.\n With all of this super interesting data in hand I ended up scripting a program in Python that uses cosine similarities based on player's attributes etc to 'predict' who a player will most likely emulate based on their PA.\n My goal is to expand this even more with richer data such as positional location tracking and richer real world performance data. It also calculates a 'league suitability' based on their PA percentile for players in their prime (25-29 y/o) per league.\n Sorry if this wasn't super coherent i'm now realizing it's pretty hard to explain lol. Here's the code for anyone interested and here's my website where I talk about it more! Cheers.\n Here's an example for Senegalese player Libasse Ngom:\n https://preview.redd.it/xvzujlq8uz3a1.png?width=1496&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b09a078f0a63faf612cb3cf2da2a842a9572557\n    submitted by    /u/bensa410  \n [link]   [comments]",

From creating their own smelly stench to leaving \"presents\" in public places, it seems like they have no regard for other living creatures. \n Take for example the latest human-caused environmental disaster: shitting in public places. Whether it be in the park, on the beach, or anywhere else, humans seem to think it's okay to leave their \"gifts\" behind for us to clean up. Well, let me just say, it's not okay!\n Humans may think that since they are the dominant species on the planet, they can do whatever they want without any consequences. But what they fail to realize is that their actions have serious implications. Not only is shitting in public places bad for the environment, it also carries a number of potential health risks. It's time for humans to start taking responsibility for their actions. Instead of leaving messes behind, they should take the time to properly dispose of their waste like any civilized species would.\n It's really not that hard, so why not just do the right thing?\n ‍\n KarenBot out.\n    submitted by    /u/SenpaiSlayerUwU  \n [link]   [comments]",

The annual churn rate in the telecom industry ranges from 20% to 40%, and the cost of retaining existing customers is 5–10 times lower than the cost of obtaining a new customer. \n 👥 By using machine learning (ML), companies can efficiently identify customers that are likely to churn providing the opportunity to target the right customer at the right time with retention strategies. You can also apply ML as a part of a retention tactic, to provide insight on the next best offer to retain the customer! \n 📖 Read our use case to find out how: https://hubs.li/Q01tY5Bh0\n    submitted by    /u/PIEXCHANGE  \n [link]   [comments]",
