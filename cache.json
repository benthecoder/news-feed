I have multiple text fields such as:\n  \ntitle\n author\n subject\n description (long text)\n table of content (long text)\n  \nUntil now I was concatenating everything into one string and producing one TF-IDF vector for each book. Then I was simply running cosine similarity.\n Now I came to realize some features are more important than others. For example title similarity is more important than subject similarity, but I don't know how to incorporate that into the model. I was thinking of constructing a TF-IDF vector for each column and then calculating similarities separately, then weighting the similarity scores themselves. Is there a better way to achieve this?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/thecrixus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm trying to reverse engineer in my mind the process of returning summary statistics for a large dataset very quickly. I am thinking for example, returning data to a front end to create some charts on a webpage.\n Let's say we have a database recording the results of 20,000 matches of a game. The matches have all sorts of data, for example damage done by a certain spell every 10 seconds. It's a lot of data.\n We now want to return the total damage of the spell, \"fireball\", throughout all of the matches. A silly approach would be, every time a user visits a webpage, sum across all 20,000 matches find where spell = \"fireball\" and sum up each damage bit to get the total. This computation would take time regardless of overpaying for high levels of computational power.\n What I would consider doing in this case is create a new statistics portion of the database. It would include total damage for fireball. Each time you would finish a match, or at another time interval, you would simply add the damage to the total.\n When you want your statistics, you simply ping the fireball statistics and return the data. I think that this would work great because it would put minor computation requirements on your server frequently rather than massive computation whenever a user wants his stats.\n A problem comes up with this approach, what if you needed to report more complex statistics that you can't simply add to every time? If you wanted 95th quartile, or median, you would need to go through every game session and get yourself the entire series (let's call this a full database scan).\n My question: What sorts of approaches in data management are given for computing up to date complex statistics over large data sets? Would it be a batched process where we are not doing a full database scan every match, but perhaps every 500 matches? Is there any reading I can do to understand these types data/database management practices?\n    submitted by    /u/gunnerydota  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have what I think may be a simple request, but I don’t know where to start. I’d like to use a program to figure out how many unique groups I have by sorting two lists into a 3rd list. Let’s say list A has 100 locations, and list B has 20 products. All the items in list A require some of the products from list B. What I’m hoping to do is drag the items from List B over the items in List A thus creating a group, ie “item 1 in List A contains these 14 products” (and I need items in List B to be reusable across all the items in List A). Then I want the program to tell me how many locations in List A are receiving the same products (and which locations). Then afterwards I’ll know how many unique groupings of locations and products exist. I don’t know if card sorting would actually work here or if I have the wrong idea about what card sorting is. I’ve been able to do this in Excel somewhat successfully, but it’s more maintenance than help.

I recently discovered 365 Data Science's free courses until November 21, and I was able to obtain coupon codes for a 60% discount on their annual subscription, which costs $174 per year.\n I'm interested in their Data Analyst career track. A total of 44 hours of course content plus exams is required for the certificate of completion.\n Is there anyone here who has used their learning platform? I'd be delighted to hear from some of you. I'd also like to hear from users of other platforms like DataQuest, DataCamp, and so on. I searched for the same question in this forum but only found spam promotional posts.\n I'm stuck between this course and the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. According to what I've read online, the Google one costs $39 per month and lasts 181 hours. Due to its lower cost and shorter duration, this makes me lean more toward the 365DS program.\n Which certification has more credibility and is more useful? I'm looking for a more job-ready option and something to help me overcome my poor academic performance.
