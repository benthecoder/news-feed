Because of specifics of my job I need to have a powerful workstation(I mostly need a powerful CPU) and I am comfortable with at least two 27\" monitors. Traveling with that much stuff is only possible with a car, and even then the whole setup takes too much space.\nLaptops are getting there with the compute power, but the 27\" monitors aren't getting any smaller. Meta Quest Pro(which seems to be the top of the line now) has been just released and even tho it is somewhat pricey($1500), it still costs as much as three good 27\" monitors.\nDoes anyone have any useful experience to share on working in a VR headset? Is it comfortable for longer periods of time? How is it on the eyes?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33482215\nPoints: 146\n# Comments: 214",

Data scientists are oftentimes (but not always) the farthest from the value proposition and thus their impact is harder to quantify. This is manifested in some companies trimming or cutting their DS teams during this downturn, especially if data is not integral to the company's mission. Furthermore, after a decade of hype in data, schools are now churning out BA and MA graduates with DS majors. DS jobs will NOT go away tomorrow, and senior (7+ yr exp) data scientists in data-focused organizations will be much more insulated than those just entering the field or in companies where data is an afterthought. But it seems to be the case that both the supply and demand for DS jobs are showing signs of shift…",

I suspect it would be beneficial to compile these using something like a data lake, among other things like publicly available data and 3rd party data, while down the line focusing on organizing / normalizing the data and maybe incorporating more expensive solutions like warehousing.\n If anyone has experience working on architecture on a small budget and with small to modest amounts of data I would be so grateful for recommendations or lessons learned. \n Thank you so much for any advice you can provide.\n    submitted by    /u/Significant_Camel361  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've tried reading up about it from this article. \n ​\n What I can understand is that KL-divergence is a way to compare 2 different distributions from one another? I don't quite understand it. It doesn't calculate the distance between the data points but rather measures the divergence of one probability distribution from another? (This part is a bit blurry to me) \n So, let's say we're using a model, and we test it on 2 different samples. From there we are comparing how those 2 distributions are different with one another? Thus, what can we accomplish after this? I'm trying to wrap my head around this concept and see how beneficial it is. \n On top of that, in the original reddit post, there are some that suggested using chi squared test/p-value. I'm guessing this is under the topic of hypothesis testing? If anyone has any good references for this topic and how to actually apply it in a data science scenario, that would be highly appreciated. \n If there is any confusion in my writing, do let me know and I'll try to clarify it.

It highlights issues with current AI systems and ways to create better human-centric AI by using data-driven learning.\n It also presents our new framework \"Inverse Q-Learning\", which forms a major theoretic advance over Inverse Reinforcement Learning, to train AI agents using sparse data. This framework has also been used to create the best AI agent for playing Minecraft using a few expert demos.\n Please read and share!!
