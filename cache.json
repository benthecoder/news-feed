In the last few years I've played lots of CTFs, pwned several boxes on Hack the Box, studied and reproduced CVEs, etc. I have the technical knowledge.\nI don't think that I want to do pentests or bug bounty. I'm more into research. I like to be the one ahead discovering new stuff. But, how do I get there? Who hires someone like that? What do you need to get the role? How is this job for real?

          "description": "Hey,\nI lead the technical efforts at one of the charities in Ukraine; we're now trying to rebuild connectivity for people in some of the areas where much of the civilian infrastructure was destroyed and Starlink® is not a viable option, or perhaps \"not-to-be easily scaled option.\"\nThe world of long-range Wi-Fi is a wild one!\nWe are now trying to evaluate the cost of a point-to-point mesh network using commodity hardware, and so far have only experimented with Raspberry hardware to work the antenna, and some Atheros AR9331-based SoC's. The idea is to make a single device that can act as both a relay station, as well as an actual hotspot, it then can be placed in line-of-sight configuration to potentially cover huge areas (the accepted performance would be anywhere from 0.1-1 Mbit/s point-to-point over anywhere from 5-20km. We are aiming to bring the cost of such configuration down to $100 per unit at least. Hopefully, we also wouldn't need to do so and somebody else could do the whole thing for us at a similar price... Where would you start, i.e. with the vendors, as well as the commodity hardware, firmware that should work best for a setup like this? Bonus points; if it can be somewhat be aware of the current happenstance. In terms of bleed from Electronic warfare deployed by the enemy in Ukraine; it has to work hopefully in adversarial environment!\nBest regards,\nIlya\nThe Stone Cross Foundation\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34567704\nPoints: 281\n# Comments: 57",

A Supply Chain undergrad from a top 3 university in that field and an MBA from a top 10-15 university and about 10 years of professional experience overall. \n I believe I am also cutting myself short when it comes to salary expectations. The job I just left paid out $100k in TC which at the time, was a decent salary in LCOL city and I was getting a company to pay me to learn in a real world environment instead of the structure of a class room or MOOC. \n Any advice would be appreciated.\n EDIT\n If I had to relocate it would be to Austin (lived there for before), Nashville, DC, or NYC (all three of those are closer to family).\n    submitted by    /u/DS_Thro  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I wasn’t even intending to go for grad school right after my dual BS CS BS DS program, but I found out I would qualify for a full tuition and fee scholarship for UMSI’s MSI program at Michigan. I’d do the big data analytics curriculum full time and finish in the standard 2 years with a required internship in the summer between the first and second year.\n I’m pretty much already fully invested as it’s a free master of science at a top 5 public uni, so I thought I’d ask what y’all think of the situation, particularly the opportunity cost of delaying full professional entry into the field by 2 more years for an at worst tangentially-related graduate degree. Thanks!\n Some other notes: I’d likely be able to fund living expenses comfortably the entire time, and I’m a nontraditional student finishing undergrad in late 20s with some internships as a data analyst and “machine learning engineer” (more like data engineering bleh)\n    submitted by    /u/baeristaboy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "FYI I'm still a student so if there's sth I'm missing and/or misunderstanding, do enlightment me on this topic. Esp. from the perspective of practitioners in the real work setting.\n When it comes to hyperparams tuning, I've always been directed to using GridSearchCV or RandomSearchCV and that's the end of that. However, I've never really felt that those 2 are the best methods as the former seems to be rather arbitrary and the latter, well, simply random. After more research, I found out abt Bayesian optimization and based on my experience using it so far, it's always outperformed GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV.\n If u're a practitioner in the field, do u use Bayesian optimization for hyperparams tuning or not? Is there perhaps a more practical reason as to why/why not? (e.g. from a computing cost perspective, etc.)? Since GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV are so prevalent, it appears that they're the go to method for hyperparams tuning altho they're suboptimal compared to Bayesian optimization - even some practitioners I've managed to ask abt the subject actually do know abt Bayesian optimization as a concept but don't rly use it in production.\n Appreciate ＆ thanks for the insights in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/YsrYsl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I notice a lot of my research at work ends up taking me to methods in information theory or signal processing. I was wondering what graduate college courses in mathematics would be most helpful to me as a data scientist. I have an undergrad in mathematics with calc, linear algebra, probability and statistics, ODE, analysis, etc. but no PDE, information theory, signal processing or graph theory. I also don’t have any courses in advanced or specific statistics courses such as time series analysis, combinatorics, or Bayesian inference—although I’m familiar with the fundamentals from my undergrad probability courses.\n I’m already pretty familiar with most of the models and methods in elements of statistical learning. It’s more about being able to develop or understand novel methods and having a foundational base that prepares me for anything.\n    submitted by    /u/CSCCguy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Farmers still exist today but they exist in drastically fewer numbers than two centuries ago. The modern farming machinery and techniques did not replace farmers but made the industry much less labor intensive. \n Nowadays programming is a labor intensive activity with relative high salaries. AI is introducing the possibility to do this activity, that worldwide cost companies billions of dollars in programmers salaries, much more efficiently.\n In my opinion, this is the goal of companies like OpenAI. They know that they can’t remove humans out of the loop because current AI is not able to substitute all human cognitive capabilities that intervine in a software developer daily job; like talking with the client, figuring out what he wants and translating it to functional requirements. \n But nonetheless, they think they have a clear shot to make programming a non labor intensive activity like farming is today. \n Of course, this is a compelling multibillion business opportunity that is attracting increasing capital from the tech and the financial sectors.\n    submitted by    /u/masterile  \n [link]   [comments]",
