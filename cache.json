The reason is that I find myself enjoying writing code to automate things and create apps more than I really do linear regressions and analyses really. I also took some Udemy courses a while ago and really loved learning general python programming more so than I did a python for ML course.\n I've also been feeling jaded by my work experiences too, which is also partly why I want to switch.

I am a very quick learner and have an exceptionally good memory. Our team is very new to the bank and we have lots of initiatives and projects. As someone who doesn't forget and is good at keeping track I kind of took on a lot of duties and helped my team catch up with projects that we were behind on. \n Now, I love my job and I love my boss. But is it normal for a junior with a lower pay to do all these things? At this point I am responsible for running and maintaining at least 3 credit risk models among other things. My boss and other higher ups recognize how much I contribute as well and I know if I don't keep up with some of these things probably Noone will. The impact of the models I run is huge as they are very visible. (2k people use it) \n Do I ask for a raise? What are generally normal expectations of someone like me who came with little experience and junior level? I don't even know how to advocate for myself because I don't know how the industry works so any help is very appreciated \n Thank you!!!!!\n    submitted by    /u/MembershipNice2192  \n [link]   [comments]",

When and how should each be used?\" I've asked FRED for help several times.

I currently work as Clinical Genetics Technologist, where my role is to conduct wet lab for various genetic testing and perform analysis on said testing results to be reported back to patients via physicians/genetic counsellors. My job has gotten pretty stale, repetitive, and healthcare in general feels very unrewarding, given the ever increasing workload post-pandemic but very low compensation in return. \n I've been using my free education credits and continuing education hours to learn about tech in general. I took a part time Data Analytics course at a bootcamp and I really enjoyed it. SQL was really interesting, I didn't have any issue learning it and I breezed through the Excel part. I am now trying out Python Programming class - which is going well so far. I've been checking out FCC too just to check out software development but coding CSS is kinda not fun...\n I have no formal background in tech. My formal education is in biology which I followed through with an advanced diploma to become a certified clinical genetics tech. I took introductory calc, linear algebra, ODE and stats classes during my undergrad and they were easy but probably meant nothing to DS in general.\n I'm currently exploring around and checking out avenues for career change. DS sounds super interesting to me and ngl, the (average) pay will be a huge boost from my current job lol. For a beginner, what are some of the best things I can do to move into the field?

          "description": "I've seen a lot of thinkpieces regarding the likes of LLMs like ChatGPT, and what they signify about the future for AI and ML and society at large... but not a lot of teasing out of the business strategy behind OpenAI releasing what amounted to a tuned up version of GPT-3 a few months before GPT-4... especially for free... in the fourth quarter of 2022. \n It feels like it would be an interesting thought exercise, if nothing else to start thinking about it and what it could mean about what is going to happen in Q2, presumably when GPT-4 comes out. (With its massive parameter count that is rumored to be up to 500 times larger than GPT3).\n Obviously, there's the benefit of doing this early for exposure: tech companies are renowned for wanting to generate buzz for any number of reasons, and the freemium model is of course part of the playbook. \n Then of course there's the training that they're getting from the public's qualitative assessment of what is being produced from the model.\n But I'm not entirely convinced those two factors are what is at play here.\n I'm thinking mainly in terms of the competitive landscape. Lamda (Google's LLM) has even more parameters than GPT4 but yet openAI was willing to expose its own competitive advantage (enough that a \"code red\" was called at Google HQ not long after the release).\n Then, I'm also thinking about Sankar tweeting out and then deleting that GPT4 Is proto AGI and will pass the Turing Test hands down. And of course Altman making the rounds in the podcast circuit dropping very interesting hints about how 2022 will seem \"like a sleepy year for AI.\"\n My mind immediately goes to this was very much a trial balloon, testing the waters for how society will react to tech that will cause a massive and shocking shift.\n I'm wondering when you all think about this. Why release GPT 3.5? What are they doing? What do you think it serves for them? What does it say about GPT-4 could bring?\n Edit: added context\n    submitted by    /u/gaudiocomplex  \n [link]   [comments]",
