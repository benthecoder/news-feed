          "description": "The topic of data recovery from broken phones seems to be a prime target from SEO optimised blogspam so I'm posting here in hopes that someone had a similar issue in the past and may be able to help me out.\nI am tasked with restoring some photos from a Huawei P30 that has a broken screen/touchpad. The photos were stored on the device directly, unfortunately not on an SD card or on a cloud provider. The phone does still turn on (it vibrates when plugged into a power outlet and shows up on Windows). However, it's only showing an installer for HiSuite (which did not help), not the file system. USB debugging is enabled.\nThings I tried so far and didn't work:\n- shining a flashlight at the screen to see if only the backlight is broken (it seems the whole screen is done for)\n- eyeballing it and trying to blindly enter the passcode\n- connecting phone to external monitor and keyboard via USB-C -> HDMI (monitor stays black)\nIs there anything that may still have a chance of working short of replacing the screen to unlock the phone? Thanks and happy holidays.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34131436\nPoints: 45\n# Comments: 33",

I have over two years of experience in software engineering and university math base(L.A, probability, calc). I started my journey by taking the Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng, and I successfully completed it! Meanwhile, I was contributing to my little GitHub repo, where I was re-implementing basic ML algorithms and related tools from scratch(Linear/Logistic regression, trees, neural nets, normalizations, optimizers, etc.). My plan for the next months is to practice my ML skills on Kaggle and then actively engage in building an actual ML project or even become active in my undergraduate research.\n The question:\n Recently, I started with a basic Titanic problem as means to start learning and practicing. However, now I wonder what is the best way to approach the Kaggle problems to maximize my learning output? What is a good methodology to solve Kaggle's problems? Are there any great step-by-step instructions on what I should focus on before trying the model? What should I focus on? \n My findings so far about the question:\n What I have learned so far is that I think it is dumb to simply pick and try ML models without understanding your data. Right now, I am trying to apply for EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis(trying to learn some trends, visualize the data, draw some conclusions)), and based on that, I believe I might feature engineer some data, or maybe get rid of some features completely, and only then to start picking models. However, I wonder, is it the best way to do it? Moreover, how do I conduct a great EDA? How useful is it? Are there any other steps I might need to do before or after EDA, Data Engineering, and finally, model picking?\n    submitted by    /u/AlexanderBrozov  \n [link]   [comments]",

(If they had only listed one problem, they had to use up their 10 points, thus weighting their only problem with 10 points, while other participants possibly had to distribute their contingent)\n The goal of the survey is to find out the \"importance\" of each problem and then publish it. (each participant is equally or at least similarly experienced and can be considered an expert)\n The problem is, that some people have listed completely different problems than others, in many cases, there is no overlap at all.…",

          "description": "Been an industry data scientist for 6 years in fintech and gaming.\n In fintech, I sensed a need for interpretability and robustness. Also, I was not working with a lot of data(~500k observations to train models). Consequently, I got into the habit of building tree-based models by default, specifically xgboost. Used explainability techniques such as shap to explain models. \n After moving to online gaming, the scrutiny is less and the scale is far more. I now have the freedom to use deep learning. I need to be able to demonstrate the effectiveness using experiments, but beyond that, do not need explainability at a granular level. Advantages I see with using deep learning-\n  \nCustom loss functions - basically any differentiable loss function can be trained on. This has huge advantages when the business goal is not aligned with the loss functions out of the box\n Learning Embeddings - The ability to condense features into dense, latent representations which can be used for any number of use cases\n Multiple outputs per model - tweaking the architecture\n  \nSee all this, Deep learning seems to offer a lot of advantages, even if the performance might be similar to tree-based methods.
