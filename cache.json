I have a few questions about the qualifications, the job, and what is expected of me:\n 1.) How much of an advantage will pursuing a Master's in Data Science get me if I opt to do it?\n 2.) Does a PhD for Data Science (or another doctorate level degree) exist for Data Science? Again, is it worth pursuing?\n 3.) If a PhD exists for Data Science, is it something Id do AFTER a Masters Degree, or something that would substitute a Masters, and Id do immediately after undergrad?\n 4.) What are the daily expectations of a Data Scientist, and what are the overall work conditions?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Wild-Ocelot-3301  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thankfully, the advisor was more accommodating than the dean would have been...\n As a graduation requirement, I'm supposed to present it at an external academic conference, but I'm pessimistic about the quality of my paper (COVID and depression really messed me up and I am not a great scientist or a coder) and whether it'll pass or not, given that my current application is beint co-hosted by two fairly conservative universities from conservative countries. Might have to present next year if this application doesn't pass.\n Does anyone know any English-language academic conferences where this paper would be appropriate that I could attend (preferably remotely) at my sophomoric level? Tried doing some searches, but I am a fish out of water when it comes to social science and data science academia. Spent most of my uni years during lockdown, which still continues here.\n I'm moving next year, which further complicates things.\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/-o00  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wanted to try XGBoost when I had the idea to treat it as a regression problem. So I fit the dataset with the binary classes using the XGB regressor. I then predicted the test set on it. Of course l, the output was continuous (i.e. 0.11, 0.2 etc). Of course, this can’t be passed into the classification evaluation metrics. \n I then set a normal benchmark (<0.5:0, >=0.5:1).

When I told him of some of my offers, he dismissed those other organizations and kind of insinuated how those organizations won't be as respected by tech companies (a few of them were from govt). He also talked about all the benefits of the company but when I asked him whether there's a complete list of the terms and benefits, he said it's only available to see if I choose to accept the offer. So I can't even see the terms and benefits before I accept the offer? The most confusing part is how he said that he won't make me an offer until I'm 100% sure I'll choose his company as he doesn't want to waste time going through all the admin process for someone who won't definitely join. Isn't it his job to make the contract for me to review before I decide whether I'm joining? Rn I only have a brief overview of the terms, how do I decide whether I'm gonna join based on that??\n Edit: oh and I asked for a week or two to consider the verbal offer, but he said that the offer might be gone in two weeks. Is this normal?? I'm still waiting for other offers so I though 1-2 weeks would be normal to consider an offer.

I can already see a lot of my time going into more fundamental data access questions e.g. accessing silos, lobbying for software or infrastructure. \n The work is not necessarily hard-core data engineering (no heavy coding or setting up of servers) but there's a lot of making sure that the infrastructure and different intermediate data layers will be there in the future, to be implemented by other experts. Some form of ETL will definitely need to be organised.\n The company approach for data science is halfway sound from what I can see. Specific people have put quite some thought in what they want to achieve and parts of the data landscape are working well - while other parts are either in silos, haven't been anywhere near CRISP-DM or are still analogue. However, it just feels really small compared to the rest of the company. As a plus, the support of my department is there and people are fully behind the digitalisation effort.\n I've mainly been reading, learning and getting to know the business side which is great but I foresee see a two-year path ahead of just laying additional groundwork for enabling easy data access + analyses in the future. I'm not complaining. I know that I'm capable of doing this job, that it will be fun and that I'm extremely lucky to be in the position that I'm in. There's a lot to be learned.

However when I get test scores of 0.95 or over, I start getting nervous. Am I overfitting the data?\n Since GridSearchCV utilises cross validation and all the training is done with data separate from the one used to evaluate the model, I believe I am doing the right thing to prevent overfitting and poor model performance on unknown data, but a test score of over 0.95 on the test data still makes me a bit anxious. Or are my worries unfounded?\n Is there literature/expert advice stating what score ranges you should aim to train a model that can be deployed without too much worrying about overfitting the data?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/William_Rosebud  \n [link]   [comments]",

Their clairvoyance allows Tom Cruise and his \"Precrime\" police force to avert nearly all potential homicides.\n Twenty years on, in the real world, scientists and law enforcement agencies are using data mining and machine learning to mimic those psychics. Such \"predictive policing\", as it is called, is based on the fact that many crimes—and criminals—have detectable patterns.\n Predictive policing has enjoyed some successes.

          "description": "This is a rather simple project written in PHP, JavaScript, and some backend database code. Essentially, it uses the fantastic NewsAPI to automatically gather news headlines on a daily basis from about 50k different publishers, which include basically all the sources used by Google News. These headlines are then analyzed for syllable count and the site attempts to write haikus out of them. Only the most popular 5-7-5 syllable form of haikus are used, and unfortunately because the syllable counter is not perfect, the haikus generated do not always conform exactly to the syllable rules (but most of the time they do). The haikus themselves are generated on demand, so each time you refresh the page, you should see a new haiku. However, the data sources (news articles) only update once per day. The haiku is then fed into DeepAI's Stable Diffusion API to generate an image corresponding to the haiku. To keep things interesting, this image is either returned with no filter, a comic book filter, impressionist painting filter, or caricature filter. Note that the image takes around 20 seconds to load so it may take a moment to display. The image can essentially be thought of as a visual display of the generated haiku.\n http://www.haiknews.com\n    submitted by    /u/southside915  \n [link]   [comments]",
