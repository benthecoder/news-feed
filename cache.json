          "description": "Hi all! Are you a data enthusiast looking for opportunities to highlight your work and win cash prizes? Interested in researching how access to green space impacts public health? If the answer is yes, then the Green Space Data Challenge hosted by the Massive Data Institute at Georgetown’s McCourt School of Public Policy is for you! \n Undergraduate students, graduate students, and early-career professionals are invited to participate in the data challenge during the entire month of February 2023 to create or improve indicators involving green space to better understand and measure community impact. \n Participants will access various data sources on our Redivis platform in individual or team notebooks to transform green space data into community indicators. They will conduct their analyses and submit a short project narrative that describes the research question, analytic approach, and key findings. All submissions will be evaluated by judges based on the relevance, completeness, and quality of the submission. \n There will be separate prize categories for submissions examining the effects of green space on the following subject areas: community health, community safety, specific populations, and physical environment. Winners can receive $5,000 for first place prizes, $2,000 for second place prizes, and $1,000 for third place prizes. Winners will also be invited to present their project at a webinar hosted by the Association of Public Data Users (APDU) and at APDU’s annual conference in July 2023. \n Click here to learn more about the data challenge and to register.\n Please help us spread the word and invite anyone eligible in your networks!\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/rn0wdqrxagba1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=558a192ac7d71099ea767d06e748e6199fb8f390\n    submitted by    /u/georgetownpbi  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been getting into data science/data analysis recently by doing some courses on Coursera and EDX, and I'm loving it. I've always been an analytical thinker, and I'm great at finding patterns and connections, and I have great logical thinking skills.\n I am yet to learn Python, SQL, R, etc. more in-depth, but I have learned over 17 languages. Even if it doesn't seem like programming languages and natural languages have anything in common, I'd like to differ, since both of them require learning a different code, structure, and usage, so I'm used to organizing my ideas using different patterns.\n I have heard many stories of people in similar situations who came from fields completely unrelated to data science that managed to thrive upon doing some courses on the internet and maybe getting some certificates elsewhere. I am afraid that it's too late for me to even attempt to join the field and I'd like to know if there's anyone with an unconventional trajectory through data science.\n I know this is something I enjoy, and I would like to put to use my analytical/mathematical/logical thinking skills which in political science would be useless. I don't know, however, if this is within my realm of possibilities.\n I know most of you are math or engineering graduates, so I'd like to know if many of you are not.\n    submitted by    /u/frootloop2000  \n [link]   [comments]",

(I went through almost half of the chapters in linear algebra and its applications by David C. Lay, completing 80% of its associated problems and felt like it was as fun as playing Monster Hunter World or Guild Wars 2.)\n However, I am unable to find any placement statistics for the masters, is this considered a red flag? Additionally, MH6211 Analytics Software I and MH6212 Analytics Software II cover SPS which according to some, is not really used in industry? I was also unable to find any reviews. I googled the degree on linkedin and found that some alumni who had the degree are still data analysts 4 years after the degree while others are data scientists. Are data analysts considered entry level positions compared to data scientists? Can someone point out anything that stands out in the curriculum?\n Am I better off with Georgia Tech’s Online Master of Science in Analytics (OMS Analytics)? I do have some basic knowledge of linear algebra, programming with python and introductory classical physics and do prefer learning on my own. Then there is also the masters in data science by the same university) but that seems to be too competitive for a non-CS major to get into. Or is the data science field too saturated right now for non-CS majors?\n Thanks for reading this far and any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/TheBHSP  \n [link]   [comments]",

We wanted to share a simple but effective method for finding valuable applications that keep delivering value for our business: look for software rules that are already in production, but are suboptimal, and upgrade them with a ML solution.\n This approach guarantees that you will work on something needed for the business as the rules are already in use. It will also guarantee that you will create value with ML as you are focusing on going from a working solution to optimized solution. Delivering a ML solution that creates value is a great way to prove that ML is relevant to your business and that further investments should be made into it. We believe ML still has lots of potential to improve businesses and consumer experiences across industries.\n We wrote an article sharing a detailed example of this strategy that helped us to save thousands of orders from cancellation and make all sides of our marketplace happy.

          "description": "I have spent a good decade or so getting all the skills I can for Artificial Intelligence, completing a degree at university in the subject in 2020. My problem is I tend to focus a lot on community and relationship building online rather than money making. I find it hard to make money, find a job in this area etc... I thought with the recent popularity of certain products and such this might be a good time to ask. I am fed up of sitting round waiting for an opportunity or expecting one from someone. You can possibly call me an 'AI Expert' sitting around doing nothing in a sense. But I don't like using that term to describe myself. I am fed up of endless studying of the subject, there is only so much I can learn. I would even be willing to contribute to projects for free. \n Basically, the advice I need, how do I make money or find a job in AI at the moment? \n I know what you probably think, there must be tons of jobs in AI, probably, but they are a challenge to find, with most focusing on Data Science for one thing and many other reasons. Anyway I thought I would take my shot and ask at the moment whilst AI seems to be in the news a lot, I don't want to miss the opportunity. Note this is not really self promotion, I am actually genuinely asking the best way to at least start to find a job, e.g. good AI job websites etc... or apps I could make or something like this. I have never been good at being a business person so I find these kinds of things hard to do.\n    submitted by    /u/JamieCropley  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There are several reasons why Microsoft may be better positioned to benefit from acquiring OpenAI than Google or any other competitors. Microsoft already has a collaboration and partnership deal with Open AI and has invested 1 billion dollars. Also, Microsoft has started using the GPT-3 in their products. One great example is Power Apps, which uses GPT-3 technology and helps to democratize the development experience by empowering developers who don't have coding experience. \n Microsoft is a financially stable large organization, which means that it would have the abundant resources to fully build on top of what Open AI has created so far and also to commercialize the technology. Microsoft already has a sizable enterprise customer base, which could be advantageous. Existing products such as Windows, Office 365, Azure, Business Applications, which consist of D365 and Power Platform-related products, and LinkedIn will benefit from the use of advanced AI. Therefore, incorporating OpenAI's technology into these existing products could create significant value for Microsoft and help it edge ahead of the competition easily.\n    submitted by    /u/ReputationBubbly8112  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For the past 2 weeks or so I have used ChatGPT as a story teller for text based adventures but the last update ruined it. Now instead of properly describing a scene it gives very short descriptions, always forces the story and my character's actions towards good endings and keeps giving lectures about morality. I tell the AI I stumble upon a lamp and a genie comes out, giving me 3 wishes for freeing it. The AI writes 1 paragraph describing the lamp and the genie, 2 paragraphs writing about how these wishes won't affect anything in real life and this is not real... What the hell?! Why do they keep ruining the AI with every update. This last one literally lobotomized it.\n    submitted by    /u/IBNCTWTSF  \n [link]   [comments]",
