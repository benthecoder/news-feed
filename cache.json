Here's an example to describe what I'm getting at.\n just say I'm trying to predict what picture a person is looking at based upon their brain activity, which I measure with EEG as a time series, across 128 electrodes. with a neural network can I just feed in the raw time series voltage recordings, and that will take case of discerning any valuable features, or should I also create a bunch of feature from the data - like mean, std. dev, median, entropy etc?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Steve_Sizzou  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Pls redirect me to the right place if I'm lost.\n Is there an independent non-human entity that build things in real life?\n Here's an example. Software. I write software that does the following\n Contact building construction companies\n Give one of them a job e.g temple, monument, etc with detailed instructions about design, location, etc\n Pay them (software interacts with online banking, 2FA stuff, and is good enough to work despite UI changes, so software has control over bank accounts that are funded for this purpose. server costs, 2fa costs, etc are paid from this account as well.. )\n Check if the job is complete\n Do this once a year for the next N years\n ps funds in the account are invested in index funds and the software withdraws money only when needed. server is rented from 5 different large providers in case 4 of them stops working in the way that the software knows how to interact. software is run concurrently from 5 locations in case 4 of them goes out. etc .. I can write 2 more pages of details to make this sound a lot more realistic but I hope you get the idea\n I die and no one else knows that this exists. Yet this entity keeps creating buildings in real life.\n    submitted by    /u/TWO-AT-THE-SAME-TIME  \n [link]   [comments]",
