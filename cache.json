While trying to add logs to my application, I couldn't find any lightweight log platform which was easy to set up without adding tons of dependencies to my code, or configuring 10,000 files.\nErLog is just a simple go web server which batch inserts json logs into an sqlite3 server. Through tuning sqlite3 and batching inserts, I find I can get around 8k log insertions/sec which is fast enough for small projects.\nThis is just an MVP, and I plan to add more features once I talk to users. If anyone has any problems with logging, feel free to leave a comment and I'd love to help you out.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34756156\nPoints: 39\n# Comments: 18",

I use this sub as a direct resource for learning data science so your advice is very much appreciated on my end.\n Currently I’m an undergraduate studying Data Science at a top 10 school globally. Although I’ve felt that my major’s curriculum has helped me establish a solid understanding of the math, programming, and analytical aspects of data science, my major has generally been focused on predictive modeling rather than inferential modeling. \n At this point in time, I have taken four different ML/DL courses where I’ve gained a pretty strong grounding in classical ML techniques, core DL frameworks, and implementation/productization. However, although I’ve learned through classes and self-studying regression analysis and hypothesis testing, I have yet to take a class solely dedicated to inferential modeling as a whole.\n This coming quarter, should I take my 5th ML/DL course to further establish my knowledge and approach to predictive modeling, or should I take a course solely dedicated to Applied Regression Analysis (name of the course) to gain a better grounding in inferential modeling?\n TLDR; Should I take 5th ML/DL course or 1st regression analysis/inferential modeling course?\n    submitted by    /u/PuzzleheadedGuava102  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So long story short, my undergrad was in international affairs, nothing technical. I touched R a little bit but nothing extensive. I decided during the pandemic I was going to push to get a STEM masters to supplement my undergrad and I knocked it out. I really enjoyed it and I can use a ton of tools to develop ML solutions and deploy models leveraging tools like Sagemaker. I’ve even become an OK programmer. The issue I have is many of these solutions and tools are black box. I can apply the tool to solve a problem but I don’t always know how it works and, being honest, there’s a lot of effing tools. \n I feel like I’ve got a good warm and fuzzy about what data science and ML can do and what it can’t but I find a lot of jobs will post their need for people with extensive education in quantitative skills, or vast experience with A/B testing which I understand but haven’t done extensively, or 6 years building solutions with Tensorflow. Thus, I feel like I might be wildly under skilled despite the degree. \n Maybe the industry is just so flooded now that DS roles really require a deep specialized knowledge because it’s so competitive. Seems like there are lots of PhD roles in industry these days. \n Would it make sense for me to go back and hammer out the math? Another undergrad? Another masters maybe? Push forward and do a PhD and lose steady income for the 4 years maybe more?\n Maybe this is classic imposter syndrome. I digress. But anyway, advice is always good to have.\n    submitted by    /u/sonictoddler  \n [link]   [comments]",

People I talk to are afraid of it, but in using ChatGPT I have realised the fear is unfounded. Sure, data security and privacy of information is paramount, and there will certainly be many lost jobs and problems associated to it, but I am already seeing the incredible benefits of this service will far outweigh all of them in the future for humanity.\n The current limitations are because people havent become aware of just how useful this thing is going to be to us. My biggest concern is the speed we will come to rely on it will make living without it impossible within one generation. \n Is there anywhere better than reddit I could be asking this question?

          "description": "Hello \n I had a question and am not sure if I'm supposed to ask it here. If not can you please tell me where I should take my question? \n I was wondering how to make an AI-generated video in a similar fashion to this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO3q6MA668 or the AI batman story, where you input a large amount of text and it spitting back out a new script in a similar style to the original.\n I was hoping to use this method for my youtube channel of 681 videos, taking all of the transcripts from each video, feeding that into the program, and seeing what funny nonsense it spits back out and making a video on it. \n ​\n What program or tool should I use and what would you recommend for the steps to achieve the best results? Is this really too far out of my league? Thank you :)\n    submitted by    /u/Raptorkiller20  \n [link]   [comments]",
