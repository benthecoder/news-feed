Our mission is to allow people and businesses to mitigate risks that relate to them.\nWe got into finance early during our time at MIT. Tarek worked at Goldman and Citadel, Luana worked at Bridgewater and Citadel. We noticed something common across all these places: a lot of trading stemmed from an opinion on a future event.

Now, the stakeholders which are the sales team and my boss don't trust the output of the whole thing (anymore).\n Measures I took to build trust:\n  \nincluded unit tests with test cases in order to verify aggregation and construction of metrics\n separate aggregation and plotting into different steps of the pipeline\n made a diagram with data flow and all definitions\n rely mostly on well tested third party libraries (pandas and matplotlib)\n Versioning and documenting the code and the input to have reproducible pipeline runs\n  \nReasons why I think they don't trust it: * I am the only person developing it, so there is no review process and I could test my own logical errors with the unit tests * Communication between the sales team and me was suboptimal, i.e. the meaning of some metrics was not clear to them and I did not always get what the expected of some metrics were * The underling input data quality was poor and changing often but was out of my control. In the end it was blamed on the product even it was not it's fault * Development in production due to changing requirements, tight deadlines and feature request, which lead to minor bugs\n I am interested in your thoughts how I can improve the situation and how I can avoid similar problems in the future.\n    submitted by    /u/Life_Ad_6195  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! I'm working on a class project about the impact words have on how we perceive migrants. To develop the project based on this idea, I would like to show stock images and then show how they would change when generating variations (with an AI tool) of the same image. Essentially, to demonstrate how language can shape the perception that one has about a subject.\n Overall, I want to know if it is possible to develop an AI tool that generates variations of an initial image when adding text descriptors. Perhaps someone accessing the website could interact with the tool by adding textual descriptions that change the photo. This way, they would observe how stereotypes, words, and commonly used phrases change the original photos. Would you consider this feasible?\n As a result of using Google Translate, my idea wasn't clear. Hopefully, you'll understand my question better now since I translated it myself.\n Thanks in advance! :)\n    submitted by    /u/Candid-Bed3386  \n [link]   [comments]",
