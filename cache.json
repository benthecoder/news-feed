I’m thinking of asking my employer to grant 3 weeks off in December to visit my family. I haven’t seen them in 4 years because of various reasons (Covid included). \n I’m feeling very nervous asking for vacation in a new role, worried about my performance review etc. I feel like I have always been like this. In my last job, I took 1.5 weeks off in my 2 years when I was there. I miss my family a lot and it’s killing me being away from them for so long. \n Looking for words of encouragement.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/quite--average  \n [link]   [comments]",
