For example, if Amazon wants to change the design of the product cards, would they run an experiment. If so, how much MDE would they set and how would they come up with that value. For other features that generate revenue, we could just compare the cost of building the feature vs revenue that it would bring in and then come up with MDE. But for design changes, such as changing the look of the product card or surfacing more information on the product card, how would we justify the implementation of it.

          "description": "When it comes to developing some data product, my workflow has firmly established in Jupyter, where I can run-evaluate-rerun small blocks of code, until I'm happy with result, package it in a function and move on to next problem, rinse and repeat.\n However, at some point you have to move out of experimental sandbox to a proper code base, that integrates with broader stack of entire product. Refactoring into clean, documented functions, tests, I/O contracts, deployment strategy, wrapping in service.\n It does feel like it's not optimal, as I often tend to revert back to Jupyter to debug or change things up, then returning back to proper project. So I tried cutting Jupyter out of the workflow, to have everything in the same place and avoiding unnecessary extra steps. But it just doesn't work for me! I can't seem to figure it out whether it's the force of habbit, or I'm missing something important. I end up having several sandbox scripts, every py file has some random 'if name==main' block to try out functions contained within, etc. \n What is your workflow, as the project gets more complex and you have to maintain a stable code base?\n    submitted by    /u/statespace37  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is my first reddit post, so please forgive me if this is not the place to be posting asking for advice/guidance.\n I wanted to turn to this community as I feel extremely alone. I have virtually zero network. I have a few family members/family friends who work in the tech industry, but not in tech roles. Aside from that, I don't have any peers, coworkers, or friends that I know who would understand my situation.\n I graduated with my B.S. in Statistics back in March of this year.

She lives in a different country for a job opportunity and one of the ways I keep in touch with her is by sending her pictures of the sunset every night and I thought it would be cool for at the end of her contract if I could generate an image using all of the ones I sent her but I can’t find any image to image generators. Would I be better off just training a text prompt-image program on all the images and creating it that way? Any suggestions for a sappy romantic gesture help!
