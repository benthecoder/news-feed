We heard from a lot of people that the biggest thing holding them back from starting a company was that they didn't want to do it alone and didn't have any friends who wanted to do it with them.\nSo we built a site that's similar to a dating site but for co-founders, and launched it on HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27750298.\nLike any new product, we weren't sure how well this would work.  Other people had tried this idea before, and none of them had really taken off.

Reasoning is that I have 5 million rows of data at the individual level, but only 100 companies exist in that data.\n For example: I want to calculate the % increase in earnings an investment firm earns year over year.\n My Level 1 data would contain fields such as: Analyst_Id, Company_Name, Age, Earnings_2019, Earnings_2020, Level_of_Education, Company_region, Number_of_Trades\n I can use this data to calculate characteristics for each Company_Name: Total_Earnings_2019, Average Investor Age, Average number of trades made, and company region.\n The results should be interpreted at the Company level - ie, the user can input a company's average age, region, and average level of education and the output will be a predicted earnings trend for a company with those characteristics.\n I've been looking into Multilevel modeling / hierarchical lineal models / nested data structures, but these techniques appear to combine individual & group level variables in the final model, whereas I would be building a model that only has group characteristics.\n Which modeling techniques would make sense for this scenario?\n    submitted by    /u/idk287  \n [link]   [comments]",

I fully recognize that I'll feel inadequate to get a job in the field after a 6 month program, I know. However, I took it as an introduction and am looking at other educational tools after this that could help me become more competent and ready for a job after this. I've also been thinking about taking a year or so working as a data _analyst_ to get some sort of experience then upskill and upgrade to a data _scientist_. Does that make sense? Or should I finish this program I'm doing and immediately jump into something like a master's program for data science? If that's a bad idea, let me know. I'm currently looking at the one online from U of Colorado Boulder. As you can see, I'm a little lost and feel like I'm in over my head. Maybe I am!

This was in the context of plasma physics. After the PhD I worked for a few months in a large video game company developing some frameworks in C++, but I quit since the project wasn't so interesting in the end and I was afraid of being stuck in there for a long time. Right now I am back to my old lab with a temporary research contract. \n I would like to leave academia and have a more stable and compelling job with a nice salary, so I was considering going to Data Science since I think it's something that really suits me given my background, but I am a bit hesitant due to the number of people I read saying it's quite a competitive field to enter right now. Another option would be to go to something like mobile/web dev, but I feel that it would be less interesting. \n I see a lot of people telling how to start in the DS field, by making a portfolio, etc. But I am not exactly sure what would be the best approach in my case. What would be the best strategy in your opinion? Do you think DS is still a field where someone with my profile is needed? \n Thanks in advance! :)\n    submitted by    /u/gray-fog  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thus incurring additional cost.\n I built a simple linear regression model that plots item ID on a graph that has service level % on x-axis and transportation cost on the y-axis. This was strait forward. Now I want to build a similar graph that shows the sum total of our transportation spend on the y-axis. This would demonstrate that with each percent increase in overall inbound service level, we can decrease overall transportation costs by X.\n My questions are:\n  \nIs it mathematically correct to translate the first analysis into the second?\n How would I go about building the second graph based on the first analysis?

          "description": "Once upon a time, in the Hundred Acre Wood, Winnie the Pooh was feeling down in the dumps. All of his friends were busy with their own activities and he was feeling left out. Pooh decided to take a walk and ended up stumbling upon a mysterious honey pot that had \"BB\" written on it.\n Curious, Pooh started to investigate and discovered that the honey pot was actually a cover for a hidden laboratory run by a character similar to Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad. The character was cooking up a batch of special honey, which Pooh was immediately drawn to.\n Despite the character's warnings, Pooh couldn't resist the delicious aroma and sneaked a taste. He was shocked to find that the honey was not only the sweetest he had ever tasted, but it also gave him a burst of energy and focus that he had never experienced before.\n Intrigued, Pooh started to spend more time with the character, helping him with his honey making and learning about the science behind it. Pooh soon discovered that the character was using the honey to pay for his granddaughter's medical treatment, just like in Breaking Bad.\n Pooh felt a sense of camaraderie with the character and wanted to help. Together, they came up with a plan to create a legitimate business selling the special honey, but with a focus on using the profits to help others in need.\n As their business grew, so did their friendship. Pooh was no longer feeling left out, as he was now a part of something important and fulfilling. The two worked together, using their newfound skills and knowledge, to bring joy and happiness to the residents of the Hundred Acre Wood.\n And so, Winnie the Pooh and his friend from Breaking Bad lived happily ever after, spreading the sweet nectar of kindness and generosity to all.\n    submitted by    /u/v1ll3_m  \n [link]   [comments]",
