We’re focused on simplifying developer experience and ensuring best practices. Everything is open source.\nWhy another full-stack framework? And why a config language/DSL? We were still experiencing a lot of boilerplate (repetitive tasks) using other frameworks—things like duplicating data models across database/server/client, implementing CRUD API, setting up auth, and choosing and stitching together all parts of the stack.\nThere are two main reasons for the DSL approach - 1) short-term: simpler and cleaner DX via a …",

          "description": "We’ve trained a generative AI model to browse the web and answer questions/retrieve code snippets directly. Unlike ChatGPT, it has access to primary sources and is able to cite them when you hover over an answer (click on the text to go to the source being cited). We also show regular Bing results side-by-side with our AI answer.\nThe model is an 11-billion parameter T5-derivative that has been fine-tuned on feedback given on hundreds of thousands of searches done (anonymously) on our platform. Giving the model web access lessens its burden to need to store a snapshot of human knowledge within its parameters. Rather, it knows how to piece together primary sources in a natural and informative way. Using our own model is also an order of magnitude cheaper than relying on GPT.\nA drawback to aligning models to web results is that they are less inclined to generate complete solutions/answers to questions where good primary sources don’t exist. Answers generated without underlying citable sources can be more creative but are prone to errors. In the future, we will show both types of answers.\nExamples:\nhttps://beta.sayhello.so/search?q=set+cookie+in+fastapi\nhttps://beta.sayhello.so/search?q=What+did+Paul+Graham+learn...\nhttps://beta.sayhello.so/search?q=How+to+get+command+line+pa...\nhttps://beta.sayhello.so/search?q=why+did+Elon+Musk+buy+twit...\nWould love to hear your thoughts.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33910863\nPoints: 232\n# Comments: 147",

Essentially you're the most valuable (PhD) among the most valuable (Data Scientist) type of workers. Of course this assumes you actually used your PhD to do something interesting rather than just naval gaze, but if you naval gaze why even get a PhD?\n On the other: Data science is becoming increasing accessible. & Data science solutions are becoming more and more trivial. There are so many plug & play frameworks its ridiculous (e.g. any of the dozen good autoML packages, or hugging face pertained models, or libraries like gradio for deployment...).\n Given this where is the industry/research headed? Where are the actual bottlenecks? Is data science becoming trivial? Or am I seriously overestimating these plug & play solutions? ...I mean I don't mind learning these new packages & exploiting their efficiency. But it is a little concerning how fast things seem to be moving.\n    submitted by    /u/Udon_noodles  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can then ask causal attribution questions in the form of conditional probability queries against the BN.\n The idea is still pretty basic / preliminary, but I think it could be extended in all sorts of interesting ways e.g. attributing bad row-level data to upstream transformations, etc. Generally there are just a lot of graphical structures in data eng that make causal inference / attribution really interesting.

Clearly, there is overfitting here, but how should I treat it? If I perform a cross-validation into the training set and select the best hyperparameters and then train again a model with these parameters on all the training data and I keep getting this massive overfitting.\n What I have done is apply regularization constraints like L1 and L2 and limitate the number of max_samples, the number of trees, etc, in order to get a lower accuracy on the train test and not overfit. Now I get around 90% accuracy in the train set and almost 80% on the test set (it decreases too ).
