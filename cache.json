I was relatively picky, but was consistently receiving offers (and able to negotiate).\n The one I landed on ended up laying me off after a few months and since then the search has been a lot harder. So far out of 19 places I've screened with (or been sent an assessment from) I've had 8 ghosts and 7 rejections. The feedback has been inconsistent, but more so than last year I am hearing back that they just went with another candidate or that others were farther along in the process. This is particularly distressing for me since I am way less picky than I was and having a hard time with positions I feel I am over-qualified for.\n Are others experiencing the same thing? Is this just a combination of more people looking after lay-offs and fewer open positions?\n    submitted by    /u/Illustrious-Mind9435  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi there\n What do you guys think about using a ML model to find statistical differences between populations? Let me explain my particular case:\n I have a dataset of 56 cells (more to come) coming from 4 different patients (target variable) with different illness conditions, each cell has ~22 numerical features and our aim is to find differences among the patients (one being the control). Since looking for correlations between features and statistical differences become too overwhelming and tedious, I thought of training a interpretable ML model and use it to discover which properties have the cell of each patient, There is no intention/value to make future predictions. The 2 best performing models were Logistic Regresion and a Random Forest with AOC > 0.9 and F1-score > 0.9 (trained with the whole dataset an 10-fold CV). Afterwards I use the SHAP-values and permutation feature importance to see which features and values intervals are more characteristic for each patient. Although there is a bit of discrepancy between the order of the most important features given by LogReg and RForest, there is good agreement for the most important features at each case. I found this method superior to PCA since some features add little to the global variance but are important for a particular patient.\n This is exploratory research, so the main question to answer with this approach is: is the good performing model a good way of finding whether cells coming from different illnesses are different?\n What do you think about this practice? have you used it in your work?\n Cheers¡\n    submitted by    /u/Ale_Campoy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basically the \"too mathematical for software developers/data engineers, too much code for maths/science folks\" category- you know the gist.\n What I have noticed is that Data Science either gets treated as a traditional software development team or a BI team. Both of which I think are quite bad. Of course there's a surge of MLOps which is \"standardising\" shipping and maintaining ML in production, but it doesn't focus too much on actually developing the models. \n Software Development treatment: Here you lose a lot of flexibility in experimentation, research, model exploration and frankly the failure rate in Data Science projects is relatively high compared to other fields in tech (some things just can't be solved with ML/maths, or simply it is not worth it). Normal software development timelines don't make sense in most cases especially since you rely a lot on backend/data engineers/frontend/product before you even start a project.\n BI treatment: Well you have 500 scripts, notebooks, analysis spread all around you. There's very little code reviews, basic software development procedures, it's basically the wild west 🤠. The infrastructure gets built by people who have very little clue (or time) about any of this. Retraining, deployment are a nightmare. Whatever benefit you get in actually have in building the models, you surely loose all of it as soon as your work gets into production. \n How do your teams function and structure the work around this? Do you feel this is a bit chaotic or am I the only one? What tools are you using?
