          "description": "Comic Code is a monospaced adaptation of Comic Sans. Designed specifically for programming, which is a corner of typography that involves intensive typing that feels more akin to handwriting than typesetting, this typeface took inspirations from the friendly characteristics and low-resolution legibility of Comic Sans. It is an unapologetic admittance of the positives of the source design, and a literal manifestation of “code like nobody’s watching”. Comic Code only takes inspiration from Comic Sans and was drawn entirely from scratch, in case you are wondering.\nComments",

Everyone there is accountant and a few economics background. But no one with a statistics or math background to my knowledge. \n So basically they have given me a list of every audit they have done for the last ten years. And want me to find a way to help them choose vouchers to audit that are more likely to be inappropriate. \n I have a bunch of data, the vendor, the payments amount, how long did they look at the voucher before they approved it. And everything you can think of. I just have no idea the best method to use. I was just thinking of doing logistic regression, but I don’t know if you guys have any better suggestions\n    submitted by    /u/CaptainVJ  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey! Quick introduction, I am 17 years old and currently in highschool looking to graduate probably within march or April. I've been exploring my future career options and what stuck out to me in particular was data science/ analysis. Now again a quick run down on what I did during the last 2 years, I opted for subjects that were related to commerce and computer science (so economics, Business, CS etc). I actually have a particular interest in computers and coding and so along with the python and SQL we learned in school I also know the basics of C++ and Java. My advanced math skills (calculus, integration etc) arent the best however, I do seem to do well in statistics and probability which I assume is pretty important for such a career.\n ​\n Now coming to my main question, do you think Data Science is a viable career? From what I can see, it seems almost too perfect. But I would like more insight. Is there something I am missing? Is the pay as good as other IT jobs? Is the demand for Data scientists high or will it get/remain high in the future once I get out of college? Is the job any fun (my biggest fear is ending up with a career that I dont enjoy or is depressing as hell)?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/AbelRaijin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "How do you deal with changing features in a regression problem? I imagine this is quite common in a product/marketplace company. Here's an example:\n Let's say the task is predicting car prices for an online marketplace, a value you'd like to present to someone about to list their car on the site. You can use your marketplace's historic sales as a training set. However, as the marketplace evolved, more features were added to the car object, and maybe some stopped being used. E.g., in the early phase of the marketplace, you had 3 features: car model, year, and color. Then maybe later on the company stopped collecting color, and instead now collect MPG and transmission type. So now you have 4 features on the newer dataset: car model, year, MPG, and transmission type. And so on and so on...did you just impute the missing values? not use features that are missing data? Split test/train to only reflect current features? Is it a constant game of cat and mouse keeping up with the fresh features?\n    submitted by    /u/foreignparent  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've narrowed down my offers to two different companies which I will briefly describe.\n Company 1: Large Fortune 500 Banking/Credit firm, located on the east coast, with a high 'prestige' name. Pure Data Analytics Internship (Dashboards, Reporting, SQL, Automation, ETL, etc).\n Company 2: Medium Sized Car Automotive group, located near my current university, offering a pure Data Science Internship (Focus in pricing, loans and credit modeling)\n Ideally I would love to work in Fintech moving forward which is one of the main reasons Company 1 stands out. However moving to Company 1 would be a pain regarding location as I would have to travel across the nation.\n Additionally the experience I could gain at Company 2 seems great, there business model relies heavily on the data science team to develop production level models. Further I've met the team I would be working with and could tell I could learn a ton from them.\n I am aware that the prestige I could gain from Company 1 would be immense, however I am weary to chose the role just because I'm worried it will only lead to more data analyst internships down the line (which I would ideally like to avoid).\n Further, I'm very passionate about ML/econometrics/statistics and although I understand and appreciate the power of pure analytics, I'm worried I could see myself getting bored in a strictly analytics based role.\n I would really appreciate any input or thoughts!\n    submitted by    /u/fleekpanda416  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "AI, another version of the i-life. At least Apple put i-first. Actually, how about anti-i-life? Here, following the operation left to right, you’re operated on first. No thanks, not interested. In many ways your intelligence is already anti (negated) by those with power over you. AI represents a terminal point of the technocracy. AI is the antithesis of sovereign individual intelligence.\n Technology platforms are committing entire categories to AI, medium included. AI is all around us, as if being forced onto us. It honestly feels coercive. We are in the middle of a bubble right now, well, maybe more like a quantum foam. We’ve been automating processes since the industrial revolution, automation is nothing new. You have nothing to worry about, well maybe your job if you work in tech (I’m sure you’ve seen the news).\n Do you honestly think all of this has arisen out of the pure intellectual curiosity of the masses? No, this obsession is being forced upon us by those seeking to ride this wave of investment dollars as long as they can. People are being paid to write about AI. The goal is to captivate the mind while convincing you there is simply no point in resisting. They seem to suggest you should take your own intellect and multiply it by negative one. The message appears something like: “Trust it because you’re not even intelligent enough to trust in your own intelligence.”\n Tech is stagnating and the Metaverse is gasping for breath. We are in the beginning stages of a re-quantization of human prioritization. Surely you’ve heard of The Great Reset. Well, what’s the point in resetting a system only to get the same outcome? I think we need A Great Re-quantization. A movement of individual thought.\n    submitted by    /u/PracticalChicken1  \n [link]   [comments]",
