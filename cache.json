It prints a URL in the build log and waits for secrets to be entered using a browser. Once entered, the workflow continues, and secrets can be used in future steps.\nThe latest release of \"eslint-plugin-react\" to the npm registry used a one-time password (OTP) from a GitHub Actions workflow!\nhttps://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/actions/ru...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33884424\nPoints: 45\n# Comments: 9",

My work is mainly in Python and SQL, and while proficient in both I would definitely like to spend time upskilling in these and related areas. I have a company allowance of $500 per calendar year to spend on professional development (think online classes, certs, etc). My question is this:\n If you had $500 to spend right now on upskilling, what would you spend it on?\n I currently have my eye on a year subscription to Coursera Plus, since they offer access to 90% of Coursera courses with certifications. The only reason I am hesitant on this is because it excludes some of the more desirable DS courses to me (namely the IBM courses). \n Any guidance will be very helpful!\n    submitted by    /u/HaroldFlower  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This weekend millions of people rushed to check the Chat_GPT. This fueled many discussions regarding the job security of the future. People like Paul Krugman started talking about the future of job and massive job loss as the result of the AI which will be disruptive of course. And this time unless previously that the job loss was happening in the low skilled job categories, it will happen to the skilled workers. Any thoughts about what to do and how to persuade a new job specially after knowing that data analysis related jobs will be very vulnerable to AI technologies. \n “It's true that as AI and machine learning technologies continue to advance, they are likely to have an impact on many different fields, including data science. However, it's important to remember that while AI may automate some tasks and make certain job roles obsolete, it is also likely to create new job opportunities in areas such as AI research, development, and implementation.\n In terms of what job you should pursue in the future, it's difficult to say for certain. The best thing to do is to stay up-to-date on the latest developments in AI and machine learning, and consider pursuing education and training in these areas. This will give you the skills and knowledge you need to adapt to the changing job market and take advantage of the new opportunities that are likely to arise.\n It's also important to remember that there will always be a need for human expertise and creativity in many fields, including data science. So, even as AI continues to advance, there will likely still be plenty of opportunities for skilled data scientists who are able to think critically, solve complex problems, and apply their expertise to new challenges.”\n This is the Chat_GPT’s answer to what to do as data scientist question. 😀\n    submitted by    /u/WeirdDiscipline1862  \n [link]   [comments]",

A few years ago I grew disillusioned with the structural engineering career because of the poor WLB and high liability. I am still working in engineering because I have bills to pay. In school I had enjoyed the few programming courses I had taken and I started looking into a move into tech. I have found that Data Science could be a good fit for me because it involves some coding, statistical analysis, and in some cases can be tangential to engineering depending on the role. My background includes a BS and MS where I analyzed a large dataset from sensors as part of my thesis. I used Matlab to help clean and organize the data, and performed more standard bayesian statistical methods as part of my research. Since graduating I have studied python and have taken a few university classes in CS to get my feet wet as wet. I am feeling a bit lost for how to proceed from here. I am wondering what would be the most sure fire way to get into data science regardless of cost. I find that having more formal classes help me get the fundamentals and then applying them in personal projects helps solidify things. Would something like a DS masters be useful? A few universities near me also offer post graduate certificates that are around 12-16 credit hours that would help me learn more. Any advice would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/lpnumb  \n [link]   [comments]",

Started as a personal banker then a Client associate (working with a financial advisor ) and now I am a business analyst (started 3 months ago). I'm assigned to 4 projects/teams and heavily use SQL and Excel for these projects. In addition to my work experience, I decided to go back to school for my second bachelors in data science. My classes taught me the basics of python data analysis, Power BI, tableau, and machine learning. I have a few more courses left until I graduate next summer.\n Should I include projects on my resume? is it needed since I technically have data analysis experience with SQL and Excel? \n I was thinking about including one of my Python projects from school since I don't have \"job experience\" with Python. and maybe one tableau project since I enjoy it more than Power BI.

          "description": "Hi! I'm not experienced in data analysis and was wondering if I could find ideas on how to solve a problem from here. Basically, I want to compare the accuracy of two predictors. Me and my flatmate started watching a reality show and we're trying to guess the order in which the participants are eliminated. We both ranked the participants in the order we think they'll be eliminated. I need a tool for comparing which of us did better in the end and it needs to be accurate because the stakes are very high (we made a bet). I guess I could do Spearman's correlation but is there a better way to compare our accuracies? We agreed that you get additional points for correctly guessing 1st and 2nd place. Otherwise I think it would make sense to assign points for each correct guess. But what if neither of us get any placing exactly right, is there then a way to model how close to accurate we were? I hope this makes sense. I was hoping to use Matlab for this (just because I'm trying to learn it). Many thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/jojovaan  \n [link]   [comments]",

Shouldn't be hard 😅😅😅😅\n \"In this game, players get to pretend they're tough soldiers and shoot at stuff. You'll travel to exciting locations like \"desert\" and \"snowy mountain\" and use a plethora of weapons that you'll never actually get to use in real life. This game is the perfect way for armchair warriors to live out their military fantasies without having to leave the comfort of their own homes. You'll get to run around virtual battlefields and shoot at people without any of the pesky consequences that come with real-life warfare. And if you're not satisfied with just pretending to be a soldier, you can also team up with other delusional individuals in multiplayer mode and compete to see who's the best at pretending to be a soldier. It's like a never-ending game of make-believe, but with guns.\n It's just a bunch of pixelated violence that serves no purpose other than to desensitize players and make them think that war is a fun and exciting game. The so-called \"single-player campaign\" is just a series of repetitive missions that lack any sort of plot or character development. And the multiplayer mode is even worse, full of obnoxious players who think they're better than everyone else just because they have a few hours of practice under their belts. All in all, this game is a mindless and pointless exercise in virtual aggression, and I can't believe people actually spend their time and money on it.\n But why not give it a try?

          "description": "Hi everyone, I'm new into the AI world but I got a strong technical background since I work as software developer 10+ years. \n I'm basically trying to find what AI technology should I use to filter a large set of data, where I have a collection of 50k resumes (they're uploaded in PDF then converted to text), and I want to input something like: \"What are the 10 most relevant candidates with at least 10 years of JavaScript experience, fluent english, and previously worked at some FAANG?\" \n ​\n I already looked into openai but the problem is they don't allow to you upload a large set of data upfront like I need. So my questions are:\n ​\n - Is AI the right technology to do what I want?\n - If so, what are the apis/techs I could look into to accomplish this?\n ​\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/giopetris  \n [link]   [comments]",
