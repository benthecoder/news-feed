          "description": "Last month I asked[0] what could be done with an old iPad; the responses led me to discover Alfred Home Security[0] and It's exactly what I was looking for. The winning feature being, you can repurpose any old iOS device as a camera.\nI have since used the app with 2 old iPads, and an iPhone 7 Plus. Works better than I expect, really nicely done app.\nThe motion detection is spot-on. I've been mostly using this to see what our new very shy kitten is up to since we've only seen him twice in 5 weeks; basically he's impossible to find during the day and only comes out to play after we're asleep. The videos are super fun / cute, and it's nice to see he's having fun and in good health! [3]\nAlfred Security also make a impressive, very inexpensive camera ($34 US, 1080P, night vision, 130 degree viewing angle and easy to mount). I just received 3 of the 4.\nTLDR: last month I wanted to know what was the best use for old iPads /iOS devices, and I've since discovered Alfred Home Security[1].\nSupported Devices[2]:\nAndroid: Android 4.4 or above (For a better experience, operating systems above Android 5 are highly recommended)\niOS: iOS 10 or above\nOriginal post:\n[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34165418\n[1] https://alfred.camera/\n[2] https://alfredcamera.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039755...\n[3] https://alfred.camera/tv/9IHo74Mj5\n* I have nothing to do, nor any affiliation with Alfred other than pay for and use their products.\n* Original Post is locked; I couldn't post this information there.\n* Updated with devices / link, and kitty video link (this is off an old iPad, not the Alfred Camera), and formatting.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34392783\nPoints: 90\n# Comments: 50",

The result is SaaS AI Tools, a growing collection of 400+ generative AI tools to help supercharge your creativity and take your business to the next level.\n Also, to differentiate a bit - I've added another section that involves a feed of daily AI articles, so you can keep up-to-date on the top AI headlines. This is how I'm personally keeping up with all the AI stuff today. I'll be adding more tools and news sources soon.\n I've launched the website on Product Hunt and would appreciate any of your support 🙏\n    submitted by    /u/Hairy_Milk8431  \n [link]   [comments]",
