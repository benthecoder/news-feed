It saves much time while working with LLMs.\n If you are an industrial researcher or application developer, you probably have worked with GPT-3 apis. A common challenge when utilizing LLMs such as #GPT-3 and BLOOM is their tendency to produce uncontrollable & unstructured outputs, making it difficult to use them for various NLP tasks and applications. \n To address this, we developed Promptify, a library that allows for the use of LLMs to solve NLP problems, including Named Entity Recognition, Binary Classification, Multi-Label Classification, and Question-Answering and return a python object for easy parsing to construct additional applications on top of GPT-n based models.\n Features 🚀 \n  \n🧙‍♀️ NLP Tasks (NER, Binary Text Classification, Multi-Label Classification etc.) in 2 lines of code with no training data required\n 🔨 Easily add one-shot, two-shot, or few-shot examples to the prompt\n ✌ Output is always provided as a Python object (e.g. list, dictionary) for easy parsing and filtering\n 💥 Custom examples and samples can be easily added to the prompt\n 💰 Optimized prompts to reduce OpenAI token costs\n \n ​\n  \nGITHUB: https://github.com/promptslab/Promptify\n Examples: https://github.com/promptslab/Promptify/tree/main/examples\n For quick demo -> Colab\n  \nTry out and share your feedback.

I liked learning and knowing the fundamentals.\n When I was doing my PhD and applying statistical techniques, I similarly liked trying to calculate certain things myself by hand in simple scenarios (such as a t-test with not too many data points), rather than always using pre-programmed functions. I had a lot more time to dedicate to learning and checking things made sense.\n In my work now as an analyst, whilst I get L&D time, I just don’t have the time anymore to thoroughly check over things and make sure they make sense. I just have to trust that the R functions are doing what I expect. I have to trust that my chi-squared test is doing what I think, for example. Or that my logistic regression is producing a reasonable output. \n I can’t remember the last time I got a pen and paper out and had to differentiate or integrate something, or multiply matrices, or work out the Fourier transform of a function.\n Maybe I’m just being nostalgic and having imposter syndrome but it feels like I’m slowly forgetting all of that underlying maths, and that I’ll end up at the point where I can do basic statistical programming and nothing more.\n    submitted by    /u/JLane1996  \n [link]   [comments]",

They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, free of economic pressures.\n The fear is that OpenAI’s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.\n However, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.\n To understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!\n To appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let’s first look at Sam Altman’s backstory.\n …",

          "description": "Hi all, \n I am trying to find the best multidimensional combination of parameters for an application based on a given metric by using bayesian optimisation to search the parameter space and efficiently find the most optimal parameters with the fewest number of evaluations. The model gives some sets of parameters, some that it has a high prediction of the metric, and others it has high uncertainty about. \n These 2-300 outputs per cycle are then experimentally validated, and the accumulated results fed back into the model to get a better set of parameters for the next iterations for a total of about 6 iterations (12-1500 data points total) . The search space is large, and there are a limited amount of iterations that can be performed. \n Because of this, I need to evaluate several surrogate models on their performance within this search space. I need to evaluate the search efficiency (how quickly can each one find the most optimal candidates e.g one will take 3 cycles, the other 8, other 20 etc) and the theoretical proportion of the search space that each model can search given the same data e.g 20% of the search space given 3% experimentally validated data from the search space.\n I am using the BoTorch library to build the bayesian optimisation model. I also already have a set of real world experimental data from different cycles from the first model I tried. \n I would like to know how to go about evaluating these models for the search efficiency and design space uncertainty, any thoughts are welcome. \n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/ogola89  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "What I've used so far\n So far, I have used some AI tools for text generation, where you give it a prompt, set a tone, maybe do some little configuration of what you want, and it gives you text options. I have also used some online tools using Google Colab. Though my experience was not smooth maybe due to a slower internet speed I have where I live. All the more reason I'm exploring a locally-operated machine as I have a 3x GPU workstation that's not being used (I used it for Folding@Home but had some issues).\n I am not looking for the level that OpenAI's GPT-3.5 is in.\n What I am looking for:\n I wish to use it for assisted writing purposes for an internet cafe I operate. I can put together a workstation with 3-4 graphics cards, let's say. I currently have three spare GTX 1660 Ti from my home as well. Is this sufficient for smaller tasks using some sort of open source or free transformer language model like GPT-J or Kobold AI? I'm okay with slower results. Mainly, I wish to set it up and help others create small form content, automated text on some topic, blogs, maybe some social media captions, school assignments, etc. for personal uses as this will be a shared workstation.\n If there is a workflow but one that requires vastly superior computation power, I'm okay with a text generator with limited datasets and speed.\n Also, what is the possibility of custom training? None of the people using it will want to write code, for example. I've seen datasets that have a vast amount of training from Stack Exchange, for example. Is there a model where I can feed custom datasets, or remove the Stack Exchange dataset and input another?\n    submitted by    /u/SATArisers  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've just been wondering why people have been able to develop AI models such as GANs and more recently diffusion models that are so good at creating images but music generation has remained somewhat stagnant.\n From what I understand, there are two ways AI are generally trained on music: through MIDI files and using raw audio. The MIDI files are probably easier for the AI to work with but there's massive loss of relevant data that an AI would need to really become proficient in music generation. On the other hand, AIs trained on the raw audio tend to produce somewhat fuzzy audio that often includes what sounds like nearly distinguishable lyrics. I'm personally convinced the latter is the method that will be universally used in the future, but it clearly has a long way to go. So does anyone have any insights regarding why it's straggling a bit?\n Perhaps it's because software like Stable Diffusion are piggybacking off the image recognition advancements that have been in very high demand the past couple decades? Perhaps music is, in fact, a more complicated or more strict artform and our human minds are biased to think that these two tasks should be roughly equivalent in difficulty? It's certainly not due to a lack of data to train on, so maybe we just don't have a model that's really suited to analyzing and imitating music.\n    submitted by    /u/No-Phrase1116  \n [link]   [comments]",
