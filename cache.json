          "description": "So I had previously set up my home server with SSH on a high port, and did the port forwarding thing on the firewall so that I can SSH into this system from elsewhere on the Internet.  It worked fine for months.\nAnd then, it stopped working. The router didn’t have a software update as far as I can see. I re-checked everything, but I just can’t initiate a connection to the server from elsewhere on the Internet. It seems like it is filtered somewhere in the ISP’s network.  I can, and possibly will switch ISPs, but in the mean time, I’m looking at other technical options. Though we use the other main ISP for work, and their uptime in the last couple years has been… less than stellar.\nOne option is obviously rent a VPS, and set up a VPN or something, and have the home server connect to that at startup.  I can and have done that in the past, but even a low-cost VPS is $10 USD per month.\nSome of the VPN providers out there have relatively low-cost multi-year deals, so I was looking at one of those. But it wasn’t clear if any of them supported what I wanted to do. I don’t really need to watch Netflix from a different region, I just want access to my server remotely.\nI just wanted to see if anyone else is doing something like this.  Thanks!",

Essentially it allows allows you to really quickly and easily share and edit text snippets on a classic Macintosh. I've tested the software on System 2.0 through System 7.6.1, but it should work on all PPC and 68k Macintoshes running up to MacOS 9.2.2 assuming they have a modem serial port available.\nIn addition to the github repository, I wrote up a blog post here: https://henlin.net/2022/10/02/Introducing-FocusedEdit-for-cl...  outlining how to get up and running. Both the repo and the blog post have a demo gif to help explain exactly what FocusedEdit does as well as how it works.\nIf you have any questions or decide to try it out on your Macintosh or in an emulator, let me know!

I have now joined a startup for a bit less than a year, we are working on building a new type of AI computing devices that could go beyond Moore's law, where I am basically working on the integration of the chip with machine learning frameworks.\n What I don't like about my experience is that it is:\n  \nIt is very niche, most companies seems to be looking for a more traditional experience\n No real experience with cloud infrastructure/deployment\n I never got to actually do \"data science\" professionally\n  \nIn a not so distant future, I would like to go back to where I am coming from which is near Geneva (Switzerland). There are a few job opportunities in the ML/Data Science world there, but not that many.Data Science opportunities also seems to be better there than machine learning ones.\n But anyway, my point is really that I am scared of closing myself a lot of doors because of the path I took.Am I just freaking out or is it really something that can become problematic in the long run?What can I do and what should I do to counter that?\n PS: Maybe worth to mention but I have good software engineering skills (I learned coding in C at an early age).\n    submitted by    /u/Outrageous-Archer-92  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, ML is almost always only valuable when it’s deployed. And this is the work of ML Engineers. \n If you work at a startup or some legacy company that’s trying to catch up with the times (SAP, CapOne, Walmart, etc) you might be tasked as both a DS and MLE. \n But don’t over-optimize for ML knowledge. If you want to be an MLE, that’s great! But you also need to study system design and data structures & algorithms (leet code.) \n Otherwise, if you really want to get into DS, master SQL, statistics (full spectrum of interpretable regression models, not just slap a T-test on everything) and build up your product sense/business intuitions. \n As a DS, your job will be understanding the risks, opportunities and patterns present in data, not deploying some computer vision DL model.\n    submitted by    /u/Greedy_Comfortable73  \n [link]   [comments]",

From what I can tell with some research the most popular recommendations I've seen are:\n  \nStatistical Inference- at first glance this book feels way above my level, like I can probably work out some things with effort, but I'll probably need another book to fill in the gaps.\n All of Statistics- Looks solid as a reference for someone who's taken way more stats than I have, super concise but super dry read.\n Mathematical Statistics with Applications(Wackerly)- This is one that feels like could be a possibility\n Introduction to Probability(Blitz)- This feels like the other contender\n  \nSo far books 3 and 4 seem like best options, is there anything else I'm missing or votes one way or another?\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/425trafficeng  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’ve recently become very interested in the history of AI, and I’ve been reading a few articles as well as the book “A Brief History of AI” by Michael Woolridge for a good primer on the subject. I’ve decided to collect some of my thoughts in a very short essay.\n First, I want to discuss the term “AI” itself. In some sense it feels like a marketing term. It’s a very loaded term, and any time it is used, there is almost always a more precise designation that could be used (machine learning, heuristic search, etc.). Of course any of these more precise terms could further be broken down with even more precision, but I think that when we group so many applications under the umbrella of “AI”, invalid associations are made. For example, if fears about slaughterbots create a negative bias towards …",

I love scifi and stuff as well it all got me thinking about where this is headed and I wanted to know how long it may realistically take till we get there. I could see a world where you could feed a neural network all the episodes of Seinfeld and it could give you an infinite number of new episodes, all rendered in photo realistic detail. Could be any show, King of Queens, Everybody Loves Raymond, Family Guy, Community. \n You could also have an ai write and generate shows based on current trends with no input from human beings. All the voice work and acting would he generated. Then the show could morph and change in real time based on reception and feedback. \n So how long until those things are realistically possible, or at least close?
