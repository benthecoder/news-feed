          "description": "So I had previously set up my home server with SSH on a high port, and did the port forwarding thing on the firewall so that I can SSH into this system from elsewhere on the Internet.  It worked fine for months.\nAnd then, it stopped working. The router didn’t have a software update as far as I can see. I re-checked everything, but I just can’t initiate a connection to the server from elsewhere on the Internet. It seems like it is filtered somewhere in the ISP’s network.  I can, and possibly will switch ISPs, but in the mean time, I’m looking at other technical options. Though we use the other main ISP for work, and their uptime in the last couple years has been… less than stellar.\nOne option is obviously rent a VPS, and set up a VPN or something, and have the home server connect to that at startup.  I can and have done that in the past, but even a low-cost VPS is $10 USD per month.\nSome of the VPN providers out there have relatively low-cost multi-year deals, so I was looking at one of those. But it wasn’t clear if any of them supported what I wanted to do. I don’t really need to watch Netflix from a different region, I just want access to my server remotely.\nI just wanted to see if anyone else is doing something like this.  Thanks!",

          "description": "Hi,\nI'm a solo dev and for a while I've been trying to get Microsoft to add AAAA records to their artefact repositories.\nRequest:\nPlease post a request / encouragement for microsoft to finally get this done at: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7435\nContext: \nI'd like to be able to use IP v6 only servers to collect artefacts and do builds etc..\nIt seems ludicrous to me that this still isn't supported. Given that IP v4 is increasingly scarce and that some countries are even starting to phase it out entirely.\nWhy not take the time to add a few AAAA records?\nThis should be simple?\nAlternatively:\nDoes anyone have a better approach for a lone dev to accomplish this? Without relying on Microsoft to take action?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33045421\nPoints: 15\n# Comments: 4",

          "description": "I often read in blog posts and stuff that Data Scientist focus on prediction while staticians focus on inference or explanation. Basically Data Science doesn´t care why a model works as long as model predicts with a minimum of accuracy? Staticians do care why a model works and are interested in effect size, p values etc of variables in the model?\n I don´t understand why there is this distinction. If I have a better understanding of the impotance of variables in my model I will have more faith in the future predictability of my model. So explanation improves prediction in this sense. I think this is reasonable, because lots of statistics is about validating theoretical models and these models often want to predict the future.\n    submitted by    /u/AwkwardlyDistributed  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey All,\n I'm starting a masters in CS (OMSCS) this upcoming January with the goal of prepping myself for data science. I’m looking to bring my stats knowledge up to par to understand texts like Deep Learning- Goodfellow, PRML, ML A Probabilistic Perspective, etc. \n My background is civil engineering and in undergrad took Calc 1-3, Diff Eq, Linear Algebra and a non-calc based stats 101 type class. When I got my masters in Civil-Transportation I took some stats modeling classes that covered regression (linear, logistic, poisson, negative binomial, etc) pretty heavily using R+NLOGIT.\n At this point my stats knowledge is pretty disjointed and feel like I dont have a solid understanding of the fundamentals. From what I can tell with some research the most popular recommendations I've seen are:\n  \nStatistical Inference- at first glance this book feels way above my level, like I can probably work out some things with effort, but I'll probably need another book to fill in the gaps.\n All of Statistics- Looks solid as a reference for someone who's taken way more stats than I have, super concise but super dry read.\n Mathematical Statistics with Applications(Wackerly)- This is one that feels like could be a possibility\n Introduction to Probability(Blitz)- This feels like the other contender\n  \nSo far books 3 and 4 seem like best options, is there anything else I'm missing or votes one way or another?\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/425trafficeng  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, elbow method and Yellow bricks recommended 5 clusters, \n I've tried three clustering methods:\n  \nKMeans with all features combined\n Gaussian Mixture Model - I selected this method given the high density of frequency cohorts\n Naive KMeans - take the RFM columns only, and run KMeans for each feature alone. Then find the average of each cluster, and score manually to bucket the clusters into High, Mid, Low (for example, a cluster with low R, high F, and high M gets to be the High Value customer cluster)\n  \nI want to ask to ask if there's anyone with Customer Analytics that I can consult with on whether there's a benefit to each approach, or if you have recommendations on a different approach\n    submitted by    /u/forbiscuit  \n [link]   [comments]",
