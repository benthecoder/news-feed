They asked me find three trends and a visual within this GitHub repo except the GitHub repo that is meant to function as a relational database has very poor documentation on how the files fit together and are intended to be used. Really there’s absolutely nothing on how they fit. It’s mad.\n On top of that, there are dozens of historical versions of files with no real information on which version contains what and why. Kind of like they just dumped every attempt to clean the file into one place. There’s also many files that exist in isolation meaning they don’t join onto any other dataset at all, some files join onto specific files outside of the main dataset as well, but there is not documentation on it.\n Then the icing on the cake - it has to be done in tableau and they are asking for any additional datasets I can think to help in the analysis. \n Their time estimate for this task?

          "description": "I’m a college student studying data science, and I’m looking to switch from Windows to Apple. I’m considering the M1 Air, M1 pro (13 inch), and the M1 pro (14 inch). I would get all of these computers with 16 GB RAM. The price difference between each model is about $300-400.\n My concern with the Air is that there is no fan, so running long models will strain the computer. My concern with the 13 inch Pro is that I don’t love the Touch Bar, but I feel like I could get used to it — is the 14 inch pro really worth it for this difference?\n I’m asking this here as I am hoping somebody will know what is required for data science. How powerful does my computer need to be? I feel as though the 13 inch pro could be a good middle ground of performance and cost, but I’m not sure.\n    submitted by    /u/NewDawn729  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Long story short, my current job as a data scientist is not fulfilling because I don’t think my company is providing any real value to the world or people who need it. I feel like I’m just getting paid to go through the motions and make the rich even richer while not really making a difference at all.\n When I say companies with admirable missions or purposes, I honestly mean a lot of things — for me, some of the first places my mind wanders are like climate research or medical research. But of course, there are so many different ways a company can have an admirable mission and I am open to any considerations anyone might have.\n Not sure if this kind of post is permitted, so if there is a better place for me to post this then please let me know and I will kindly remove it from here and post it there. Any advice pertinent to my question is greatly appreciated, and any other general advice is welcomed as well. Thank you all.\n    submitted by    /u/runboba  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys. Not sure if this is the correct place to post this, and might be a bit of a noob question, but I would be really greatful if someone could point me in the right direction.\n I have a small dataset that has values between roughly +-20, each with it's own time point. What I'm trying is to do is represent a trend in time of these values. problem is, each consecutive value may rapidly jump from, say, +15 to -10. What would be the best way to represent a kind of trendline in time of these values?\n What I've tried so far and I've been using for now is for each point on the graph raking the average of the last n values, with bigger n resulting in bigger smoothing. I've also thought about taking the last n values and plotting a projected future value based on those past values, but not sure how to accomplish that for n>2, as I'm limited to excel/google sheets formulas for now.\n If anyone has any resources on this or knows a better way to achieve my goal, any answers would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n EDIT: this is a hobby project, nothing professional, so any hacky solutions or workarounds are also welcome :)\n    submitted by    /u/GameOfShadows  \n [link]   [comments]",
