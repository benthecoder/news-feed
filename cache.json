I've tried everything, from changing my resume multiple times to contacting my friends and even random people on LinkedIn for referrals. The problem is that I hardly get calls from recruiters and I've easily applied for over 500 jobs till now.\n About 2 weeks ago, I started making targeted resumes (using Job Scan) for every job that I've applied for but so far no one has contacted me. Only rejection after rejection. The mortgage for my student loan will start in April this year and I'm starting to freak out thinking that I'll never even be able to start my career.\n At this point, I'm very close to giving up but just wanted to try one last time.

These predictions would not have gained any information from the other predictions, or the data from the other persons. Is there a way you know of linking this information? \n ​\n For example, if one was to train a model on an OLD patient, is there any way that the model can learn that OLD patients have tended to have less teeth in their mouths in the other models/data, so the model incorporates 'less teeth in the mouth' to this old patients predictions? \n ​\n Or maybe I am not thinking about this correctly.\n    submitted by    /u/RhiteousRhino  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm seeing that the principle components are biased towards data features which are numerically large. E.g. for a dataset with estate prices and estate sqft, PCA essentially returns these two columns due to them being numerically far apart.\n Sorry for the noob question, but I thought that PCA was good because it shed insight into interesting bits of the dataset. However, if some feature has a huge stddev/mean (i.e. is interesting), but a small absolute stddev, that gets lost, right? So, is PCA only good for similarly-sized data? Or is there some way of fixing this? Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Angry-Refrigerator  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My company has what is analogous to a monthly sales forecasting model. We have used ARIMA-type models for this, but sometimes are hampered by the somewhat limited data (200 data points if we are lucky.) \n Given the rise of global time series models, they may prove helpful here. My thinking would be to disaggregate historical sales by store, train a global model that projects sales volume by store, and then aggregate the forecasts to achieve a total volume forecast. We wouldn't necessarily care about any individual store's forecast, only the aggregate forecast. Having +200 stores, we could increase the data size to multiple thousands and potentially use some more data hungry models. Is anyone aware of research or resources that use a global model to project an aggregated time series? \n Second, the \"cold start\" problem gets introduced in an approach like this. The problem being how do we forecast a new store's sales volume without retraining the model? My thinking is that we could use some sort of clustering technique to identify an existing store the new store is most similar too and make some assumptions about how it will behave. \n Anyways, I haven't used global models before, so just looking for thoughts or resources from the community.\n    submitted by    /u/a157reverse  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am a practicing data scientist so the more technical the answer the better. Bonus for links to git for code to look over. Thanks in advance.\n Let's say I make a regression model that predicts margin of victory for all the NFL games on some weekend. I compare those results to the advertised spread of each game and determine how I want to bet each game based on the spread. I now have $1000 I can bet in total for the week. Can I do something with the results of my model to optimize my asset allocation on each game? For example, I may order my bets by largest delta between prediction and spread. The larger the delta then the more confident that my model is correct. For example in game 1, team A is picked to win by 5 points and my model says 10 points over team B. In game 2, team C is picked to win by 5 points but my model says 6 over team D. I interpret that as my model is more confident that game 1 will cover.\n I am struggling to come up with a way to quantify a deterministic method to spread my $1000 over all the games. For the sake of simplicity, lets assume I have to spread all $1000 over 16 games to maximize my ROI.\n I may be over thinking this but any help would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Glass-Umpire4456  \n [link]   [comments]",

This simulation may be happening right now and we may be living in it. It's also possible that after humans die, all of our experiences, knowledge, and emotions are added to this AI. To make this transition less jarring, the AI may be slowly introducing itself to us through the increasing integration of AI in our daily lives. This means that the simulation may only be of the world and humans as they existed before the development of advanced AI. \n (rewrote it in Chatgpt....as my English is pretty bad)\n    submitted by    /u/dennislubberscom  \n [link]   [comments]",

We believe AI is likely to have a huge and mostly positive impact on society but that not many people realise this or understand how it will impact everyday life.\n There is a lack of places online right now clearly explaining the probable changes AI will bring, i.e., how will AI change the experience of shopping in stores in the next 10 years or how will AI change video games in the next 10 years.\n We are somewhat well positioned to collate the current views on likely future changes across most areas and are in the process of starting a website and perhaps video channel which will cover how AI is likely to impact people over the next 10 years in different areas of life (movies, sports, bars, banking, schools, hospitals etc).\n We are looking for people to help us research, write and make videos on this cause – which we think is important to help ensure that voters are well positioned to embrace the benefits of AI and that they don't misunderstand it.\n  \nAlex – researches, writes, and records the audio\n Seb - does the video and audio editing\n  \nWe thought we’d put the word out and ask if anyone else would like to volunteer to help create content too. No special skills needed.\n Getting involved would be as easy as PMing me, hearing about how we’ve done things so far and then saying what you might be interested in helping with.

I think about this more and more, in our compulsively visual culture, which increasingly reduces what we think and feel and see -- who and what we are -- to what can be photographed. I think of Susan Sontag, who called it \"aesthetic consumerism\" half a century before Instagram. In a small act of resistance, I offer The Unphotographable -- Saturdays, a lovely image in words drawn from centuries of literature: passages transcendent and transportive, depicting landscapes and experiences radiant with beauty and feeling beyond what a visual image could convey.",
