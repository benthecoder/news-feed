I saw all the performer use SSD, faster CNN, or Yolo with resnet or inception as the backbone. But their accuracy can hardly reach up to 65 %. I read some excellent journal papers based on road crack detection. Most of the recent paper's authors are doing semantic segmentation on various crack datasets and got perfect accuracy. They are using unet with an attention mechanism. My professor told me to classify besides detection, which is why I need to think about semantic segmentation. \n I'm considering doing crack detection (I will take three classes from the latest rdd dataset). \n And what are the two or three suitable ways I can move forward?\n I am considering applying instance segmentation by Yolo or mask rcnn on a subset of the Road damage dataset 2022 dataset(the newest version includes six countries dataset(47000 images). And I am going to test the model on other benchmark crack datasets. \n Almost all the crack dataset has ground truth. And rdd is based on a bounding box. so if I want to use rdd dataset , I have to generate mask for the cracks. \n I want to publish a good research paper based on this. \n But please let me know if you have some ideas based on my perspective. What about a vision transformer? Can I apply that? Computation won't be an issue in my case. I can also extend my work from crack damage detection to road damage detection. \n I have three months to complete the whole task. I'm not good at coding, but a pro at copying using google :) I just started recently. \n If you have some idea about data labeling, please let me know. \n I'm eagerly waiting for the comments.\n    submitted by    /u/Sami10644  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "At the code level, there's general agreement that we should use inline comments, readme, and git to state/track our assumptions for that context. Shit breaks fast when we don't, so we're more on that perhaps. \n But in the decision space where the analytics or modeling outcomes are applied to the business process or whatever, documenting assumptions happens at a project level. This is also at the level of the scientific method where the research question and hypotheses are stated (hopefully).\n So to some degree I'm just talking about documentation and ideal project management with effective and ongoing debriefing conversations, which oftentimes should fall on the project manager. \n But in another sense, I'm wondering if it's valuable for data scientists to be a bit more versed in stating/tracking assumptions and communicating about those throughout the project. Rhetorical techniques are also adjacent to this area, which may really help data scientists better advocate for their findings or process. Is it typical in your position to review projects' timelines and reflect on how assumptions changed throughout the project?\n Certainly it varies by organization. And we all know how job titles and responsibilities aren't consistent. So I'm just surveying the landscape.\n    submitted by    /u/WhosaWhatsa  \n [link]   [comments]",
