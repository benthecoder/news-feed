Use these two cols to calculate grouped median and impute two other numeric columns with these median values. \n So far that's what I've done: - For step 1, used simpleimputer() in columtransformer - Created custom transformer for step 2: that accepts data frame and outputs data frame\n But how do I put these together? - Putting them together in columtransformer mess up step 2 because columtransformer doesn't maintain sequence. - putting simpleimputer in columtransformer then adding in a pipeline mess up step two - custom transformer. \n Any help is highly appreciated!

I just had to copy and paste.\n - It could tell what kind of data you're feeding it judging by the header columns!\n - It will give you the python/r code on how to run specific analysis.\n - It even knew how to use scikit-learn to run regression models 🤯 (I mean, this makes sense since it's an AI tool lol).\n Honestly, this is just crazy to me.\n Before I dropped out of graduate school for statistics, I often consulted non-technical researchers in the social sciences. It was always a pain for them to run datasets by themselves just to get some answers to their questions.\n Although ChatGPT isn't perfect (and does make mistakes), it's crazy where the tool is going.\n I think this is really good news for a lot of people who are interested in doing research, but might feel too intimidated by needing to do stats. Obvi...some bad stuff could come from it.

I have seen countless greedy bastards and lazy slackers among humanity so far, human rule is not that great towards humans.\n    submitted by    /u/just-a-dreamer-  \n [link]   [comments]",
