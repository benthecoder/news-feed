Dopt lets you send in data about your users (identify calls/properties) and lets non-devs define rules based on that data for which users should enter the flows. Non-devs can also update content and other custom properties that can be referenced via the SDK.\nFor example, with Dopt’s SDK you can build:\n- a multi-step, interactive product walkthro…",

          "description": "Hi, all. \n I’m am heading out of graduate school with a Masters in Earth System Science. I recently interviewed for a data science role that will be focused on building the next gen water model. I have experience in ground validation of models, but I never really learned machine learning or AI. I just did straight statistics, and built some software relating to research using python and C++. I built some useful tools for getting big data and learned a lot about how to clean datasets and prepare them for other people to analyze. \n That said, I asked for 65-75. When I was on the interview, I asked what the director thought would get. He said he thought I was worth about 85-105. I was kind of dumbfounded, but I’m worried they may cut back as they start looking at what I actually wrote on the application. \n What would you do in this situation? Should I amend that number in the second interview and just say I’m interested in that range now? Otherwise, I’m a bit worried they may just offer what I wrote on the paper and I’ll undercut myself on what I’m worth. \n Thanks for any input.\n    submitted by    /u/corey4005  \n [link]   [comments]",

I generally love playing with data and numbers and out of curiosity started learning the basics of data analytics and haven’t found it difficult (so far). I want to seriously learn data analytics / data science (I know these are different but I want to keep my options open). \n A few things about me:\n - I come from a pure math background (graduated with Mathematics in college) but it's been a while since I had dwelled in that realm.\n - I don’t enjoy coding, not that I can't do it but I am definitely not going to be a master Python or R coder, I know that. I will probably rate myself 4/10.\n - I enjoy statistics, probability and Algebra and don’t mind spending more time understanding the mathematical concepts needed for DS.\n - I also like data visualization, have done a course on Tableau and have been playing around with it. I'd also like to learn PowerBI and Looker.\n I need some help to understand a few things:\n  \nAm I too old now to venture into the field of DS? Am I already in a losing battle due to my age?\n Although I like working on data visualization projects my end goal is to learn to create various statistical models for predicting various outcomes based on different business / use case scenarios - do I need to be really good in coding to do this?\n How far can my interest in statistics / probability (and the lack of interest in coding) will take me in this field?\n Most importantly, I do not want to restart my career as a Jr. Analyst and climb all the way up at this age. Are there any options where I can leverage my experience in tech sales with the skills I shall acquire in DS?\n Anything else I should know?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Boromir_Has_TheRing  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most say that medians are robust against outliers. I'll also accept that medians tell you how a \"typical\" data point behaves.\n Then why don't we just always use a median instead of a mean?\n -> I've seen people really struggle with this one. Even if they understand the math, it's hard to answer this question if you haven't tried to use a median when you shouldn't.

I clipped the video for just when their license plates are in view here.
