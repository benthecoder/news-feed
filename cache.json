Everyone here should know that.\nSo my phone has been failing to charge for three weeks and I bought a new phone today and can't get it set up because the old one is dead and I can't get a verification code. So I moved the old sim card on the advice of one of my sons and the codes are still going to the old physical phone and Google says it will send me a link in 72 hours.\nGoogle is convinced I'm trying to break into my own accounts because I can't get access to codes on my dead phone. So I may lose my access to my google account, my blogs, etc.\nIf anyone has contacts at google and can tell them, yea, verily, Doreen Michele Traylor is a real person who is real poor and we all know her and please let her keep her phone number and her (my full name) google account and get me out of this fucking nightmare, that would be coolios.\nPlease and thank you.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33963269\nPoints: 51\n# Comments: 3",

          "description": "I'm just wondering if you fine folks have any recommendations for a beginner in DS who's looking to polish their resume with some freelance work on platforms like Upwork.\n Bit of background: I'm an electrical engineer by trade and worked in sensor and robotics development for about four years. I also have quite a bit of knowledge in Python and CV/ML libraries, but have only ever used them internally (never actually delivered a software solution to another team). In that time, I also did an MBA so I'd say my business knowledge is okay.\n I decided I wanted to switch out of \"regular\" engineering and more into ML/ data engineering and am now doing a master's in engineering to specialize in ML/CV. Also did Google's Coursera course on data analytics, so I have some knowledge of SQL, Tableau, etc...\n I guess my main question is, given that I have never actually worked for a software team or in a formal DS position, can anyone slip me any pointers on other things I should know/practice or courses I should take before putting myself out there for freelance work? Obviously, at some point, I need to just jump in, but I'd like to avoid mistakes that are obvious to people in the industry but not so much to newcomers.\n    submitted by    /u/icanelectoo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Does anynbody here come from a ECE/Telecommunications/DSP Background and could tell me more about how they got into Data Science? I'm currently enrolled in a Msc in ECE in France, which gives me a lot of freedom to choose what i want to study after that first batch of mandatory courses. I'm very much into the more mathematical/theoretical stuff like DSP and Communications Signal Processing, which have a lot to do with Statistics, Linear Algebra and Systems and Signals, but hate the eletronics and eletromagnetism courses, like RF/Microwave and Circuit Design. In fact, i belive that i would much rather do something that had more to do with people and how people Interact with technology than how to actually build it and have to use the Smith Chart any other day in my Life. I wanna use tools like Statistics and programming to solve Business Problems, not building Large Scale Integrated Circuits. So i was wondering if someone else here had a similar experience and if you think that a Background in Signal Processing or Electrical Engineering is helpful (and how helpful it is) for someone who is considering getting into Data Science. What would someone with that Background have to do to break into the field?\n    submitted by    /u/Internal-Quantity537  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each has a newsletter they promote via a CTA that appears on every page view, and, on average, A gets about 20 new subscribers per month for the newsletter, while B does 800.\n For each client, my task is to find a \"smarter\" way to display this CTA to readers than merely showing it on every page view, sort of a question of figuring out the \"when\" for each reader so as to improve conversion rate. I have full clickstream data of every reader's page visit along with dwell time, maximum scroll depth, referrer, type of device, etc. as well as every time a reader submits a newsletter signup form. \n What kinds of models would you recommend looking into? Would you consider plain predictive ML or something powered by causal influence (which I've seen is in vogue these days)?

I'm looking to work part time full remote (just grind out 20 hours a week instead of working 40 hour corporate job). I have a couple years experience as a DS under my belt, mostly in DoD, which is not friendly to working remotely outside the US. So I'm thinking of maybe working for a consulting company or big tech consulting (AWS or azure) for a year to get experience, then jump into some type of 1099 contracting role with my own LLC that I would setup.\n What I'm thinking is to approach startup or smaller companies, who can't afford to hire a data scientist full time at $200k, but they still could leverage data expertise on a part time basis. From my job, I've realized the most data immature companies have the greatest marginal return, where they have some data management need that's tied to their bottom line. I would come in, help them setup a cloud environment, data management practices, ETL system, any type of algorithm if it's required, tie it to some relevant output (dashboards, reports, etc.), and then teach someone at the company how to operate it. (I've done this with analysts at my job) then I can return periodically to maintain the product for them. \n My goal would be to work no more than 10-20 hours per week at $100/hr.

          "description": "Profile - Canadian. 29y/o. Masters in Data Science.\n Early 2019 - Data Scientist at the start of my career. Loved every second of it.\n 2020 - Became a Finance consultant for a $90k/year package (only for money) where I only use Excel.\n 2022 - 3 years on, I'm still stuck in this consulting firm with a $100k/year package and no promotion. I seem to have lost my Data Science skills.\n My skillset includes Data Science technologies and bullshit consulting projects where I help settle bank books. I have a gift for bullshitting in interviews and at this point I've fabricated my entire resume with consulting projects turned into data science projects from the last 2 years.\n I've been busting my head for the last 6 months on LinkedIn trying to find jobs where I can get back into the data science industry but I cant find anything where I can leverage the last 3 years of my life. I'm desperate to progress in my career. My peers who started on 60k, 3 years back have reached 100k but I'm still stuck at the same rung in my career ladder. I feel like I've wasted the last 3 years of my professional career.\n But what should be my next step? I cant seem to find any niche/opportunities to develop in. How do I progress towards a better job? Should I stay in consulting or leave and go back to Data Science?\n    submitted by    /u/DafaqChicken  \n [link]   [comments]",

So yeah, you can have an outstanding customer service chatbot that can handle other topics. However, the right question is should you? \n If you want a chatbot that does solve issues, not creates more, you must start with the proper requirements. Well-structured chatbot requirements lay the right foundation for your future chatbot development.

Nothing seemed to work.\n One night, while wandering the castle, she stumbled upon a secret chamber. Inside the chamber, she found a mysterious chest. When she opened it, she discovered a beautiful set of lingerie: a pink bra, bow panties, and a narrow waist cincher.\n The vampire was delighted by the find. She quickly changed into the lingerie and admired her reflection in the mirror. Her cleavage and navel were revealed, and her fangs peeked out from her lips. She felt beautiful and powerful.\n In the background, a faint aqua-colored light glowed. The vampire felt drawn to it and stepped closer. Suddenly, the light intensified, and the vampire found herself surrounded by a bright blue background.\n It was then that the vampire realized the lingerie was enchanted. She had been freed from the curse! The lingerie had been a gift from a secret admirer, and the light was a sign of the vampire’s newfound freedom.\n The vampire celebrated her newfound freedom and vowed to use her powers for good. She often wore the lingerie under her clothes as a reminder of her special night. The lingerie was now her signature look, and she was often seen wearing it with a simple background.\n And so, the vampire lived happily ever after, her fangs and lingerie forever a reminder of her magical night.\n    submitted by    /u/Top_Werewolf_259  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Now that I have graduated from college, I am so clueless what path to even move forward in and not be afraid of being laid off later on. Seeing how good Chatgpt and AI art has become, i don't even know what skill to master myself in because there will be a robot better than me at that same skill. \n There are data scientists and software engineers who gave Chatgpt a prompt/code to find an error and give a detailed analysis/solution to that prompt. So far, it has been scarily good. \n I see artists living on the edge not knowing when their branding or graphic design job will be taken away from them. Chatgpt may take over journalism. \n I am ready to learn and adapt. I just want to know where to start from. The idea of investing my time in learning the \"wrong\" thing that would eventually turn obsolete is making me confused.\n    submitted by    /u/ruchi_rich_  \n [link]   [comments]",
