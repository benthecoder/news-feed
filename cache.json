          "description": "I wrote an RSS reader called RSS Brain recently. The motivate is the current RSS readers either don't sort articles by priority, which makes it hard to read posts from HackerNews and Reddit, or sort it with some \"smart\" algorithm which I don't trust. I also like the Google News feature that can show related story from different source, but the sources are not configurable and the algorithm is not transparent either. So with RSS Brain, I implemented these features:\n* Recommend related articles from the feeds of your choice. It's backed by ElasticSearch and the algorithm is described on RSS Brain's website.\n* Option to sort articles by upvotes and time. The algorithm is similar to the old Reddit and you can find it on the website as well.\n* Save search terms into folders so you can filter the articles.\nI've been using it for a while and found these features very helpful. So I want to share this on HackerNews. The frontend is written in Flutter so it has cross platform clients, even though the web version don't feel very \"web native\" because the level of Flutter web support. I guess only time can improve that.\nI don't have enough hardware to scale it up so it's currently in subscription mode to limit the users. I'm going to open source the code (maybe non-commercial license) once I think it's ready so you can host it by yourself. It's still in early stage and haven't been tested by a lot of people. So any feedback is helpful. Thanks!\nUpdate: Added a scroll down hint in the landing page.

I am a data science major and know for a fact I want to go to grad school for many reasons to prolong having to work 9-5 again, secure my tax bracket for the rest of my life, and I’m former military so I have the benefits so I mine as well milk them out while I can. However, I’m having a hard time trying to understand how grad school works and what would be the best option for me. No one in my family has gone to grad school, and am not sure who to go to with this question.\n Do you have to apply for a masters program first, and then go into a phd? I’ve read that after your undergrad you could go straight into a PhD, and you could obtain your masters during that, I’m really not sure and I’m interested in hearing the paths people in this subreddit took. The end goal ultimately is to be able to work remotely, and be able to have very little interaction because of issues I had suffered from the military, so mostly coding. AI/ML may be a better fit, because college has mentioned Data Science will require a lot of interaction. Though, I’m still early in my school career and am sure I’ll figure it out.\n    submitted by    /u/aerosmith760  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am starting a new project, and would like to use Cookiecutter. However, I am having some difficulties and haven't been able to find answers either in the documentation or Stack Overflow. I think I lack some basic knowledge that is assumed by the creators of Cookiecutter, so I hope you can help me here.\n Thank you all in advance.\n  \nI opened an Anaconda cmd window and ran cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science . I answered all prompted questions. After searching for a while I found where the project folder was created. However, how do I get this on GitHub? The only thing I can figure out is to create a brand new repo on GitHub with the exact same name, open it in GitHub desktop, click \"show in explorer\", and then drag and drop all files from the Cookiecutter folder into the GitHub Desktop folder. However to me this does not sound like the intended way to create a new project and put it on GitHub.\n I want to do all development in an anaconda virtual environment. Does the new project folder have to be placed in my C:\\Users\\username\\Anaconda3\\envs\\ directory?\n Should I activate the anaconda virtual environment in the anaconda command prompt prior to running cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science? Does it matter?\n I've noticed that in my anaconda virtual environment folder there are dozens of random folders and dll files that I did not create. Is this going to be a problem if I want my folder structure to be the one outlined by Cookiecutter?\n  \nThank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Morroblivirim  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also have noticed you have to be careful with data science degrees, as some of them don't provide with the skills you really need for the field (i.e. proficiency in certain programming languages). I know on their website they list Python, R, and SQL, which are the most popular programs I've seen besides SAS being used specifically in healthcare.\n I got my undergrad in psych and bio (I know) and have had such a time finding a job that isn't as a research assistant that sets me up to get my PhD. I've been applying for entry-level positions, but have had no luck. If anyone has gone through the program or knows anyone who has, opinions would be greatly appreciated!\n Also, I noticed that they offer assistantships, which is my ideal situation financially if I can get it. Are these difficult to get at SLU? Anyone know how difficult it is to get merit based scholarships as well? I got a 3.97 in undergrad with a lot of bio/chem courses.

For example, say you have an analyst who does a project looking at causes of attrition and maybe they report what they've found to their boss in a 1x1 meeting, but they move to another team/company at the end of the year. A new analyst comes along who would also like to do some projects on those same big questions for the organization like attrition, etc. but they want to know what work has already been done. How do you guys handle this? Do you make effective README documents inside a repo? Do you follow some format for publishing results and share them in something like SharePoint? Do you use project management systems like Jira + Confluence?\n    submitted by    /u/wondermonkey_  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I want embeddings of size 50-100 like glove. Is it possible? If it is, how?\n I also have a follow-up question: If I am able to generate 50 size pre-trained embeddings, Is there any way I can generate a single embedding vector for sentence, considering only selective words in it?\n for eg. sentence = \"I am having headache and also some signs of mild fever.\" In this case, I want final embedding of size 100 (without any padding) generated from token embeddings (of size 50 each) of Bolded words. One approach I think of is concatenation but that will require padding in case more number of Bolded tokens present.

          "description": "I'm interested in ML/AI, but I'm not sure it makes sense for me to go down the computer science career path at all. I like coding and I'm fascinated with the future ML can bring, but work life balance is very important to me. I see lots of new grads with CS degree unable to get a job. Seems like it is started to get oversaturated. Seems like the only way to stay competitive if I were to major in CS is to spend my days on getting high GPA, and then spend every other second actually learning employable skills. I'm very extroverted but I don't mind an isolated 9-5 because I have time to spend with friends. But now it is so competitive I'm not sure it's realistic to have that much free time. Then I look at the Management Information Systems (MIS) majors, they graduate making 80K, it's way easier than CS degree because mix of business and tech, and you don't need to spend the rest of your free time learning skills to actually get a job. Plus if I wanted to get into CS stuff, I could always learn it no matter what degree I have.\n So, if I go with the MIS major and later decide to get into ML/AI, is it still realistic to get into the field without CS bachelors?\n Also, those that have went with the CS major, how was the work life balance?\n    submitted by    /u/Putin666  \n [link]   [comments]",

AI, on the other hand, creates messes of fingers. While hands are hell to create, people at least have the luxury of conceptualizing it in 3d. If we were given diagrams of an alien hand at various angles and poses, we'd be able to piece together how they'd look and function. AI image generators only work in 2d, however, and thus can't parse their wildly varying appearances.

We need a program that requires conversion from PDF to word and eventually run an analysis on it to identify the parties, filing the case and the judgment, and the percentage of success and connections between certain lawyers and judges. Such a project is an AI project that requires someone with knowledge. I would greatly appreciate any suggestion, information, guidance, or consultation on a program.

          "description": "Hi!\n I was thinking about the introduction, in latest versions of Apple OSs, of text recognition in the “Photos” app, and the fact that this feature was introduced something like six years after facial recognition in photos. I was wondering if this could be explained in relation to economical interests (i guess that text recognition, while much more useful than facial recognition – to me, at least –, is less sensational on a marketing level) or to an actual higher complexity of development (i guess that there is much more variety in typefaces than in human faces; also, i guess that facial recognition is more profitable (i mean, not only in terms of money) and the foundations are much more evolved).\n I'm not involved in the field of AI work, so I apologize in advance if the question is a banal one (:\n    submitted by    /u/nina_tek  \n [link]   [comments]",
