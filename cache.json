It rarely buffers or fails to load. Compare that to the Reddit video player or the Twitter video player or Vimeo. It's much better. Netflix loads poorly initially for me quite a bit (granted it's trying to load much higher quality).\nHow did they manage to get the engineering talent when seemingly FB, MS, Netflix, Amazon, Google are all fighting for that talent?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34421594\nPoints: 29\n# Comments: 15",

Worse, those negative feelings seem to be leaking into my personal life and slowly alienating friends and family.\nTherefore, I've been pondering a change of pace. The classic HN answer is of course \"create/join a startup\", but I've also been looking at areas more adjacent to scientific research.\nOne option that has come up is the US Department of Energy's national laboratory network[0]. From what I understand, the pay is 33-50% of FAANG, but they do seem to have interesting projects (e.g. the nuclear fusion facility that was recently in the news).\nHas anyone here worked at one of them before?

But I am fascinated by the world of data and artificial intelligence. So I was thinking of starting training as a Data Analyst and then scaling up in positions until I reach my ambitions. \n Is this a good idea ? Where should I start ? \n I was thinking of starting by reading books that explain in a general way the world of data to get an overview and then continue by studying Linear Algebra, statistics and probability with the R programming language. Learning excel, SQL and tableau. Do you have any suggestions for me ? \n Is C used in some way in the field of Data ?\n    submitted by    /u/HelloWorldCLang  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's a new role but overall I'm having an extremely hard time adjusting. The workstream is too new. There is minimal guidance from my manager and business stakeholders just make vague requests and ask me to figure it out. The volume of work is also so huge that I cannot complete one thing well\n I'm overwhelmed and sometimes feel like going back to my old employer.

I’ve been applying for roles for the past 9 months now. I’ve gotten 3 interview so far, zero offers. I’ve shown my resume to multiple counselors and professionals. And everyone says that it’s solid, yet it really doesn’t feel that way. I’ve probably applied to over 100 roles at this point. In terms of experience I have three internships under my belt. One was over summer. And two during my semesters at college. My grades were decent B+ average. Granted some of the roles I applied to were maybe a bit of a reach. But a lot of them that I felt like I qualified for I barely got pass the screening. At this point I’m considering a data entry role instead of an analyst role.\n    submitted by    /u/basicdude9669  \n [link]   [comments]",

We designed a process, brainstorm sets of metrics (speed, cost, errors, etc.), I confirm metrics logic, build it in SQL/python/visualization tools, spot issues, query more to anlayze, report results, drive decision making etc. etc. etc. Yes it's not product, but isn't it exactly about driving changes through data?\n Dear DS reddit... how should I improve to get a product/user-facing DA offer?

Even though I have already some basic programming skill and a prior mathematical/statistical background I would most definitely need some additional 5 semesters to finish my bachelors.\n The thing is I am already 27 and will probably be around 29/30 when finished. My concern is that it'll be way too late to find a footing/get hired given my age and \"only\" bachelors.\n As an alternative I found this bootcamp which doesn't really feel like one. \n https://www.turingcollege.com/data-science\n From what I can tell their curriculums are pretty good and they seem elite in that they handpick their student to have a high success rate working for them. Most of their programs are no longer than 12 months. \n I myself am not a \"career\" person. I don't have to be the best in the field, work for a Fortune 500 or whatever. I simply want to get into the industry without being stuck to juggle spreadsheets for the rest of my career.\n Therefore I am on the fence whether I should finish my degree or go alternative way and may already be for a job in less than 18 months. I am afraid that I will be kind of stuck after the course. \n Anyway, thanks for advice.\n    submitted by    /u/thatboyiscray  \n [link]   [comments]",

I watched some videos on Youtube and I got confused. Because each K Means Clustering prodices a variable for which cluster the observation falls into they said something about it being between that variable and I did not understand what else. If I have lets say 2 million onbservations I will have a vector of 2 million observations each being a number 0 to 3 (my num of clusters). I take the variance of that but what do I divide it into or what I divide with it to get the F test score? I am using sklearn.feature_selection.f_classif.

Describe the unique game setting in the beginning. The \"player\" (being the user) is born at the start and dictates through text any actions it chooses. Each input from the user represents one year of life. The Game ends when life ends. The Main cast will be random pop-culture icons. The situation's presented are dictated to the user. The game will randomize every new situation and experience, use roll-playing and text-entry adventure mechanics and be a satirical, stylish, funny, mystic, twisted, surreal, lynchian, lovecraftian, \"earthbound-like\", discworld-esque, mythology-based mystery-horror-adventure. The character will be assessed with each action and be gifted a related persona archetype based upon it's choices and state of the persona upon the point the character ends life. There should be over 50 text input interactions from the user before the game naturally ends with a moral. The game can be ended by the user typing \"end\" and will be given an archetype.
