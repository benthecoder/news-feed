          "description": "We present an interactive design system that allows non-expert users to create animated mechanical characters. Given an articulated character as input, the user iteratively creates an animation by sketching motion curves indicating how different parts of the character should move. For each motion curve, our framework creates an optimized mechanism that reproduces it as closely as possible. The resulting mechanisms are attached to the character and then connected to each other using gear trains, which are created in a semi-automated fashion. The mechanical assemblies generated with our system can be driven with a single input driver, such as a hand-operated crank or an electric motor, and they can be fabricated using rapid prototyping devices. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by designing a wide range of mechanical characters, several of which we manufactured using 3D printing. While our pipeline is designed for characters driven by planar mechanisms, significant parts of it extend directly to non-planar mechanisms, allowing us to create characters with compelling 3D motions.\nDetails\nComments",

          "description": "Hey folks, working on a research project right now doing a binary classification on text data. Essentially, I have a ton of text data that I'm looking over and labeling each datapoint (composed of text + a couple of other less useful features) as \"yes\" or \"no\" if the text looks like it fits a condition (I apologize for the vagueness). The unfortunate part is that I'm only hitting \"yes\" a very low % of the time, which is completely expected, but it's resulted in me only having ~100 positive examples. Ideally, I'd have wayyy more. So this brings me to my question, what methods exist to find positive examples more efficiently while limiting how much bias is going into the process?\n I have a couple of thoughts. I was considering doing an unsupervised clustering, maybe K-means, and see if my positive samples fit snuggly into a cluster, and look at the other examples in that cluster. This might work but seems a little inefficient. \n I've also considered building a classifier based on the positive samples I have right now, which might get me something, but I worry a lot about overfitting, perhaps there is a classification technique you could recommend to me in this case that works well with small amounts of data? I've considered simple models like logistic regression, but bayesian methods have also caught my eye. I'm also considering using some sort of tree-based method and increasing the depth of the tree incrementally until I start to see something that I want.\n Lastly, I've tried to use some domain knowledge to generate a candidate list of samples. Basically, I've looked at the positive examples so far and applied what I know to be (somewhat) true about this particular problem to limit the samples a bit more with keyword matching. None of these have been quite as successful as I'd like, so I'd like to consult your wisdom and see if you have any advice for me :) Thank you for your help.\n    submitted by    /u/Doubles76  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Newer to DS work and am looking for some direction on approaches. \n I'm trying to estimate the impact of an event upon a customer satisfaction metric, for both the general population and specific segments. The event is assumed to have heterogeneous effects due to the nature of the customer base (impacted customers in some regions more than others) and was not part of an experimental study.\n I've tried: Using Arima time series modeling based upon the metric, fitting on the time period prior to the event, predicting after the event, and comparing the predicted values to the actual ones. However, Arima doesn't appear to be appropriate due to limited data. There appears to be monthly seasonality, as well as seasonality related to the day of the week. \n Since the customer satisfaction metric is an aggregation from scores provided by individuals, I've also tried using individual scores pre-event as training and using individual scores given post-event as test, fitting traditional classification models to the training set and making predictions on the test set. To estimate the difference between the expected versus actual customer metric, I've taken the training scores and predicted test scores and calculated the aggregated metric for those records as the expected aggregate value and separately calculated the aggregated metric over the training scores and actual test values for the actual aggregate value. However, this method gives me a larger than actual estimated impact - regardless of whether or not I balance the classes during training, this modeling approach tends to predict one customer rating more frequently than the others.\n I've also done some reading into causality libraries/modeling approaches, like econml DML, but I'm not sure how helpful CATE would be here, since my metric of interest is an aggregation.

For the purpose of this question lets say its the ratio of number of times a person clicks on an ad (abbreviated ac) on a website/ time they are on the website. Here is an example of what I'm thinking about:\n subject 1: 3 hrs on reddit, 2 ac. One hour on facebook, 5 ac\n subject 2: 1 hour on reddit, 0 ac, three hours on twitter, 2 ac\n subject 3: 5 hours on live journal, 1 ac.\n In this example I would create 4 features: ac/hour reddit, ac/hour facebook, ac/hour twitter, and ac/hour livejournal. I'm having trouble with the fact that these four features will have a lot of missing data. In this particular example, pretend that I've collapsed the webiste categories as much as possible. What are some other options of dealing with the data? How does one use data like this in a model without imputing the missing values? I'm open to not using a ratio for this feature set - but I do want exposure to the website to be included somehow.\n Thanks!\n Edited to add, the missingness comes from the situation when someone has 0 hours on the website, its 0 clicks/0 hours so its undefined. This is a different situation than a zero someone who is on the webiste for 5 hours but never clicked on an ad.\n    submitted by    /u/Ohio_Bean  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I work for a small engineering firm. I have been tasked by my CEO to train an AI to solve what is essentially a regression problem (although he doesn't know that, he just wants it to \"make predictions.\" AI/ML is not his expertise). There are only 4 features (all numerical) to this dataset, but unfortunately there are also only 25 samples. Collecting test samples for this application is expensive, and no relevant public data exists. In a few months, we should be able to collect 25-30 more samples. There will not be another chance after that to collect more data before the contract ends. It also doesn't help that I'm not even sure we can trust that the data we do have was collected properly (there are some serious anomalies) but that's besides the point I guess.\n I've tried explaining to my CEO why this is extremely difficult to work with and why it is hard to trust the predictions of the model. He says that we get paid to do the impossible. I cannot seem to convince him or get him to understand how absurdly small 25 samples is for training an AI model. He originally wanted us to use a deep neural net. Right now I'm trying a simple ANN (mostly to placate him) and also a support vector machine. \n Any advice on how to handle this, whether technically or professionally? Are there better models or any standard practices for when working with such limited data? Any way I can explain to my boss when this inevitably fails why it's not my fault?\n    submitted by    /u/CyanDean  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I made an app called MemeSearch that could search a specific meme by text or content.\n App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1668297986\n You can search in two mode:\n  \nText Mode. Search text keywords in that meme. (Which I use OCR to extract from image.)\n Content Mode. Just type \"two man fight\", or \"grandpa holds coffee, laptop\" could work.\n  \nAnd it's completely free: NO ads, NO subscriptions, NO in-app purchase, this app is made for fun.\n ​\n Search by Text\n ​\n Search by content\n See more:\n https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1668297986\n    submitted by    /u/RingoCatKeeper  \n [link]   [comments]",
