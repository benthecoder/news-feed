I want a career that has something to do with forensic/criminal psychology, but can’t narrow it down to a specific occupation. I don’t particularly want to get a doctorate, but I know I need further education to do something I’m remotely interested in. I’m from Illinois and if I continue school I want something affordable and close to home. I’ve recently been looking at being a Crime Analyst/Intelligence Analyst, but my only problem is I discovered this too late and I rarely have data analysis experience (besides the introductory data science class I’m taking this semester). I don’t even know where to start with grad school. Is it possible to apply for grad school for masters in data analysis/science without experience? Should I get certified as a data analyst through an online program instead? I don’t know this is a very unorganized post, but my mind is all over the place about this and I don’t know how to begin narrowing down my options.\n    submitted by    /u/hmmdebatable  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR: struggling to make an anthro shark using AI, and am seeking advice on how to get the result I want, or at least a legible result where you can tell that it is even a humanoid shark\n So, I am trying to create an illustration for a shark race in my brain universe (basically a universe I’ve been building canon for in head since I was twelve) and as I cannot draw well, for the rest of the races I have been able to create illustrations using AI generators like DALL E 2, wonder, starryai, and nightcafe, and this has occasionally been a challenge I usually am able to just put “anthropomorphic ____ wearing a jacket” and it gives me an illustration of an anthropomorphic race, however this hasn’t been working with the shark race, I have been trying everything from adding essays of keywords to grabbing starting images from artists and trying to get the AI to build off of that, and it just keeps looking messy, wrong, or comes out looking like an actual shark instead of a humanoid shark. “Well why not just use art you find other people have made if you aren’t going to profit off of this?” I hear you asking, and to that I say I need something unique to me in there in order for it to feel like mine, even if I’m just asking an AI to branch of and start with someone else’s picture, the end product still feels like mine. Anyways explanation out of the way, for the life of me I can’t figure out how to do it the way I want it, so my last resort is in turning here, does anyone else use AI to make anthropomorphic characters? And if so, what AI do you use? What keywords do you use? And please, do you have any tips to help me get the result I want i feel Ive tried everything haha\n    submitted by    /u/TARDIS_Boy_01  \n [link]   [comments]",
