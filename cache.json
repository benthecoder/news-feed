          "description": "Hi friends.\nBeluga is my reaction to all the Twitter craziness. I’ve been thinking about this idea for a long time and finally decided to build the app a few months back.\nThe idea is straightforward. Can we build a Twitter-like experience without central servers or a single point of failure? RSS was my point of reference, and that’s why Beluga is essentially a feed reader/writer.\nWhen you publish a post, Beluga will create a beluga.json file and upload it to your S3-compatible server. Other users can follow you and get updates by fetching that file. The beluga.json file is JSON Feed compatible to maximize interoperability. The app also publishes a beluga.xml which is a standard RSS feed. Users can follow your Beluga feed from the app or from their favorite RSS reader.\nTo make the app even more accessible, a static mini-site is generated and published to your S3-compatible online storage.\nHere’s the mini-site of my feed: https://beluga.gcollazo.com\nPlease give the app a try.\nUpcoming features:\nEasy publish without setting your own S3 bucket\nRead-only mode\nMultiple device sync\nSupport for more S3 compatible providers\nSupport for GitHub pages\nMastodon interoperability\nComments",

The language is still the same, but the specifics change, as well as the tools and techniques one learns and uses.\n I think it's somewhat similar to learning another language. In both cases you're still learning Spanish, but someone who learns it because his girlfriend is Colombian may do it differently than someone who learns it because he'll live in Colombia for 3 months.\n In the first case, the person may want to learn intimate dialogue sooner, whereas the other person might ignore those and focus more on small talk and conversations they expect to partake in as a tourist.\n So, with that in mind, my question is, do you think learning Python should be done in a similar way for us? I'm not even asking about learning from scratch, mind you, but more someone who wants to go from \"Beginner with a couple months of experience\" to \"Intermediate\" level.\n Is it better to specialize our learning and focus on mastering data science topics (e.g. pandas, numpy, stats)?\n Or is it just as good to go about it the same general way that other people in other areas learn (e.g. reading Automate the Boring Stuff or whatever that other book is called that people tend to recommend to beginners)?\n    submitted by    /u/valkaress  \n [link]   [comments]",

The machine is always running, and it gets very hot.\n Should I be concerned?\n From what I can discern, there are built-in hardware limits to avoid dangerous overheating. But it's also possible for components to fail, and extended model training entails heavy uninterrupted usage which may bust manufacturer expectations. \n For the sake of this discussion, assume that cloud compute is not an option.

I am 26 year old.\n I did an internship with Raymond James this summer in the Mutual Fund and ETF research team. And current doing an internship at a SearchFund company as an unpaid private equity intern. \n I have been talking to my friends who are studying data engineering, which made me realize that I like technology and technical skills, and it also would suit me best since English is my second language. I have been in touch with my finance professor to see if I should do an M.S. in computer science to start my career over. He told me not to because he saw more people regret pursuing a master's and Ph.D. than getting a job and making a slow transition. \n I am currently enrolled in a data science BootCamp and taking five classes. I am fresh to computer science. \n I wonder what possible ways for me to land a data science job or something data related to make a smooth transition since I will graduate in May of 2023.\n What are possible titles that I should search for? \n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/SangThai6879  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems like a great fit for me.\n My issue is that I have no idea where to start when it comes to learning data science and gaining the skills to land employment. I’ve seen 3 paths most people take (formal-masters, informal-courses; and self teaching) \n As a 23 year old with a lot of time on my hands. What are the technical skills a data scientist needs to know in order to be successful? Also what’s a realistic time frame for me to start applying for DS jobs; 3-5 Years?\n Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Worried_Challenge498  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Been following the AI art debate a little. AI has always bothered me a little over the years. I've always had two questions:\n For advocates:\n 1.) How do you believe humans will find meaning as AI continues to be able to do more and more things that humans once did?\n Maybe there is some ideal that people will be free to do whatever they want. But I think deriving value from \"personal projects\" only goes so far. I think humans flourish when we are actually needed as integral parts of a community. Just doing things for ourselves will become an empty pursuit quickly. It's hard for me to see how we don't end up in a world like in Wall-E, except the real life version has a lot more suicides. \n 2.) What is your ultimate goal/hope with this stuff?\n To me it has always seemed like a lot of the technology has been motivated by nothing more than, \"we just wanted to see if we could do it\". Which feels pretty irresponsible. I'm sure I'm off here. But I'm thinking of the IBM computer that beat a chess master. Or the art AI software. What value does that really add except, \"Hey bro wouldn't it be so cool if all I had to do was type what kind of picture I wanted, and it would appear on screen?\"\n That is all.\n    submitted by    /u/BurntTurkeyLeg1399  \n [link]   [comments]",

This gets, even more, tougher in a class of twenty, thirty, or forty students in which every student has to pass through the same tests, irrespective of the student's personalized needs.\n That said, the schoolrooms of today have not changed much in the past 50 years. Students sit in a room together and complete the same lessons—typically using the same textbooks—no matter their learning skills or expertise in a particular subject. Some students get left behind. Others are left unchallenged and bored by this one-size-for-all approach.\n AI could do all this now. AI today is helping teachers in creating a series of smart content programs and intelligent tutoring systems that help students learn in a more customized approach. Students will be able to learn new things in a much better way with advanced tutor apps.\n Such apps can become education mentors for students and provide engaging learning opportunities.AI can now track the performance of an individual student based on his previous grades, participation, and performances and help a student realize his maximum potential.\n The rest of this article covers some ways in which AI is making education smarter, cheaper, and more accessible to all:\n  \nAI as a tutor\n AI can automate grading\n AI can provide cognitive insights in classrooms\n AI can improve the education system\n  \nRead more...\n https://owlcation.com/academia/4-Amazing-Benefits-of-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Schools\n    submitted by    /u/IcyCartoonist1955  \n [link]   [comments]",
