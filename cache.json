I'm pretty frustrated, and even given my near-complete disillusionment about capital-driven-tech these days, I can't believe Google is doing this.\nI just got home from being in Mexico where I used my VPN (because of course US financial apps panic if you access them outside the US).\nI fired up my LG TV running the YouTube app (which I'm not signed into) and every, single, ad is in Spanish.\nMy Edge browser on my desktop computer gives results in Mexico and claims I'm in Quintanna Roo. In many places, I cannot override this, at least without signing in and/or apparently explicitly feeding it more accurate location data to \"fix\" it's perception.\nIs this expected/known? At one point, it even said \"based on your IP address\" despite the fact that my IP clearly looks up to a Washington State IP address.\nI just wish I could make this known to Google's advertisers. Are they aware that when I travel, they're pay to show me ads that I can't understand?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34032484\nPoints: 68\n# Comments: 58",

          "description": "Hi everyone, as the title says I am planning to attend and begin UNC Charlotte's Master's in Data Science and Business Analytics and wanted to get a second opinion from people in industry/students. I graduated with a biology degree in 2021 and since have dived into coding, math, stats since school and want to further my education. I understand that OMSA has a program for 10k but I want a program in person where I can develop connections at the same time. UNCC's program is slightly over 20k and has many connections with industries in the area and host a myriad of seminars, career fairs, and have a great placement rate. Now my question is, would the time investment be worth it to develop connections and deepen my analytical/technical skills at this program vs working my way up as an analyst? My goal is to work as a data scientist or a machine learning engineer and potentially work my way into management later on. The link to this program is as follows: https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=33&poid=8834\n Thanks in advance for all responses and insights!\n    submitted by    /u/NoAssociate4601  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m going through the sktime library and reading each and every classifiers summary about the method that’s being used under the hood to fit the model, and I’m basing my choices based on how long it may take to train. For example, half of them are distance based (nearest neighbors) methods, and I know for my dataset a distance matrix (and most data in general) just takes a stupid amount of time to compute. Or some do Shapelet discovery, which is traversing the entire subsequence space and computing distances between the subsequence and original series and using those subsequences (shapelets) to predict, which also, takes a long time.

A three circle Venn diagram is not enough, I will need something like a \"oval flower model\" with multiple intertwining and mutually intersecting fields.\n The basic tools online and in Excel seem not to be self adjusting based on how much text I want to put into the image (some fields require a lot of it). So I would like to find an online tool which can create a beautiful visual representation for me and which would automatically adjust the size of the diagram fields. \n I am not proficient yet in advanced tools or programming languages like R or Python, so I would like something simple.\n I am sure such a thing exist, I just suck a bit at finding it.

I want to check how meaningful certain features are, whether they correlate etc.. Then I'll drop features and/or engineer derived features and see how they cluster and whether PCA will result in any insight with regard to feature relevance?\n Since I'll likely use the insight of the PCA to inform the feature engineering, I think a holdout data set is necessary - at least in theory. However, since anomalies are both _anomalous_ and sparse, I'm not really sure whether this can actually be practically implemented.\n Any pointers to best practices or or design philosophies would be much appreciate by this unsupervised newbie. ;)\n    submitted by    /u/norfkens2  \n [link]   [comments]",

In case of the inverse sigmoid and tanh (logit and arctan), I receive NaN values, although with the inverse leaky ReLU, on certain datasets, the method yields better accuracy.

Is the military using AI do improve military scenarios and design more effective weapons? Is the Federal Reserve Bank using AI to make financial decisions? Are investment banks using AI to model stock and bond markets, to improve their performance? Are American military experts using AI to help Ukraine succeed on the battlefield?\n If so, how much of this is really secret, and how much known to insiders but just catching the public eye?\n    submitted by    /u/jollybumpkin  \n [link]   [comments]",
