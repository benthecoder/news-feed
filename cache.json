          "description": "Hello guys,\n When I was finishing my BSc, I got some splendid advice from reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/mrgoh2/jobs_in_quantitative_finance_for_math_student/), now I'm about to finish my MSc and I'm back for more :D\n I still like coding and statistics, but I don't really see myself in finance anymore, although i don't rule it out completely (I still find it interesting, but i'm not sure this is the industry i want to contribute to, if you know what i mean). I would honestly rather do something in data science. I worked with neural networks (with python, pytorch) in some projects and I found that really interesting. \n So far I had one interview as \"data science consultant\" and it really didn't go well, so I didn't get invited for the second interview. (It was one of my first interviews ever, so it's ok.) I would like to apply to more data science positions, but i don't really find any. I heard from colleagues at uni and online that there are not many positions open in this field right now.\n Now I have an offer as software engineer. Would it be a good idea to start this way? As i mentioned i have a math background, so i guess it wouldn't hurt to have get some experience in writing nice code. My fear is that I get stuck in software engineering and don't really get to apply anything i learned in my studies of mathematics, which would be a big waste. Or is that a wrong outlook?\n I have 3-4 months until i could start with the job. What would you do? Should i try to get something in data science or is it hopeless at the moment? Would you start as software engineer? or would you recommend something completely different to me? I'm not sure what to do, any piece of advice is greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Mot09  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, the DL ensemble takes more than 14 days to run and costs around USD 11,000, while the statistical ensemble takes 6 minutes to run and costs $0.5c.\n For the 3,003 series of M3, these are the results.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/dmyzh3zh2c3a1.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=01c2f025490a1c96dccf562dc5d729c3d9e71a9d\n In conclusion: in terms of speed, costs, simplicity and interpretability, deep learning is far behind the simple statistical ensemble. In terms of accuracy, they are rather close.\n You can read the full report and reproduce the experiments in this Github repo: https://github.com/Nixtla/statsforecast/tree/main/experiments/m3\n    submitted by    /u/fedegarzar  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone I wanted to share this workshop that is happening next weekend in Toronto @ Hxouse \n You can find the link to the application below. You still have about a week to apply and they are looking for people from all across the creative and tech sector to apply. \n INTELLIGENT MACHINERY\n HXOUSE LABS PRESENTS INTELLIGENT MACHINERY- a program focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Composed of panels and technical and philosophical workshops, the program touches on everything from current innovations in natural language image generation and automated vehicles, to future scenarios dealing with artificial general intelligence and super intelligence.\n INTELLIGENT MACHINERY will welcome talented individuals from diverse backgrounds and experience levels to participate in groundbreaking workshops developed in collaboration with the world's leading companies. Through this novel programming HXOUSE LABS will enable and activate a new generation of innovation in the world's most important technical fields. \n FAKING IT, MAKING IT\n Faking It, Making It is a technical workshop that will explore the latest deep fake technologies with a pioneer in the field, Carl Bogan, a.k.a Myster Giraffe. Carl will delve into his creative process, from ideation and narrative building, preparing assets, sourcing content, and training deep fake models, to processing faked footage and compositing final content.\n Deep fakes have been in the news for around a decade; First known for its nefarious use in pornography and espionage, the technology has developed into an everyday part of our entertainment through film and televison, and online content creation.\n The ambition of the workshop is to equip Tenants with knowledge and experience to develop in this new, exciting, and controversial, creative field. This is a two- day workshop that will take place on December 10th and 11th, from 9am to 6pm.\n https://labs.hxouse.com/\n    submitted by    /u/No_Candidate4104  \n [link]   [comments]",
