          "description": "I have noticed that I am getting more and more addicted to consuming information so I am listening to podcasts while working and I watch Youtube videos in my free time. This is all fun and interesting but I feel this makes me want to do things less and less. Instead of working on my own problems I distract myself by listening to ever more information. I get a lot of benefit from this information but somehow it feels shallow.\nI think part of it is that my work is quite uninteresting and doesn't really keep my mind engaged. But the work is tedious enough that I am too tried in the evening to do something interesting. After a few years everything feels like it's a repeat.\nDoes anybody else feel that way? Have you been able to detach yourself from the constant flow of information and focus on your own stuff?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34710830\nPoints: 296\n# Comments: 131",

          "description": "I am solving a regression case for an interview. They gave a dataset with 12 features and 800 observations. I made a regression model in LightGBM and it performed really well in the validation dataset. \n The problem is that it is the only model I made and I would like to try more things to show to my interviewer. Some thoughts:\n ​\n  \nI thought about making a traditional linear regression to compare LightGBM with but the data they gave does not hold the assumptions of a linear model (i.e. residuals not normally dist.)\n I thought about XGBoost but, as far as I know, its performance is similar to LightGBM but LightGBM is faster and uses less memory\n Neural networks are not even considered given the size of the dataset\n  \nThe instructions of the case say that the company is not so well interested in the prediction itself. They explicit say that the approach used to solve the task is more important than the prediction, especially because the data was randomly generated. In this case should I stress with making more models? \n Given that the instructions talk about the approach, I did an extensively EDA, stated all my findings, why I chose to use LightGBM, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/rods2292  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here's the Github repo: https://github.com/miguelscarv/opinions\n The project has to do with entity sentiment analysis, pretty much predicting sentiment on a document about a certain entity (like a person, company, product, etc...) using active learning. The data was scrapped with the Twitter API, so yeah the data is tweets.\n I scrapped 500 tweets about Elon Musk and saved the 100 most recent tweets as a test set and the remaining 400 tweets acted as my training set. I then used a roberta model finetunned for sentiment analysis on tweets (https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest) and it got 57% accuracy out of the box. Mind you that this is a 3 class classification task.\n The cool thing about my project is that it uses active learning to recommend tweets for someone to label with the goal of getting a better model with the least amount of labeled tweets possible. So using the training set I labeled 40 tweets and got my accuracy on the test set up to 66% - a 9% increase in accuracy because I labeled 40 tweets. Now my question is: is that good?\n The model I used was already finetunned for sentiment analysis and I just further fine tuned it. the training loop looks something like: the active learning policy asks a user to label 8 tweets (this is the batch size) and once they are labeled it updates the model and uses that model to recommend another 8 tweets for a user to label.\n The number doesn't really sound good enough to add to my resumé, but tbh I was surprised I got that improvement because there are a lot of tweets about Elon Musk that are hard to label, even for a human....\n    submitted by    /u/AdministrativeRub484  \n [link]   [comments]",

I only work 4hrs a day and my bosses are pretty happy with my performance. Rest of my day I just learn backend stuff, LC practices, or some cooking videos.\n Lately, I am thinking about going back to school part-time for MS in DS, or something else. My company can pay 4k per year for a master's so why not utilize it? I saw a few job postings at my company for DS jobs which motivates me towards this.\n I am thinking to apply @ UIUC for the MCS DS program, as it's just an hour away and has a good reputation.\n So here are some questions:\n  \nAre there any other self-paced well reputed schools for MS?\n Finally, if you have any other advice which you might think I should know then please let me know.\n Are there internships for the DS role? (When I was in college I hardly saw any DS internships) \n  \nMy focus is to get as many DS internships within the company or outside of the company, and what I've noticed is most companies don't offer internships unless one is enrolled in school and pursuing BS, MS, or Ph.D.\n In the end thanks for your attention.

All the worst symptoms of a badly managed 'innovation' team: swapping priorities just when i get into a groove with a project, an ad-hoc project management framework, management agreeing to deadlines without taking feedback on how reasonable or how much effort projects will take, management dropping messages in my inbox with suggestions on shiny low-code tools that they think would be interesting to try out (they are not), management not hiring more staff even though they agree that my position should be split up into at least 2 roles, management asking me to produce work that doesn't ever get used by anyone, etc. I'm quickly planning my exit strategy but have this immediate fire that i need to put out.\n The biggest issue at hand is that the person playing Product Owner is strangleholding me into working on project for which there is currently no data to work with. Product Owner's \"strategy\" for getting data is that when the beta app is built, we'll use the documents that clients upload into the app. However, these documents are highly confidential, and the project will require sending the documents to a third-party vendor for data labeling and re-training the head of a large language model. Product Owner has not indicated at all that these clients will be notified that their documents will be sent to third-party vendors. I know enough about IP law to know there's something off with this situation, but don't have the verbiage to know what to ask for, how to ensure Product Owner did their due diligence, etc. What is within my role as Data Scientist to ask Product Owner that this potential data source will be lawful to work with?\n    submitted by    /u/phenomenonical  \n [link]   [comments]",

Wanted to share a platform a few others & myself have been working on: an easy way to build apps on top of AI Large Language Models such as GPT-3. This video shows the simplest app you can build -- just take one of your great ChatGPT prompts and quickly turn it into a shareable app with an interface anyone can use. You can also chain LLMs together, feed in data from outside sources, and a whole lot more. We have found a lot of value in this community, and so wanted to give you all early access before we release it on a wider scale: Agent Beta Access. Would love any feedback! Btw, here is the app in the video (it's a fun one!): King James Bible Verse Generator.\n    submitted by    /u/leopuli  \n [link]   [comments]",

Wouldn't that result in a shitton of websites closing down, which then results in AIs having a harder time to get their hand on correct information?\n    submitted by    /u/neco_dota  \n [link]   [comments]",
