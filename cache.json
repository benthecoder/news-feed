How much experience you had at the time of the migration - e.g. on one extreme your entire devops experience may consist of just Heroku (that's me) or on the other extreme you may be a k8s guru (this helps others gauge how they'll go)\n3. How valuable were your learnings? E.g. replacing Heroku with an IAAS instead of another PAAS might take longer but give more fundamental learnings, and hence be worth it for some\n4. Cost comparison\n5. Summary/description of your apps (e.g. 20 tiny apps with a few hits per month, 5 medium with ~20k hits per month, 2 large with 1-2m hits per month type thing).

          "description": "How do you deal with changing features in a regression problem? I imagine this is quite common in a product/marketplace company. Here's an example:\n Let's say the task is predicting car prices for an online marketplace, a value you'd like to present to someone about to list their car on the site. You can use your marketplace's historic sales as a training set. However, as the marketplace evolved, more features were added to the car object, and maybe some stopped being used. E.g., in the early phase of the marketplace, you had 3 features: car model, year, and color. Then maybe later on the company stopped collecting color, and instead now collect MPG and transmission type. So now you have 4 features on the newer dataset: car model, year, MPG, and transmission type. And so on and so on...did you just impute the missing values? not use features that are missing data? Split test/train to only reflect current features? Is it a constant game of cat and mouse keeping up with the fresh features?\n    submitted by    /u/foreignparent  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey r/datascience! I'm dropping by to show off a new platform I'm calling \"Artemis\" that's intended to serve as mission control for data science teams. It will be releasing soon, free to individuals and academic institutions, but I want your feedback as the finishing touches are refined.\n Artemis is one platform that allows you to document, aggregate, search and share your data science scripts with your team. I'll keep this short by leaving a link that lets you interact with a live demo version of the platform right here. \n If you like it, that's great! Click the link to be notified of our impending free release. If you hate it we REALLY want to hear why -- click the link to tell us why! <notification/feedback link>\n If you're keen for a brief read: \n Working in data science roles at Mayo Clinic and Caltech, I was frustrated by the inefficiency of monorepos. With teams of any size, it was a challenge to a) document our scripts in a way others could understand and b) find the script you're looking for. I build Artemis to solve this problem by offering:\n 1- A new way to give your scripts visual documentation that shows, not tells, what each section of code actually does. Add special in line comments Artemis can read then run your script with our command line utility to generate documentation you can use to step through your code. It's a doozy to explain in full via a Reddit post, but you'll see in the demo that it's really not that complex.\n 2- A new dashboard to aggregate, share and search your scripts. You can post the Artemis documentation for your scripts to our dashboard where they display beautifully to your team (please, just look at the demo). Each post contains your interactive documentation, the GitHub link to the script, links to related files, a written description and a title. The goal here is that your team can have an internal app store of sorts that makes it easier for each member of your team to borrow bits of code and entire scripts.\n    submitted by    /u/Artemis_Devtool  \n [link]   [comments]",

For reference I am currently a rising junior attending a large state university Studying Economics with minors in Statistics and Mathematics. I've been fortunate enough to intern in an Analytics/Modeling role at a large fortune 50 insurance company and also have DevOps experience at a lab.\n Recently though I've been applying to summer 2023 internships and was able to get multiple offers at several large companies. I've narrowed down my offers to two different companies which I will briefly describe.\n Company 1: Large Fortune 500 Banking/Credit firm, located on the east coast, with a high 'prestige' name. Pure Data Analytics Internship (Dashboards, Reporting, SQL, Automation, ETL, etc).\n Company 2: Medium Sized Car Automotive group, located near my current university, offering a pure Data Science Internship (Focus in pricing, loans and credit modeling)\n Ideally I would love to work in Fintech moving forward which is one of the main reasons Company 1 stands out. However moving to Company 1 would be a pain regarding location as I would have to travel across the nation.\n Additionally the experience I could gain at Company 2 seems great, there business model relies heavily on the data science team to develop production level models. Further I've met the team I would be working with and could tell I could learn a ton from them.\n I am aware that the prestige I could gain from Company 1 would be immense, however I am weary to chose the role just because I'm worried it will only lead to more data analyst internships down the line (which I would ideally like to avoid).\n Further, I'm very passionate about ML/econometrics/statistics and although I understand and appreciate the power of pure analytics, I'm worried I could see myself getting bored in a strictly analytics based role.\n I would really appreciate any input or thoughts!\n    submitted by    /u/fleekpanda416  \n [link]   [comments]",

My soon to be father-in-law (STBFIL) is a brilliant interventional cardiologist and he believes this is a Ghost Cat. \n I slightly believe this but my education calls me to reason that this image is using multiple pictures and the phone is programmed to use a summation function over the pixels between images to sum the vectors and make it appear that the cat is transparent. I promise that the cat is not behind the glass! I know this from seeing the cat before taking the picture and remembering the event well. What do you think?

No thanks, not interested. In many ways your intelligence is already anti (negated) by those with power over you. AI represents a terminal point of the technocracy. AI is the antithesis of sovereign individual intelligence.\n Technology platforms are committing entire categories to AI, medium included. AI is all around us, as if being forced onto us. It honestly feels coercive. We are in the middle of a bubble right now, well, maybe more like a quantum foam. We’ve been automating processes since the industrial revolution, automation is nothing new. You have nothing to worry about, well maybe your job if you work in tech (I’m sure you’ve seen the news).\n Do you honestly think all of this has arisen out of the pure intellectual curiosity of the masses? No, this obsession is being forced upon us by those seeking to ride this wave of investment dollars as long as they can. People are being paid to write about AI. The goal is to captivate the mind while convincing you there is simply no point in resisting. They seem to suggest you should take your own intellect and multiply it by negative one. The message appears something like: “Trust it because you’re not even intelligent enough to trust in your own intelligence.”\n Tech is stagnating and the Metaverse is gasping for breath. We are in the beginning stages of a re-quantization of human prioritization. Surely you’ve heard of The Great Reset. Well, what’s the point in resetting a system only to get the same outcome? I think we need A Great Re-quantization. A movement of individual thought.\n    submitted by    /u/PracticalChicken1  \n [link]   [comments]",
