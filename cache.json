          "description": "Hi HN, wanted to share a project that I’ve been working on recently.\nPodText allows users to find anything said on a podcast. You can also listen and share clips to a specific part of the podcast audio, simply by highlighting the text of that part. Currently there are just over 25k podcast episodes and I’m adding a lot more in the coming weeks (yes my GPU bill is painful).\nIn order to monetize it, I’m building a sponsorship database to help sponsors find podcasts and vice versa. This will be sold in the form of a $99/month “PodText Business” subscription. I bet I could charge a lot more to large sponsors but I’ll tweak that as I talk to potential customers.\nRight now the UI is very bare bones (doesn’t even have pagination) but I’ll polish it once the data pipeline is working well. Please let me know if you run into any bugs or have any questions about the site or business model.\nPS: I'm a regular on HN using my real name but can't post under that account since my employer will fire me if they found out about this project :-)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34727695\nPoints: 105\n# Comments: 39",

          "description": "Hi r/datascience,\n Apologies if this question is out of place (or gets asked super frequently). But I would really love some insight here. \n I (31 Male) am currently a carpenter - and while I do love it - I’m not positive that I want to spend the rest of my working life in it, for a multitude of reasons. Prior to becoming a carpenter, I graduated with a B.A. and worked in Marketing for about 2 years and then became a project manager at a bank. It was there that I was exposed to working with the data management dept on a few projects. While I am basically a total novice, it really interested me. I liked the “hands on” nature of it, and I liked the logical and structured approach to problems and solutions. I would also really love to work remote and be able to be more flexible/travel more.\n I’m now starting to consider a career change in the near-ish future, and wondering what my best route might be. I’m married but no kids, and could afford some education (~$20k or under ideally) to make the change if that’s required. Otherwise, I wouldn’t mind diving in myself to start learning and find employment on the ground level if that’s possible.\n Thanks for any insight into what I should consider about a career transition, as well as about the field as a whole.\n    submitted by    /u/robin_nohood  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some backstory: During the pandemic (apologies if I brought unpleasant memories) I started my self taught journey in data science, which involved watching a lot of tutorials, reading articles which somewhat gave me the jist of what algorithms and fundamentals (statistics, python,sql) are in the line of work. I watched some courses on statistics to try actually understand some concept like probability and especially harmonic mean lol, learnt SQL but never got to know how I'd use SQL to actually get data from a database anf use it for modeling. 2 years later, I honestly don't even know what am doing anymore, I wake up, log in to kaggle, find an interesting dataset, formulate a problem that might need solving (no matter how ridiculous it is) and do some analysis or build a model, and by the end of the day I contemplate whether what am doing is enough to actually land a job in the coming years. Don't get me wrong but I actually am very interested in the field.\n With a all the blogs and multiple YouTubers around providing information on what data science is all about I end up questioning the very name of the field, what the actual **** is data science? Feels like I have been doing nothing in the past few years (jus 2 lol) I have made some models with which I am proud of especially a food recommendation system that I ended up presenting as my finals project..in addition, I read a lot of threads in the sub of what employers are looking for during interviews and realize that there's so so much I still don't fully understand....\n Apologies for the rant, but today is jus one of those days that I question my efforts in the field..

          "description": "I got a promotion from Senior DS (150 base, 175 TC) to Lead DS (160 base, 185 TC).\n I have about 3.5 years experience leading teams, 6.5 years total. I joined this company a little over a year ago as an IC for the pay bump and was asked to lead the team after a couple of months.\n The model I inherited made < $1mm annually, and now it's on track for $2.5 - $3 mm since I took over. All stakeholders are happy, and I'm well liked within DS according to my boss and his boss. 10k feels like a very small difference, not a large enough difference for the promo or the scope of responsibility.

Whether you have created a model that is specific to a particular domain or industry, or you have developed a model that is particularly advanced and highly specialized, we would love to hear from you.\n So, if you have a great fine-tuned GPT model, or you know someone who does, send me a message.
