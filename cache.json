If I reduce my sample size to 30-50 ish, my mean of sample means is closer to my population mean and the distribution is more “normal” in a sense. \n My population is in the 1,000,000 range for counts of observations.\n    submitted by    /u/renok_archnmy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Currently debating the way we're going to implement an algorithm change for an opinion ranking tool. Would really appreciate any opinions on the scenarios below!\n ---\n Imagine 100 people participated in a simple ranking exercise where they were asked to rank 10 options from 1st (most important) to 10th (least important). Participants were allowed to submit incompletes as long as they included 2 or more of the 10 options. Would you expect the scoring algorithm to:\n  \nCalculate the score for each option based only on the total number of participants who *included* that option in their personal ranking.\n Assume that any non-inclusions were the equivalent of a last-place rank, giving 0 points in those cases and therefore using the total 100 participants when calculating the overall score for each option.\n  \nWe currently use Glicko-2 to score ranking options. Due to Glicko-2's comparative format, we often see researchers include new ranking options mid-project, adding additional participants until the ratings deviation reaches a similar level to the original ranking options. While we can replicate this format with a Borda Count using method 1 above, I would imagine the majority of researchers would expect the survey to use method 2.\n An optional third method would be to combine the two approaches -- to rank newly-added options based on all participants that saw it, ie. only using a total count of 60 participants if the new option was added after the 40th participant completed their ranking.\n Interested to hear what you think? We've found that Glicko-2 is a black box for researchers and therefore they can't ensure their findings will be adopted and trusted when people disagree with the results.\n    submitted by    /u/danielkyne  \n [link]   [comments]",

The company is currently transitioning into an enterprise mindset and is trying to uniform the SFDB for each of these companies. Holistically, it's not ready for deep analytics and we spend a lot of time building/hacking together BI reports and working to automate a slew of marketing data connections into a central DB. Busy + working on foundations on the fly is the key take away here. Not a ton of analytics actually going on.\n One of these companies has the data volume, internal resources, and data framework that would be needed to double down into actual analytic investigation. After showing them how it is impossible to find actionable insights on marketing strategy with our current ecosystem, they caught the vision that we need to design proper modeling/testing vs eyeballing - and that the upside is enormous.\n There is appetite to start designing marketing tests to optimize for revenue and diminishing return. However, we need someone who can embed with this group and navigate what type of data environment they need to answer the questions we want to ask, educate leadership and developers in building the data environment, and then lead them in building test arms. Finally, assessing results + iterating.\n I recently got the buy-in to add headcount to our team. I'm not sure what resource to add though. We have 2 data analysts who are eager to lean and apply more data science. I don't know if we should come in with a net new data science 'heavy hitter' to establish enterprise standards, a data engineer, or let my team learn to navigate this on top of their other responsibilities. \n Help me Obi-wan\n    submitted by    /u/mistermmk  \n [link]   [comments]",

Do you also do pandas programming?” Or “I see you have data science experience, how about data analytics?” \n How does one work in data and Python, and not know how to use pandas or to do analytics?

All these articles teach you how to check for these assumptions, but they don't tell you what assumptions must be held for the model to be implemented effectively. \n Some of them I can deduct myself: if there is no linear relationship between X and y you shouldn't force a linear regression on it, for example. If the outcome is not binary you shouldn't force logistic regression on it. And so on. But others I don't know how to evaluate, and with what level of stringency they need to be met before you throw out the model altogether and try something else.\n What if the points in the QQ plot are not perfectly linear and some values escape the line at the beginning and end of the graph while being still mostly linear? What there is some heteroscedasticity in the residuals? Do you get rid of all influential outliers? Can you leave some in? How do you justify these decisions?\n I feel like there are plenty of tutorials out there on how to check on assumptions for plenty of models, but I am struggling to find ones that take the time to explain in detail to what degree certain assumptions can be left unmet before you have to throw out the model altogether and think of another approach.

          "description": "Hello we are seeking a volunteer(s) specializing in machine learning AI development t assist on a couple of collaborative group projects centered around developing advanced market trading AI. One is a hybrid series of parallel and perpendicular AI chains that filter out the best predictions for the \"big moves\" for the next 24 hour period, the other is a bot generator that sends bots out to search the web for key data points and trades automatically based on that. We are seeking those with any background in software development. It is worth mentioning that while this project only offers exclusive access to the finished product, those who make it to the end may also be offered a paid position in the startup company that the founder of this group owns (the company is not in any way involved with this project). Thanks for your time, feel free to comment directly on here if you're interested or DM me directly.\n    submitted by    /u/38931841Hz  \n [link]   [comments]",
