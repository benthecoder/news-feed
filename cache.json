I see posts from people suggesting to others to stand their ground and tell management and their leadership that their way is the best way, that they are the data scientist and know best. I see similar posts telling people to be unwavering and uncompromising in their communication. I see posts where it is clear people have no tight deadlines and a seemingly unlimited budget. I see posts where people can seemingly focus all their time and energy working on models and ignoring all SQL, data cleaning or data wrangling work. I see posts where people seem to have access to perfectly clean data at all times.\n Is this sub filled with students and junior folk who have yet to experience the real world? Or have I only experienced companies where sometimes \"good enough is ok\", where we have to bend to budget and time constraints, where we have to sacrifice complex analysis for a simple one which is understandable by stakeholders, where data is a pile of trash, where you spend the bulk of your time doing donkey work.\n Curious to hear everyone's thoughts here.\n    submitted by    /u/ciarandeceol1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know that we have a RMSE of 1 m/s between this estimation and the true wind speed.\n One issue I have with these data is their size: I want to try to be create as small file as possible to simplify I/O operations. Let's imagine several situations:\n  \nencode them on 8-bits data between 0 and 25.6 m/s, this means that we can't distinguish speed difference lower than 0.1 m/s.\n \nencode them on 8-bits data between 0 and 51.2 m/s, with a minimal speed difference of 0.2 m/s.\n \nencode them on 9-bits between 0 and 51.2 m/s, with a minimal speed difference of 0.1 m/s.\n \n Solution (1) and (2) can be stored in 8-bits PNG files. (3) can be stored in 16-bits PNG files, but I'm confident the compression scheme would reduced the filesize quite well -though it is quite a dirty & roundabout way-. This also keep the advantage than PNG files can be previewed in the file browser.\n So, here is the question: If I know the RMSE between my estimation and the truth value of the wind speed is 1 m/s, is it necessary to keep a quantization of 0.1 m/s?\n    submitted by    /u/TrueRignak  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since pre-booking is a future variable, I used it as future covariate model (exog).\n Another issue, was that pre-booking is usually not present that far into the future (2 week) and to generate 2 week forecast , the pre-booking should be known.\n To tackle, this problem I used a cascade model.\n Model 1 - Using pre-booking historical data , I first generated pre-booking forecast 2 weeks into the future.\n Model 2 - The generated pre-booking forecast by model 1 was used as covariate to generate true demand prediction.\n Also, in both model I'm using features - day of the week, weekend or not.\n The final demand prediction varies and I feel it's too messy.

It can even search through images, audio, and video. Sometimes it's even better to use a combination of Neural Search and other methods to get the best results.\n Sounds a lot like something Google Search would do? But from what I understand, Google uses \"artificial neural networks\" to try and understand what we are looking for and find the best websites for it. But I think Google also uses lots of other ways to help us find what we are looking for, so it's not just using the neural networks.\n Anyone know the difference?\n    submitted by    /u/gabuzgab  \n [link]   [comments]",
