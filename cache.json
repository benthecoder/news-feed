          "description": "I’ve been out of programming practice and not feeling very motivated for building something real, so I’m looking for programming games that are fun. I’ve tried a few, I think I’d like something that has a REPL or notebook interface as well as or instead of a file-based interface.\nHere are some I’ve tried:\nUsing a general-purpose programming language:\nbitburner - this is quite fun, though there’s quite a lot going on\nhackmud - this seems fun and interesting, though the community is small now. This was my introduction to JS dependency hell.\nSpecial purpose languages:\nThe many Zach-likes - I’ve enjoyed these a lot, but I want something a bit more open than puzzle-y\nElse.heart.break - This was quite fun, but a very slow start and then I broke the quest triggers by skipping right to the end of the game once I got the hacking device.\ncolobot a cool classic educational programming game where you’re an astronaut controlling lots of robots - I remember the missions feeling a lot easier to solve without much programming, but apparently there’s a new mission pack…\nAnyway! Interested to hear your recommendations!",

By looking at summary statistics, I see that a good chunk of these features (100ish) have zeroes for 75%+ of their entries. Seems to me like all these zeroes won't contain any useful info for an eventual model, and it would simplify my process a lot to reduce the dimensionality. Would it be wise to simply remove features like this and continue on my way or would I be missing out on lots of possible info? Maybe take all of these sparse columns and use PCA to hopefully reduce them to one or two principal components?\n    submitted by    /u/Objective-Simple-836  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been thinking if maybe it could be done with some sort of reinforcement learning procedure, where you'd input the adjacency matrix of the graph and it orders the rows/columns in such a way that maximices the upper triangular sum.\n Is this a viable strategy or is this one of those places where ML does not apply?

My PhD currently limits me to academia.\n Gain some opportunities for freelance consulting.\n Improve my capacity to build interesting datasets that could help my research and my students.\n Develop a more visible skillset that I can publicly showcase (this is understandably vague). Long-term ambitions are to build more of an online presence oriented around an in-demand skillset.\n  \nIdeas:\n Some areas that I am brainstorming:\n  \nMachine Learning (Not sure what this industry looks like, so may be a naiive idea)\n Data engineering (could help me build unique datasets, but would not have access to servers)\n Web development\n Data visualization\n Data science (I understand that some of the topics above fall under this category)\n  \nAll of these topics have equal intuitive appeal to me.
