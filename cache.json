          "description": "The HP Smart App forces you to agree to use only their ink before you can use their app.   That shouldn't be a big deal since modern HP printers work fine out of the box without a driver.\nHowever, after you've printed a bunch of pages, they stop working and display the error message \"Printer setup incomplete. Your HP+ printer must be set up using the HP Smart app. Visit 123.hp.com to download the app and complete the guided setup. Any pages you have printed were intended for setup and have been exhausted.\"\nConveniently, this usually doesn't happen until it's too late to return the printer.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33936862\nPoints: 305\n# Comments: 156",

          "description": "So I'm taking a class where the professor is talking about removing data points based on IQR and based on variance... Does it ever make sense to remove data points based solely on this?\n Another question I have is about removing duplicates. She says we should ALWAYS remove duplicates. Is this correct?\n I'm asking because this does not make any sense to me.\n I thought you should only remove data points if they don't represent the real world data distribution (duplicate data entry, wrong measurement, etc...) but in case of doubt (like in our assignments because we don't have enough domain knowledge/knowledge of how the measurements were made) you we should never remove these data points\n EDIT: I want to get a good grade so I'm going to do what she says in the assignments and tests but I want to know what real data scientists do and what I should store as knowledge\n    submitted by    /u/AdministrativeRub484  \n [link]   [comments]",

Googling recipes is a torture.)\n Cool stuff people have used ChatGPT for. \n European Union spent €400,000 on a metaverse party 5 people attended.\n World Cup fans using Snapchat filters to stick to display the pride flag at football games.\n And ofc, Snoop Dobby Dobb (Snoop Dogg X Dobby from Harry Potter)\n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxxqkkbne25a1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11eec4b4c22be771b626ac8474abb7eb5650450d\n If you’re interested in checking it out, there’s a link in the comments. \n And if you hate me for posting this.

          "description": "If anyone can offer any guidance on problems I'm having with my chatbot, I would be very grateful. \n The default model is here: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/chatbot_tutorial.html\n It is a sequence to sequence RNN encoder-decoder with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). It uses a greedy search method and a Luong attention layer. \n My task is to alter it, the project is very open ended. I've decided to try and change it into a \"therapist/doctor-Bot\". At the moment everything is the same but I'm inputting vastly different datasets to the movie_dialog conversations that were default. \n Problems:\n  \nloss: messing with normal parameters (learning rate, number of layers doesn't seem to be helping all that much, can't seem to get the loss < 3. The best I've got so far is 2.4, but that took approx. 3 hours of training with multiple disruptions from Colabs GPU. \n \nSentence length: I have a pretty big dataset formed from 4 separate datasets of patient doctor conversations. Most of the sentences are > 20 words long. At the moment I've limited it to process sentences of 100 words. I can't go too low, the patient doctor conversations are simply very long and if I reduce the sentence length too much I don't have many patient-doctor sentences left to train the model! This is a substantial problem to overcome I feel. The default sentence length was 10, and training was much quicker as a result. \n \nTalking to the bot: The main issue appears to be that the bot's response sentence tends to repeat tends to repeat tends to repeat tends to repeat tends to repeat tends to repeat... etc. Just like that, in a single response. Any tips on how to prevent this? It also will repeat the same response to different questions, especially if those questions are short in length. I can't figure out where in code I should attempt to \"punish\" the bot for doing this. \n \n Thanks for reading.\n    submitted by    /u/BillMurray2022  \n [link]   [comments]",

And after about ½ hour we together had written this true story. Chad took my facts and reformulated them also describing the scenery. It even added some details that was true but i did not tell it.\n I had to hold Chads hand or he wondered of on tangents. But easy to 'nudge' him back on track.\n Then i used the Colab Notebook from tortoise-tts to train a TEXT2SPEECH model with the voice of a famous narrator where i sampled 3 times 10 sec. speech and used for training. No intention to get the voice to sound like the original narrator but just as an ok human like voice.\n Added some ambience sounds and this is the result:\n https://dkcraft.dk/sei/story.mp3 (Length: 5min)\n I welcome Chad (my name for ChatGPT) as a new tool in my digital toolbox.\n    submitted by    /u/sEi_  \n [link]   [comments]",
