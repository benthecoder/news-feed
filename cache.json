Is there anything like this for statistics/data science careers? I also know that coding languages like python, SQL, and R are very common in the data science world, however I never took any of these courses in college. Would I be okay just teaching myself these programming languages, not re-learning all of the other basics outside of coding, and using my degree to get a job?

My position will essentially be starting from a totally blank slate: other city employees are familiar with Microsoft Power BI and Excel, and that's it. \n My question is this: what languages and/or software tools should I set up as the \"standard\" going forward? I have mediocre Python skills, and I'm very good with R, but I'm worried that R is maybe too niche to build a whole DS program around? Maybe it's asking too much to expect future city employees to be familiar with R?\n On the other hand, I'm not sure I will ever have other DS-inclined coworkers... So maybe this is a moot point? If I want to cater my code to my real coworkers, is either R or Python better at interacting with Microsoft Excel (meeting them where they are)? Sorry if this is a weird set of questions, I just want to try and think things through before I go too far down any path, hopefully to \"future proof\" my work.\n    submitted by    /u/dankatheist420  \n [link]   [comments]",

More specifically, you'll learn about:\n 🎯 Query composition patterns - How to make your complex queries shorter, more legible, and more performant\n 🎯 Query maintainability patterns - Constructing CTEs that can be reused. In software engineering, it's called the DRY principle (don't repeat yourself)\n 🎯 Query robustness patterns - Constructing queries that don't break when the underlying data changes in unpredictable ways\n 🎯 Query performance patterns - Make your queries faster (and cheaper) regardless of specific database you’re using.\n Toward the end of the workshop, Ergest answers over a dozen questions from SQL professionals all over the world. \n Watch the full workshop 👉 here 👈. It's free, and don't worry, you're not being sold on a SaaS product 🤣 \n If you enjoyed this video, please join Ergest and +1,000 like minded data professionals in our Slack Community, the OA Club!

I love the idea of working from home and I'm also excited to start learning to code, but the affordable university I have chosen doesn't have a computer science course, which would be more suited for me imo as it would be more programming oriented, however, I suppose I can program on my own in my free time.\n What they do have is the computational mathematics course, I've never heard of this before but it is heavily math based with a few programming classes sprinkled here and there. As I don't know much about these classes yet, I'd like to ask your advice if taking all of the ones listed is what will definitely help me gain the framework to have the brain of a data scientist. So here they are:\n So they have calculus and analytic geometry, intro to statistic analysis and intro to discrete mathematics, matrix and linear algebra (I've heard that this one is very useful for the career), abstract algebraic structures, multivariable calculus, applied differential equations, probability I, and mathematical molding and simulation.\n The reason why I listed all of them is because I want to hear your advice to know for sure if taking all of these is worth it or if some of it might be a waste. If any of you are familiar with these courses please let me know. I don't know much yet what path I should take, so any advice would be appreciated.\n Also, if you can tell me what websites or links you used to study certain programming courses, or the names of books that teach them, I would like to hear it as well.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/SleepingPooper  \n [link]   [comments]",

Language: Mostly Python. Read below for full details.\n ​\n I'm looking to learn how to build an ETL where I can:\n - Pull data either in frequent batches or continuously (streaming) from more than 1000 sources, all of which will have their own acquisition algorithm (mining, communicating with APIs, Local-fed .csv files etc.) and cleaning\n - Deposit into a data storage in the cloud (no server rooms) following manipulation as relational (or whatever you think would be fastest) database system\n - Utilize something like Airflow where I can run / test the run performance and handle errors as the data mining algorithms run in parallel\n - Use an app full of the desired dashboards built using the data we stored previously so the analyses can be displayed using desired KPIs\n - Do all this in a cybersecurity-conscious manner\n ​\n Any technology, classes, courses, bootcamps, required languages, cybersecurity resources, parallel running resources appreciated. \n I worked as a data scientist all my career so I'm familiar with scraping, Python, data wrangling and relational databases, however, I never had to build a whole infrastructure and I'm up for the challenge. \n Any tips & tricks appreciated! :)\n    submitted by    /u/Text-Agitated  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've implemented a small and simple model that serves a simple purpose, which took me roughly a month to complete. It took another 3 months to wrap it as a microservice not only for the product, but for other products to use if they would like to. It took a while to run the backend, understand their microservice framework, and this is my first time creating one.\n I understand being a good backend engineer can't hurt, and if I wanted to, it provides skills if I ever want to pivot to SWE. But I feel like there's a LOT more to learn within the data science field already but now I have to add SWE to that list as well? \n On the one hand, I understand that DS isn't just building models, cleaning data. It's using data to help the business, regardless of the tools you use. So if microservices and proper deployment gain visibility and actually 'productionize' your model, then it's just something you do.\n On the other hand, my mentor told me that that's why we have many software engineers whose strength is creating microservices and making models available via API. \n ​\n Would love to hear any thoughts, and if this is normal among experienced data scientists, please comment.

          "description": "I'm trying to generate a gibberish language to use for character dialogue in a game, similar to the 'Animalese' of Animal Crossing. \n At the moment, I am hashing the English input sentences, truncating the hash to match the input sentence length, and then mapping each hex character of the hash to an arbitrary syllable (which is associated with an audio clip). While this works well enough, I am hoping to add some realism using universal sentence embeddings, so that similar sentence meanings map to similar gibberish forms and it hopefully seems more like a real language. I need the following features:\n  \nSentences with similar meanings should have a similar gibberish output. For example, if the sentence 'hi there' maps to 'grebgol', the sentence 'hello!' should be likely to translate to 'grebgol' as well, or a string similar to it. \n \nA gibberish sentence should have approximately the same number of syllables as the input English sentence. e.g. \"Look!\" might generate \"Shleg!\" but \"This path is dangerous\" might generate \"Vnepsweg zeb sirugkijun\". \n \n So far, my code is generating a sentence embedding for each input sentence using Tensorflow Universal Sentence Encoder. But I am not sure how to go about generating a gibberish string from the embedding. I suppose I need some kind of dimensionality reduction like PCA analysis to obtain a set of one dimensional vectors from my list of input sentences. Then I can map the contents of each vector arbitrarily to my syllable recordings. But then my gibberish sentences will all be the same length - this is where I'm stuck.\n    submitted by    /u/zl1asdfg  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, if I issued the command of \"Where's my cat?\" it would scan a camera feed and when it located what it thought was a cat, it woud play a sound to guide me there.\n ​\n Does this exist? I can't find anything online, but it would quite literally be life changing for me.
