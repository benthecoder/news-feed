Adjusting price is the single most effective lever a business can use to achieve product/market fit, and there's a strong correlation price nimbleness and market success.\nIn spite of overwhelming evidence of this, most startups pick the price for their product once and then never change it, opting instead to invest in less effective levers like CAC, sales efficiency, \"virality\", churn, etc. Why?…",

This is all stored locally and end-to-end encrypted for syncing to to all your other computers. All of this is easily queryable via Control-R and via the hishtory CLI.

I recently completed their 3rd course. I was quite overwhelmed frankly as I had never worked with NLP. I really wanted to stop for a while and develop something of my own as a project to test my knowledge. I stumbled upon this idea of building a disease prediction model last week and I really wanted to get some ideas on my model. I scraped diseases, and their symptoms from internet. Symptoms being separated by commas with no sequential meaning.\n  \nSome of my symptoms and disease names are multi word, is there any work around for that?\n \nI guess using LSTM is quite useless as symptoms are randomly separated by commas so no sequential meaning. Comments?\n \nI multiplied my dataset by using symptoms in various combinations for every disease. Is this fine?\n \nMy approach so far has been to tokenize each symptom. I did not tokenize labels and rather created a dictionary with indexes. This is because some diseases *labels* were multi word so I cannot pass a token array as label.\n \nShould I go for one hot encoding rather?\n \n I pass the input through an embedding layer **64 dimension**, Global avg pooling 1D, Dense layer 100 relu activations, and 261 outputs softmax activation.\n I got 90% train and val accuracy. Is this approach right?\n Another thing I wanted to do was to be able to predict symptoms from utterances, any suggestions?\n If anyone is interested, feel free to join in the project\n    submitted by    /u/Kind-Thing-7202  \n [link]   [comments]",

I majored in accounting and finance at the university and intended to start my career at the accounting firms. But now I hope to have my own business in AI field. It is because I do have enough knowledge in AI so I cannot build the structure of the business. So I came here to ask to experts(you) about the ideas for a business. \n It's not like I am gonna do that now but I want to listen to you and learn from you. \n What would be upcoming trends in AI business and what are your recommendations if you start a business? \n ​\n Thanks a lot and I appreciate all your opinions :) ><\n    submitted by    /u/cryptolover0  \n [link]   [comments]",
