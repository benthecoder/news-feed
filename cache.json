          "description": "I’m curious what people make of this situation; in particular the general issue of tech companies being unwilling to place stronger than “do whatever you want” restrictions on open-source code.\nin this instance i understand that the company wants to switch a license because they only have an approved set. but what about changing that set? what are some good open-source licenses that allow us to place (small, let’s face it) restrictions on our users?\ndoes anyone have any opinions on how we can push companies that do contribute to OS to use more progressive licenses? (i.e. recognition that neutrality is in fact not “neutral”, etc, etc.)\nComments",

          "description": "Hi all! I'm one of the developers that were working on this project for some time. In recent months, users started to ask us more frequently about the ability to run algorithms on a part of graph stored in database - subgraph. Now to do this, we extended the implementation of C API we had and brought to you the graph project feature that enables running algorithms on a specific subset of a graph stored in the database.\nYou can now do graph analysis with PageRank, degree centrality, betweenness centrality, or any other algorithm on subgraphs without any additional adjustments. Before you had to create new query procedure. You can fire up a graph machine learning algorithm, such as Temporal graph networks and split the dataset inside the query to do training and validation without splitting the dataset programmatically. And last but not least, you can use your graphics card to run one of cuGraph's algorithms on subgraph in terms of seconds.\nYou can find the whole explanation in blog post [1] and you can checkout the code at Memgraph GitHub [2]. Furthermore you can check cuGraph's algorithms we have integrated [3]\nI'd like to hear your feedback on our approach. Also if you have any general feedback, just write it in the comments :)\n[1] https://memgraph.com/blog/how-we-designed-and-implemented-gr...\n[2] https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/\n[3] https://memgraph.com/docs/mage/query-modules/cuda/cugraph\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33065158\nPoints: 22\n# Comments: 2",

I’ve decided to collect some of my thoughts in a very short essay.\n First, I want to discuss the term “AI” itself. In some sense it feels like a marketing term. It’s a very loaded term, and any time it is used, there is almost always a more precise designation that could be used (machine learning, heuristic search, etc.).
