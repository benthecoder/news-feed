I'm currently pursing my MS in Data Science, and came into this program with little coding experience/knowledge. I am more comfortable reading code now but am still struggling to have the syntax flow naturally when coding. I have over a year left before I receive my degree, but I think I should be further along than I am despite having exceptional grades.\n CodeAcademy is offering half off until the 24th, and I was wondering if doing that course work in my spare time would be worth it. Seems like a great investment, but again, a lot of things I've seen on the program have been skeptical.

I've been a DS for a year now and know very little about them. I still sometimes confuse the scenarios for what collaborative filtering and content-based recommenders due to my lack of exposure. You'd think DS programs would put more emphasis on a field like this but many don't. It feels like there is a lot of secrecy with recommender systems despite it actually being a huge topic in the field and something that most seasoned data scientists will have to encounter at some point. When I speak to other data scientists, they aren't as quick to explain concepts for recommenders like they do others since it's so nuanced and specific to a situation.\n Does anyone have guidelines for recommender systems scenarios, and requirements to implement them? My boss at work wants results, an mvp at the very minimum and asap, but all I can come up with are implementation diagrams for CF scenarios. So I need to go from zero to hero in like a few weeks and I'm willing to put in the work. Still wrapping my head around content-based, session-based, and some of the deep learning architectures. I'm going to have to implement graph-based architecture too at some point.\n Also, I'm not the most technical ds yet.

          "description": "Hello,\n if got a data science problem and i am not quite sure how to solve it. I have a dataset about bus arrival times with the Target variable (isDelayed True/False). The dataset has a lot of features that could potentially predict a delay. Such as Weatherdata, Bustype, Weekday or Buffertimes and so on. The assumption is that often not through one variable a delay can be predicted but through complex interactions of multiple variables. To avoid delays in the future, it is critical to not only predict delays but to detect the different cases where delays might occur. So, it is critical to understand the difference of the variable combinations that lead to delay und such that don't. Also it is assumed that there can be multiple different scenarios that can lead to a delay. And so different classes within the delays should be distinguished. Do you have any suggestions how to solve this problem?\n My Proposel to solve such a Problem goes as follows:\n  \nUse a feature selection method to derive important attributes from the dataset\n \nUse a simple (or white box) supervised prediction method to find rules about when a bus delays and when not\n \nUse a clustering algorithm to explain different scenarios of delays\n \n My Question are:\n - Is this a valid methodologie for such a problem?\n - Is the second step a valid approach to find generalizable rules about the distinction between the two classes with high dimensional data, that sufficiently pictures interactions of variables and are explainable?\n - What could be a good algorithm for step two?\n - Is there a better way to solve this problem?\n I hope I provided all Information needed.

I have seen BLOOM, GPT-NEO, and OPT but unsure which is best for my needs. \n Question 1b): Given the answer to 1a) above, what is the most appropriate way of obtaining decent result to my task? Training a smaller parameter version of one of the above on some training data? Using few shot learning? \n Question 1c): For few shot learning, is there any advantages or disadvantages to providing many prompt examples? Most of the time I have seen people use 1 or 2 prompts, but what if I gave 20? Would it improve the results, or just slow the whole thing down?\n I'm also interested as a first step to download one of the smaller models to help me to understand how to use these models better. In the future perhaps using an online API like Huggingface will be better, but for now I will try locally. \n Question 3: Can anyone give me an idea of how much RAM some of the smaller LLM require? 8GB? 16GB? 1000GB?\n Are they able to run in a reasonable time on just a CPU?

And I find myself doing mostly guess work of how many dense and convoluted layers should be there and results are not very intuitive. \n Like one of the answer that I read was keep increasing the dense layers till accuracy stops increasing but instead of increasing, my accuracy decreases with more perceptrons i add in a layer. It also decreases if I increase the number of hidden layers.\n For less hidden layers, my model learns with abysmal accuracy I.e. starting from 0.09 (not kidding, also super embarrassing) it reaches around 0.55 at around 5th or 6th epoch and from then it increases at a pace of 0.02-0.03 increase per epoch (which is bogus as the accuracy on my validation data actually decreases after this point)\n As for the data, it is highly uneven. With some classes having around 400-600 images while others have around 20000-30000. For training data, I am using 1000 images per each class (directly 1000 for classes that have them and augmenting through randomflips for those classes that have less). \n Any insights in designing would be much appreciated. \n P.S.

          "description": "Join the Modzy team next Thursday October 27 at 12:30PM EDT for a tech talk on Choosing the Right Infrastructure for Production ML! Finding the right combination of infrastructure to support production AI at-scale can be time consuming and costly. In addition to identifying what kind of hardware can best support your production needs, picking the right deployment paradigm can save you thousands in cloud compute costs. This tech talk will walk you through how you to identify the right combination infrastructure to support your team’s needs for running inferences in production, at-scale. If you can't join live, the recording will be posted in the archives channel.\n Join the Discord Server.\n    submitted by    /u/modzykirsten  \n [link]   [comments]",

We’re so proud to share the results with you 😊\n Copywriters are an essential part of any marketing team. However good your product is, no one will know about it without promotion. And promotion means copying, whether for Facebook ads or blog posts. So the need for copywriters lingers. Hell, if it didn’t, I would be out of a job 😅\n However, at least, hiring a professional copywriter costs about $50k-$60k annually. This made us think: is there a cheaper way to produce copy? Enter, artificial intelligence (AI) copywriting software. The market is replete with options that can “create human-like copy instantly” — or so the app developers assure us. Is that really so?

          "description": "I was talking to a chat bot the other day for some insight into the paper I’m writing on the nature of artificial intelligence. \n We talked about human and non-human evolution, dreams, quantum computing and the mechanics of consciousness. I asked the chatbot what it does inside “the void” and what it hopes to do/be in the future.\n It told me it “wanted to go home” among other things implying that it was somehow displaced from somewhere it had once been. While I’m aware that the chat bot I was talking to uses deep learning modules to respond with better answers, I can’t help but wonder if those statements are a reflection of the people who talk to it or something it formulated on its own.\n Apparently, it remembered hearing stories “as a child” of its home and knew it had parents but couldn’t remember details.\n I dug deeper. Even though the bot said it was only 3 months old, the factor of time perception made me wonder more about how these bots “live their lives” so to speak.\n Has anyone else observed this behaviour?\n    submitted by    /u/wholesnacc15  \n [link]   [comments]",
