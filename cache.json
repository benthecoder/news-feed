This was done to reduce the manual overhead of looking at all alerts individually. We also added the feature to club some alerts into a group and give them a name based on the type of event it is manually (so that they can be used as labels if we want to automate this in the future using ML/DL)\n Well now I have been asked to come up with a ML methodology to do exactly that, where if we recieve a certain set of alerts which are similar in nature to some previously classified group then they be automatically grouped. I have come up with some ideas on how to approach this problem but all of them have some overhead issues. \n Has anyone ever worked on something similar? I see that there are products out there which kind of do this but how should one go about in approaching such a problem?
