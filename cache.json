          "description": "With the current exodus from twitter, many of us are looking to migrate to Mastodon and similar ActivityPub servers. For the good of Fediverse, it is important that we migrate to diverse instances rather than join one of the most popular. In particular because other Fediverse instances can block your instance because of lax moderation policies. E.g. this. This is bad both because if you are in a blocked instance, then your toots no longer reach the people of that instance, and secondly, if you are in the particular instance that has blocked another, you may have no choice but to either agree to the moderator, or shift to another server and hope for the best.\nHowever, there is another solution that is not very difficult if you have about 15 minutes free. You can host your own instance, for free. Here is my write up on how to do that with (1) freemyip for free DNS, (2) letusencrypt or cloudshare for your free ssl certificate, and (3) oracle free tier to host the instance. The write up uses Kitstec which is a light weight singleuser ActivityPub server (using sqlite and filesystem backend). If you are using a custom domain, (e.g. as a front end for gmail), then it is even more easy.\nIf you end up doing this, please drop me a note at https://gopinath.org/",

Without personal insights, my logic is more ‘anything insurance related sounds boring’ and ‘public transport sounds cool’.
