It currently supports FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD. OpenBSD can run on x86-64 and ARM64, the other operating systems run on x86-64.\nSome of the features that are supported include:\n* Multiple operating system with one single action\n* Multiple versions of each operating system\n* Allows to use default shell or Bash shell\n* Low boot overhead\n* Fast execution\n* Runs on both macOS and Linux runners\nCompared to similar solutions like https://github.com/vmactions/freebsd-vm, the boot time is around a fifth and the full execution time for the same job is around half of freebsd-vm (last time I tried).\nThe readme contains more information about how it all works under the hood.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34404535\nPoints: 39\n# Comments: 12",

Using the `ask` interface you can get answers in natural language. Using the `howto` interface you can get get python and pandas code directly. The primary benefit of this over copilot and chatGPT is that this adds data-content based context so that the generated answers are much more accurate and relevant to the data problem at hand.\nCheck out the demo video[1] and try it out using the colab notebook (on github)!\n[1] https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/916073/212602281-4...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34400443\nPoints: 201\n# Comments: 46",

Graduated recently with a BSc in Physics & Astronomy from a top university, got a LinkedIn, a Github with some of my academic projects online, a decent array of skills: Python, SQL, and the standard DS libraries + some ML, web scraping and framework stuff. Completed an internship at a fintech startup last summer and gained some backend / data engineering experience.\n The problem is, I can't even land an interview. Like, I don't mean I get a few, I mean I haven't got A SINGLE ONE. Not seen a human face yet. What gives? Is this a reflection of the job market as a whole at the moment, or am I just considered a weak candidate because I don't have a Masters or a CS background?

          "description": "So I’m designing an AB Test to find out certain treatment’s impact on customer purchase frequency. The problem is that to reach desired p-value/power, we need a lot more customer in the experiment than we could afford to. \n Say if I ran the test for 90 days, the metric I’m testing is the number of orders for each customer over the 90 days. If I put 1000 customers in this experiment, that’s only 1000 observations (Customer X placed Y orders during the test period). The effect I’m trying to test is quite small and the STDEV of the order frequency is quite big. \n Then I had this idea, if I change the observation frequency, instead of “Customer X placed Y orders during the entire 90 days”, an observation becomes “Customer X place Y orders on Day Z”. Basically this changes the test metrics from “Orders per 90 days” to “Orders per each day”. This would give me 1000*90 = 9000 observations with the same customers and test period. I ran the numbers this would give me statistically significant result much sooner or with much fewer customers. \n My question is, is this a valid way of designing AB Test? It feels to me by observing a more granular metric, the test is made more sensitive to differences. But I’m not from very academic background and certainly not a statistician, any help is greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/slicevege  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am mainly interested in creating character sheets for 3D modelling like this:\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/7vv9zotsbfca1.jpg?width=564&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37df5fc0affb728338a3517d5710453b72b0830b\n Initially, I thought that training a model with a bunch of character sheets from google images would suffice. I figured if I used an image of a character (think general concept art, without the T-pose and different views) as the \"input\" image, it would spit out something resembling a character sheet, only with the character I want in it. This didn't work, it ended up re-imagining the character with the art style of the character sheet (hand drawn lines, cartoony):\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/rp6hh8qgdfca1.png?width=1486&format=png&auto=webp&s=81fb7607cbd58a938f25314c471772aaa5d8916c\n So I guess my question is: Is there an AI service/app/tool that might accomplish this?
