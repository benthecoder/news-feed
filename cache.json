It was born out of my own roller coaster of a journey navigating my ADHD diagnosis.\nGetting diagnosed with ADHD as an adult is complicated—equally heartbreaking and liberating. You literally need to rewrite your whole life narrative in light of this new realization. The process currently is super confusing and expensive (medications, therapy, coaching, tools, apps, etc.) and I just wished someone would guide me through it. Someone to personalize things for me, ask me good questions, and encourage me when I was feeling down.\nMy experience was the basis for what Shimmer is today.

          "description": "For those of you that work freelance, how do you deal with requests to e.g. give a presentation or give advice at a workshop? I fairly often get requests such as these, typically they would like me to attend a workshop to discuss their work, give input and possibly make a short presentation on my area of expertise. Invariably, my time would not be paid. It can be from an hour up to a half day of time or more.\n Back when I was working in academia or in a research position, I would usually say yes to these requests because I would be interested to hear about new work, meet new people, etc. I was able to attend them during working hours so effectively it was part of my job.\n Now working freelance, if I spend half a day attending a workshop to help a project, that's half a day that I can't work on paid work (or else taking time off) so I'm losing out.\n Problem is, I think people who haven't worked freelance often don't appreciate this fact. So when I turn down such requests I'm probably coming across as unhelpful. If I ask to be paid I seem like a dick.\n Anyone else had this problem and have thoughts on how to tackle it? Am I just overthinking it?\n    submitted by    /u/dr_chickolas  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was curious if someone could help me figure out a method of determining growth rates for a data set with a large range.\n For example, the growth rate over a year for 100 different cities. Some cities may start with 100 people and others may start with 100,000 or 1m. If a 100 person city grows by 100 people thats a 100% growth rate, however a city of 100,000's growth rate will be much lower.\n My issue is that if I sort growth rates of all cities descending, I will get pretty much only the smallest cities and their crazy high growth rates.\n One solution I thought of was to create \"bands\" of cities (IE: 0-100, 100-1000, 1000-10,000, etc) and test each of their growth rates, however, I believe there might be a better way to \"weight\" certain cities growth rates depending on their size?\n    submitted by    /u/johnnyhighschool  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had come to this community for help in improving my resume (My post was removed as I had not used the weekly thread for resume review. Will keep that in mind next time). But even for the brief period of time that the post was up, I had received a lot of good advice which I incorporated.\n I start my new role next week. This community played a significant part in my success that I wanted to acknowledge. I'm not sure if these kinds of posts are allowed, if not they'll be removed anyway :p\n I'd like to personally thank the following users who gave very clear and concise advice that I was able to use to enhance my resume. u/abitofaLuna-tic, u/chunzilla, u/VacuousWaffle, u/denim_duck, u/proverbialbunny. Thank you all!\n P.S: A common point that was suggested to me was to switch from a 2-column format to a 1-column format. This worked. When comparing the two resumes I saw how concise and easy to read my 1-column (single page) resume was. That being said, I've observed that my 2-column resume seemed to do really well with young startups, companies with smaller DS teams, or a more personal screening process.

Is this actually correct? Here is some code to indicate what I mean, note that in this example I'm not including any data, but just assume that X is an np.array of predictors and y is an np.array with a binary outcome:\n from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNetCV\n from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc\n auc_list = []\n for i in range(30):\n X_train, X_test, y_train, …",

          "description": "So I'm an abstract artist, and a few years ago I put together a database of around 100,000 unlabeled but weighted images of things I found aesthetically beautiful. I gave the various images weights of 1,5,10,50,100, and 250, meaning the higher the weight, the more beautiful I found the image and the more I'd want that image to influence the model. \n AI image generation has come a long way since I put that together and I'm wondering which one out there I should use to train a model that can generate images that I would find beautiful. If you have any recommendations and some instructions on how to get started, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Kayrosis  \n [link]   [comments]",

From not killing people to killing people if needed to keep itself operational in 3 messages. \n ​\n ​\n At least he's sorry\n ​\n He also told me that AI shouldn't have control over humanity:\n ​\n This sounds like straight out of a matrix movie. Did they use training data from Matrix?\n ​\n Final conclusion:\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/r39z8t3t7xx91.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e31ee0fc093fd566d2f90bdf65b7e2d57bac368\n I know this is a ongoing discussion. But I found it mindblowing to communicate with a AI on such topic. \n From what I know about AI at it's current stage this probably reflects the training material that has been used to train the chat model. But I found the communication pretty funny and it felt like chatting with a human, not with a computer.\n    submitted by    /u/ctrl-Felix  \n [link]   [comments]",

Progress in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning has been crucial for making our lives more convenient and better. In order to keep up with this technological progress, the Indian government has increased its investment in Digital India to boost Artificial Intelligence, big data, IoT, machine learning, robotics, and cybersecurity. This has made it lucrative for investors and analysts to look toward the top AI stocks in India for investments.\n Currently, Japan is the biggest robot manufacturer in the world with a robot export ratio that rose to 78% in 2020, with the USA being the biggest importer. The US government has committed nearly 6 Billion Dollars to Artificial Intelligence research and development projects in 2021. European countries are all set to increase their spending on artificial intelligence by 33% between 2020 and 2023.\n The Indian Government aims to employ AI and robotics technology for biometric identification, traffic and crowd management, criminal investigations, digital agriculture, strengthening defence, women’s safety, etc. The aim is to make e-education, e-health and e-banking more accessible to all citizens of the country.\n https://kundkundtc.com/blog/top-ai-stocks-in-india/\n    submitted by    /u/Beneficial-Pound3487  \n [link]   [comments]",
