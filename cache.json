          "description": "From the preface;\nI have also written this book with working programmers in mind. Many of them may have not had a formal computer science education, or at least one that included a proper introduction to programming languages. At some point, like that 90% of students, some of them become curious about the media they use. I want this book to speak to them, gently drawing them away from the hustle and bustle of daily programming into a space of reflection and thought.\nShriram Krishnamurthi, Brown University\nhttps://www.plai.org/\nComments",

          "description": "Hello all,\nVery excited to share this project with you all!\nPanoptisch scans your Python file or module to find it's imports (aka dependencies) and recursively does so for all dependencies and sub-dependencies. It then generates a dependency tree in JSON for you to parse and enforce import policies.\nSupply chain attacks are no joke, and this is one way to transparently analyze your dependencies to see if any malicious imports are taking place. For example, your yaml parser, nor it's sub-dependencies should import socket, or sys.\nPanoptisch is in early stages, with known limitations (for now). I welcome feedback, testing and contributions.\nAlso, happy to answer any questions!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33926782\nPoints: 34\n# Comments: 4",

The framework is easy to get started with even without previous web dev experience and is completely open source / free to use.\nWe made Pynecone for Python devs who want to make web apps, but don’t want the overhead of having to learn or use Javascript. We wanted more flexibility than existing Python frameworks like Streamlit/Dash that don't allow the user to make real, customizable web apps.\nWith Pynecone, you can make anything from a small data science/python project to a full-scale, multi page web app.  We have over 60+ built-in components and are adding more.\nWe are actively trying to grow this project so no matter you skill level we welcome contributions!

          "description": "I did a DS/machine learning bootcamp a few years back and it's served me well job-wise: I have the full DS title with great pay. However, I am now contemplating a masters or Ph.D........ It's one thing to know python/sci-kit learn and the conceptual basics of how ML/deep learning models work via a bootcamp/self-study, but it's another thing entirely to deeply know the intricacies of neural network architecture and how to do higher-level computer vision projects etc etc, if you catch my drift. I'm contemplating getting an MS CS or PhD with a focus on ML/AI (or maybe MS DS....) to maybe try to pivot more into ML Engineering or at least get a DS job with less analytics and more ML. I know I could try to pick up personal ML projects/ML projects at my current job but I'm not sure if it's sufficient enough to transition to where ML is the focus of my time.\n Has anyone had success from a BootCamp and still gone back to school anyway? Why/why not? Grad school is a lot of time and money, and because I'm already making a decent amount the ROI would only be the pursuit of my interests rather than monetary value/title. Have any BootCamp grads made the switch from DS to MLE? How did you do it? Are personal projects/self-study/MOOCs enough? \n I know a lot of the BootCamp vs grad school discourse has been beaten to death on this subreddit but I'm in need of a bit of guidance. Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/Dkdk6fish  \n [link]   [comments]",
