          "description": "I understand that you need to do Power analysis in order to figure out what sample size you need for your AB test, but something that I have difficulty coming up with is “what MDE should we use?” Researching online hasn’t been much help because all I see are examples of where they just give an MDE to use but don’t explain the process of getting there. \n For my company, a lot of our tests have very low operational costs, so in almost all cases any positive performance is worth rolling out. Basically, even if we saw only a 0.05% lift, if it was statistically significant, we’d probably implement the change. This has led me down a path where I basically just check to see what MDE we can reasonably detect given the number of users coming into the platform INSTEAD of determining what MDE is actually valuable. I feel like this is the wrong approach, but I’m unsure what else to do given that our “goal” MDE is basically anything above 0. This especially makes it difficult for me to determine when I should stop the tests as well, other than picking a somewhat arbitrary end point of 3-4 weeks and then seeing if there is any directional value from the data. \n What would you do in this situation? How do you determine the MDE for your AB tests? \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/matt22022  \n [link]   [comments]",

So it might be, that experts from these decades are already spread through the industry.\n NLP in comparison is pretty new and on high demand without a doubt.\n Does someone has insights for me on the demand of the industry on Bayesian-ML in Control Engineering?

In our first interaction, he bragged about how he created a segmentation model using a random forest with an accuracy of 94% in his previous role ...\n I was previously leading our team of 3 DS and 2 DE. It is quite blurred how we will collaborate and divide the roles, management responsibilities, and workload.\n It is still early days, but I wanted to get insights and advice from the community, from people who have been in a similar situation. I've done a few google searches on this topic and haven't found anything. Maybe everyone out there has competent and knowledgeable data science leads/managers? It could be the case, as I guess you can't fake being a data science lead and get away with it, can you?\n  \nHow do senior data scientists learn and are mentored by lead data scientists in your organizations? Is there a way to check informally if this guy has knowledge/skills that I can really pick up and learn from him?\n Should I transfer to him all my management responsibilities and the projects I own?\n Any advice about how to cope with this situation, especially during his first 100 days would be gold.

          "description": "Hi, I am wondering about about some recent trends I have been experienced at work with younger or less experienced data scientists.\n People are fitting these large multivariate, nonlinear models that come directly from python libraries, for example PyOD outlier detection. They just compare results from all the built in ML algos. They don't think about any simple methods what so ever for detecting outliers. However, the end user always drills down to univariate to see if the features are significant anyway. So I don't see the purpose in testing the advanced algos without a baseline.\n So instead of starting with a basic statistical outlier method, or univariate or linear method,like PCA, all of this is skipped and considered irrelevant or \"dinosaur\". \n My argument is that if you don't have a baseline simple method, you will never understand the benefit the ML algo brings . Basically if they cant can't find a benefit over univariate , they shouldn't promote the advanced methods yet.\n What are your thoughts on this?\n How do I convince these people to slow down and take baby steps to see the benefits without insulting them? \n How do I stop ignorant management from listening to these trendy individuals? Its quite frustrating when a simple method beats a complex desired method, but someone won't listen because they want to look smart.\n    submitted by    /u/Atxaquariguy  \n [link]   [comments]",

In this post I do only want to talk about CNN's which are used to learn images\n I know that CNN's (convolutional neural networks) do consist of a few layers which proccess an image in the first part, being followed by one ore more fully connected layers, which indeed act like a classical feed-forward neural network.\n So in the first part of a CNN, there are one or more stacks of a convolutional layer being followed by a pooling layer. After 1 or more repetitions of a convolutional layer together with a pooling layer, the first part ends with a flatten operation, which does now transform t…",

I've come to accept that. Cartoon Network is what I grew up on, but it's alright if kids today grow up on other animation studios. Or even more realistically the direction things are headed, animation studios probably won't be a thing. Digital art is going displace a lot of the work in the space. An artist can create a style for a series and AI will be able to replicate it.
