A little background of me; I’ve recently graduated from Dental Hygiene School, and have a B.A. in Biology. \n I’ve had a rough start in my hygiene career, but thankfully landed at a great clinic along an amazing team. \n Dental Hygiene takes a huge toll on the body overtime, and I may have a rheumatoid condition. It’s put a few things in perspective, and I might wanna veer away from the career and move towards something else.\n I’ve studied biology and in the midst I’ve taken classes for Stats and Calculus and really enjoyed it. I’ve never coded and have no real computer knowledge outside of PC gaming, plus I can be lazy at times and have difficulty problem solving individually. I enjoy presenting, and love explaining things in ways for people to understand what I’m talking about. I ask a lot of questions in regards to how and why things are done in specific ways. One big driving force for me is having a team to support \n For those who have more insight in this realm of careers,you think someone like me could potentially be a great data scientist?\n    submitted by    /u/Klijong_Kabadu  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve then taken two lists of words with their affect value (-1 to 1) and arousal value same scale.

I'm almost certain that in the near future, AI will be better than any human at any skilled task. AI will have the ability to start companies, make amazing original music, movies, video games, etc. I'm not trying to be pessimistic or dramatic or anything, I'm just making a claim based on what I know and how fast I've seen this technology develop. Then you start to wonder, well, if in society, we value skill, and we pay money for skilled work and time, what happens when there is not longer a scarcity of skill, and a machine can do in seconds what it would take an MIT graduate to do in hours, days, months, or even years? How will our society operate? I actually don't know. I think its very probable that everything will fall apart.
