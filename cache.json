          "description": "The demise of Moore’s Law has led to the rise of hardware acceleration. However, the focus on accelerating stable algorithms in their entirety neglects the abundant fine-grained acceleration opportunities available in broader domains and squanders host processors’ compute power. This paper presents Duet, a scalable, manycore-FPGA architecture that promotes embedded FPGAs (eFPGA) to be equal peers with processors through non-intrusive, bi-directionally cache-coherent integration. In contrast to existing CPU-FPGA hybrid systems in which the processors play a supportive role, Duet unleashes the full potential of both the processors and the eFPGAs with two classes of post-fabrication enhancements: fine-grained acceleration, which partitions an application into small tasks and offloads the frequently-invoked, compute-intensive ones onto various small accelerators, leveraging the processors to handle dynamic control flow and less accelerable tasks; hardware augmentation, which employs eFPGA-emulated hardware widgets to improve processor efficiency or mitigate software overheads in certain execution models. An RTL-level implementation of Duet is developed to evaluate the architecture with high fidelity. Experiments using synthetic benchmarks show that Duet can reduce the processor-accelerator communication latency by up to 82% and increase the bandwidth by up to 9.5x. The RTL implementation is further evaluated with seven application benchmarks, achieving 1.5-24.9x speedup.\narXiv\nComments",

          "description": "The applicability of lattice reduction to a wide variety of cryptographic situations makes it an important part of the cryptanalyst’s toolbox. Despite this, the construction of lattices and use of lattice reduction algorithms for cryptanalysis continue to be somewhat difficult to understand for beginners. This tutorial aims to be a gentle but detailed introduction to lattice-based cryptanalysis targeted towards the novice cryptanalyst with little to no background in lattices. We explain some popular attacks through a conceptual model that simplifies the various components of a lattice attack.\nArchive\nComments",

I spent my twenties bouncing all over the place; did a stint in the Army Reserves while shooting for liutenant bars that didn't work out (failed out of college and I was in ROTC).

Not so hot to watch my age group get raises and salary increases.\nI have my GED and never finished college - left with a record-setting 1.2 GPA (I have severe ADD and I wasn't properly medicated, there were other problems too).

Rather the focus is: - strong understanding of conceptual ML, statistics - ability to code in SQL to pull data (huge importance) - ability to code in Python/R to create models - genuine curiosity and drive to get answers. - Ability to frame and understand the business problem \n I’m currently doing a masters in analytics and after a series of SQL, Python, Machine Learning and Statistics courses I have a decent grasp of everything above. I am far from an expert coder and don’t generally have coding memorized from the top of my head - I do require the internet. However, I have a decent ability to use code to perform data engineering, data cleaning, data visualization, data modelling. Just not at a level of a computer science student for example. \n But my worry is mainly that if I get handed an algorithm leetcode type question in an interview for Data Science, I’ll fail. So wanted to understand people’s opinion on this as I am a soon to be graduating and am looking for a job in data science.\n    submitted by    /u/telaitpaday  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there a chance that a company would be interested in me, or am I misusing my time at this point by applying now?

However, with the recent trend of moving away from TensorFlow and towards PyTorch, I wonder if TensorFlow and other ML frameworks are still worth learning today. I know certain algorithms are exclusively implemented in one or the other framework.\n I think at least TensorFlow is good since they’re well-documented and put to the test by other experts. But I’m not so sure about the case of newer custom frameworks. If I dive into them, it could be a step back for me especially after reading this article. It talks about newer ML framework launches and how a lot of people try it out at first, but then interest in said frameworks starts to decrease.\n I know there are a bunch of good custom frameworks out there but it might take more time for new tools to become mainstream or eventually die down. Which is why I’m afraid to use them at the moment. Let me know what you all think! Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ActionParticular7697  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a rapidly growing field within the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is revolutionizing the way we interact with machines. NLP is a branch of AI that deals with the interaction between human language and computers. It is used to analyze, understand and generate human language, and it has a wide range of applications in various industries.\n One of the most significant advancements in NLP is the development of deep learning algorithms, which have greatly improved the accuracy and efficiency of NLP models. These algorithms have enabled the development of more sophisticated NLP systems, such as those that can understand context and generate human-like responses.\n One of the most prominent applications of NLP is in the customer service industry.

          "description": "Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11711\n Abstract: \n  \nRecent progress in generative models, especially in text-guided diffusion models, has enabled the production of aesthetically-pleasing imagery resembling the works of professional human artists. However, one has to carefully compose the textual description, called the prompt, and augment it with a set of clarifying keywords. Since aesthetics are challenging to evaluate computationally, human feedback is needed to determine the optimal prompt formulation and keyword combination. In this paper, we present a human-in-the-loop approach to learning the most useful combination of prompt keywords using a genetic algorithm. We also show how such an approach can improve the aesthetic appeal of images depicting the same descriptions.\n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/ei4wm8tv66da1.png?width=1852&format=png&auto=webp&s=e20c196fe9a543e6b4ec58b3d4f689624db7f95d\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Mine_5742  \n [link]   [comments]",
