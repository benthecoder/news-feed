          "description": "Full Abstract from PDF:\nMetadata updates, such as file creation and block allocation, have consistently been identified\nas a source of performance, integrity, security, and availability problems for file systems. Soft\nupdates is an implementation technique for low-cost sequencing of fine-grained updates to\nwrite-back cache blocks. Using soft updates to track and enforce metadata update dependen-\ncies, a file system can safely use delayed writes for almost all file operations. This article\ndescribes soft updates, their incorporation into the 4.4BSD fast file system, and the resulting\neffects on the system. We show that a disk-based file system using soft updates achieves\nmemory-based file system performance while providing stronger integrity and security guar-\nantees than most disk-based file systems. For workloads that frequently perform updates on\nmetadata (such as creating and deleting files), this improves performance by more than a\nfactor of two and up to a factor of 20 when compared to the conventional synchronous write\napproach and by 4 –19% when compared to an aggressive write-ahead logging approach. In\naddition, soft updates can improve file system availability by relegating crash-recovery\nassistance (e.g., the fsck utility) to an optional and background role, reducing file system\nrecovery time to less than one second.\nCategories and Subject Descriptors: C.4 [Computer Systems Organization]: Performance of\nSystems—Design studies; Reliability, availability, and serviceability; C.5.5 [Computer Sys-\ntem Implementation]: Servers; D.4.2 [Operating Systems]: Storage Management; D.4.3\n[Operating Systems]: File Systems Management; E.5 [Data]: Files; H.3.2 [Information\nStorage and Retrieval]: Information Storage\nComments",

It’s written in Python, and can be used from the command-line, or as a Python library.\nWe just released data-diff 0.3.0, which added support for faster diff when both tables are in the same database.

          "description": "Our Hosting provider, Hetzner, has recently started charging for public IPv4 addresses - as they should! Those numbers started getting expensive. This prompted me to try and set up a new server cluster using IPv6 exclusively, and see how far I could get before having to give in and purchase an additional v4 address.\nThe experiment ended much sooner than I had anticipated. Some of the road blocks I hit along the way:\n  - The GitHub API and its code load endpoints are not reachable via IPv6, making it impossible to download release artefacts from many projects, lots of which distribute their software via GitHub exclusively (Prometheus for instance).\n  - The default Ubuntu key servers aren't reachable via IPv6, making it difficult to install packages from third-party registries, such as Docker or Grafana. While debugging, I noticed huge swaths of the GPG infrastructure are defunct: There aren't many key servers left at all, and the only one I found actually working via IPv6 was pgpkeys.eu.\n  - BitBucket cannot deploy to IPv6 hosts, as pipelines don't support IPv6 at all. You can self-host a pipeline runner and connect to it via v6, BUT it needs to have a dual stack - otherwise the runner won't start.\n  - Hetzner itself doesn't even provide their own API via IPv6 (which we talk to for in-cluster service discovery. Oh, the irony.\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33894933\nPoints: 480\n# Comments: 453",

The easiest way to subset the data would be to limit the time period, for example, just taking November and December from two consecutive years, and treat the last two weeks of December as the \"test\" data -- hold it out, ask the model to forecast what it should be, and then compare those results to the actual values. \n An alternative, which would be much harder to prepare the data for, would be to look at a subset of the points geographically -- for example, just look at traffic between a very limited number of endpoints.\n My question is, would forecasting methods work properly if the time span in the data set has gaps in it?

I've heard back from a few, and even had late-stage interviews as well with many.\n Out of all of them, one company, a relatively large healthcare-based company interviewed me, and the interviewer (in the 3rd round) asked me, among many other things, data structures and algorithms questions... stacks and queues etc. \n Just wanted the community's opinion on: 1. Do you guys face this too in your region? 2. Experienced DS/DA: do you guys use advanced DSA topics at any time? 3. Do you think its worth learning DSA for data science?\n    submitted by    /u/Waitlam  \n [link]   [comments]",

As with technology as a whole in civilization, AI is progressing faster and could progress much faster than we can acclimate. By handing off the bureaucratic reigns of things like content curation, job/school admissions, phone service call centers, among other societal functions to AI, we will depersonalize and dehumanize the workings of human civilization for the sake of \"efficiency\" and \"productivity\".\n Think about it this way, if you're born in the age of AI in lower to middle class, you grow up with the same cohort of people.

The U.S. Department of Energy has established a Rare Earths Supply Chain Technology and Critical Materials Institute to research, develop, and deploy materials processing technologies and systems. In addition, the Energy Department has funded research projects to explore the potential for domestic rare earths production. The U.S. Geological Survey is also involved in researching the potential for domestic rare earths production. The mining industry has also been actively involved in exploring the potential for domestic rare earths production. The American Exploration & Mining Association has established a Rare Earths Task Force to study the issue and provide recommendations. Environmental advocates have been working with the government and industry to ensure that any domestic rare earths production is done responsibly. Several environmental groups have expressed support for domestic rare earths production, as long as it is done in a sustainable manner. ]\n    submitted by    /u/JeffJHornEsq  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I spent $6 on using GPT3.5 today from OpenAI. I am a senior in college. I thought AIs were dumb/incapable/crude until this past week…\n When the whole Lensa AI “Magic Avatars” based on Subtle Diffusion took Instagram by storm and I started doing my research and got hooked. I’ve dallied with DALE but found the true temptation in GPT3.5\n Of course, GPT3.5 and ChatGPT just came out, and while ChatGPT is great for most conversational stuff… GPT3.5 is a powerhouse.\n It is so extremely dynamic. I fed it an 1820’s family’s household budget and it was able to generate the price of 77 items back in that time period.That’s a very specific topic I’m sure I’ve tried to google at least twenty times before and had never found such quantity and at such speed as GPT3.5 can. It cuts through so much bullshit…",

The plans give specifics about elements, measurements, temperatures, pressure, materials, software/hardware requirements, and instructions to build the aforementioned. It also explains concepts in terms that most High School Seniors could probably understand. Obviously, I would never use these and it would be practically impossible to anyway, but if I can basically obtain instructions for this, imagine what others could find out plans for. I've purged all of this information and mean no harm but wanted to raise the issue to prevent others who aren't like me. I'm also hesitant to explain how I did this out of fear that others may misuse it, but the moderators can message me and I will provide proof.\n ------\n Edit 1: Title should read \"... - Precedent is Dangerous\"\n    submitted by    /u/InfiniteAxon  \n [link]   [comments]",
