          "description": "I’ve been in the MLOps space for ~10 years, and data is still the hardest unsolved open problem. Code is versioned using Git, data is stored somewhere else, and context often lives in a 3rd location like Slack or GDocs. This is why we built XetHub, a platform that enables teams to treat data like code, using Git.\nUnlike Git LFS, we don’t just store the files. We use content-defined chunking and Merkle Trees to dedupe against everything in history. This allows small changes in large files to be stored compactly. Read more here: https://xethub.com/assets/docs/how-xet-deduplication-works\nToday, XetHub works for 1 TB repositories, and we plan to scale to 100 TB in the next year. Our implementation is in Rust (client & cache + storage) and our web application is written in Go. XetHub includes a GitHub-like web interface that provides automatic CSV summaries and allows custom visualizations using Vega. Even at 1 TB, we know downloading an entire repository is painful, so we built git-xet mount - which, in seconds, provides a user-mode filesystem view over the repo.\nXetHub is available today (Linux & Mac today, Windows coming soon) and we would love your feedback!\nRead more here:\n- https://xetdata.com/blog/2022/10/15/why-xetdata\n- https://xetdata.com/blog/2022/12/13/introducing-xethub\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33969908\nPoints: 216\n# Comments: 131",

I haven’t really been keeping up on the developments, but let’s just say you guys have my attention once again.\n If you had asked me 2 weeks ago if we were approaching a technological Utopia, I would have bluntly told you “No”.\n However, the past two weeks have been quite an eye opener, and I am very impressed.\n It started with chat gpt, and open AI chatbots. Their capabilities are impossible to deny, and it will be disruptive technology moving forward.\n However, with the announcement of Nuclear Fusion Reactions being achieved.. I dug a bit deeper. Many of the diagnostic and laser control systems recently had huge improvements made on the back of AI.\n And again, today with the announcement of solid state battery breakthroughs, which with all likelihood also reached beyond decades old barriers on the back of AI.\n The past 2 weeks, feels like we may have gone to the moon 3 times, and I would be highly suspicious that they are all independent, isolated advancements in their own domains.\n Progress like this doesn’t come out of nowhere, and it really seems as if AI is that common thread pushing us past our previous boundaries.\n    submitted by    /u/Somnow87  \n [link]   [comments]",

But the offer seems good, since I like the project.\n The project is in a field known as open-set recognition, also known simply as novelty detection. It isn't the most active field in research, but there are some interesting papers here and there.\n I now need to find a university professor to supervise me. and I have some questions that you may give me some useful insights on:\n - is an industrial PhD worth it? I may have some limitations concerning the amount of theoretical research I could carry, since the company, in the end, is interested in a finished product.\n - what should I look for in a supervisor?\n - is a PhD in the AI field truly needed? Or should I be better off working for a few companies during the next years and improving my engineering skills?\n I know that these questions are very person-dependent, but if you have any personal experiences that may help me, I would be glad to hear.

Without the need of learning Python or super complex Java Libraries.\n This is not for companies who search a full product, this is for people who like to code for fun and just want something to play around with in the complex and packed AI-World. \n Here is a tutorial using this framework to predict diabetes: https://easy-ml.gitbook.io/easy-ml-for-java/fundamentals/implement-your-first-ai \n Please also look at the GitHub repository and leave some feedback about code and design.
