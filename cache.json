Basically, we’re a “Spotify”, but for games made by independent creators on PC.\nPaulo and I have been indie gamers for the past decade. Both of us have insanely long back catalogs of games we’ve always wanted to try, but couldn’t. When we were stuck at home during covid, we were frustrated and decided to set out to solve this problem. Naturally, this decision was made during a game of Call of Duty: Warzone.\nFor consumers, MagnaPlay eliminates the paywall when it comes to buying a new game. Today, the indie market is incredibly saturated and prices are increasing. A subscription service, like Spotify, can make indie gaming more affordable and allow players to try out more content.\nFor…",

I have always been a fan of lower-level languages and disliked abstraction so this inspired me to work on my own library but related to mathematics in a broader sense (that also includes machine learning methods and techniques).\n The source code being all in C++, formal installation with CMake, language binding for Python with easy installation using pip, a binding for R, and some decent documentation and samples to get running, this led me to start using the project for some Machine Learning work in my research lab.

I am thinking about what I want to do and one of those possibilities is data analytics. \n I really enjoy learning and analyzing data and statistics. I also like figuring out why trends emerge.\n However I am not experienced in this field at all. The only class even remotely related to this was my high school statistics class that was so easy a kindergartener could do it. I am also not very good at algebra and I have never tried calculus yet (pre calculus was hard for me (especially because it was during the pandemic)). Another issue is that I can’t code. I have heard that coding can be very important to the field and so that’s another worry. \n The final thing to note is that I am not very interested in business. If I went into data analytics I would not want to do business analytics. Rather I would like to do research analytics. Is this a stable field or no?\n Thanks for the help\n    submitted by    /u/TheBlazingFire123  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would love to hear what people here think. \n To give you my specific example: what I'm trying to do is go from a dataframe or series of dataframes (in R, or python) to an end product in Excel for nontechnical users. The .xlsx will have different tabs with different slices of data in the tables - change over time, different demographic views, and so on. \n There is no alternative to a .xlsx output (i.e. Tableau or some other tool). \n The final formatted output should include at least the following characteristics: different colors for different column headers, filters at the top of tables, multiple tabs, conditional formatting. \n If any of you have done something like this before I'd love to hear your take on the best tool / packages / workflow to get this done.

          "description": "We recently formed a small data science team working on big data projects related to e-commerce. Now, I, as the supervisor, am thinking about how to maintain productive teamwork among us. Regarding toolsets, we have options like google cloud, AWS, GitLab, Trello, Slack, and Jira, where required. \n I have the following specific concerns:\n  \nHow can we collaborate on the same piece of code? For example, I want to check the code DS1 has written and modify or comment on it and also use it myself where needed. Is it better to use GitLab, Jupiter notebooks, google colab, or AWS sagemker?\n How can one DS quickly share the result of his/her EDA analysis with others instead of exporting the figure as an image and sending it to the slack channel? Should we use Jupiter/google notebooks, google Sheets/data studio/AWS quicksight, python code on GitLab, or any better idea?\n Our data is stored in our on-premises local servers as CSV files. For prototyping phases, I batch download a specific period of it to my local drive as raw data. Then I run my ETL pipeline on the local version each time I want to try an EDA analysis or an ML algorithm. How can we change this pipeline to be convenient for teamwork? Does each DS need its own personalized ETL pipeline? or is it better to create an archive of ETL codes that each DS can call based on the need? Should we store the results of specific ETLs on the Cloud to be more accessible to others and also prevent having different results by each DSs? \n Any other tools to improve the productivity of a data science team?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/babak_hss  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mind you, you don't have to commit to one or the other, but it will show up on your diploma if you complete the course requirements for either path.\n Every course in the program appears to be extremely valuable, but unfortunately I can't take them all. I was leaning towards doing the DS/ML path, but there are courses in the BA path that DO NOT intersect with the DS/ML path. \n My question is - which course would give me more value overall? \n Here's an example of a course tradeoff:\n  \n Data Science in Business - Taught in R, focuses on identifying, formulating and solving business problems\n  \nOR \n  \nApplied Machine Learning - Taught in Python, focuses on neural networks and deep learning, including an emphasis on model selection and tuning \n  \nI know Applied ML sounds much more rigorous and \"cool\", but in terms of how much I'll be using that in the real world - would it provide more value than DS in Business in the real world?\n    submitted by    /u/HercHuntsdirty  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear all,\n I've been building a codon optimizer (translating amino acids to DNA codons) using the transformer model 'Attention is all you need'. I've been training it on 1,5 million tokens. As the image shows the loss is stuck and very stable at 1.05, even after 4000 epochs (see figure A). When I use the model for interference I see that it does a lot right, how ever it seems not possible for it to find the <EOS> token. Figure B shows my inference with the bold tokens showing the desired length. It goes all the way untill it reaches the max_len constraint. The average length of the translated sequence is 300 tokens and a maximum of 1000 tokens. My questions: How can I stimulate the model to find the <EOS>? Since the length of the source is always the same length as the target can I hard code the EOS, would this help? Do I have enough tokens to train on or should i get more? If you need more information I can provide it :)\n Thank you for helping me out,\n Greetings from the Netherlands,\n Daan\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/r40zme9a7sba1.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c2ac0b84ea83bf58920e1d482ee240574d0c3b5\n    submitted by    /u/Defiant-Nobody642  \n [link]   [comments]",

It’s sort of like chat-gpt.\n We’d appreciate it if you could try it out and let us know your thoughts: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bright-eye/id1593932475\n    submitted by    /u/True-Marketing-5079  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey guys, I've run across one really great piece of news. I would love to discuss it with you.\n The fact that neural network technology is accelerating, as hardware that mimics neuron-connecting tissue copies brain functions such as learning and decision-making, memristive devices which mimic neuron synapses could be the next big leap for AI.\n The definition in this article would be: \"Memristors, or memory resistors, are switches that remember which electric state they were in prior to being turned off.\"\n So, today scientists aim to use memristors to build electronic neurons which can both compute and store data. These devices could also greatly increase energy efficiency over conventional microchips, which inefficiently transport data back and forth between processors and memory in traditional computers.\n \"Brain-inspired neural hardware could also find usage in analyzing medical data sets and scans or empower autonomous vehicles beyond their current capabilities.\"\n Isn't that awesome? It's like Sci-Fi, right?\n Still, current devices rely on emerging tech, which are somewhat unreliable. To overcome these challenges, Israeli and Chinese researchers created memristive devices also known as silicon synapses.\n All of this sound pretty confusing but it's all well explained in the article above.\n Let me know what you think.\n    submitted by    /u/AlexiReynolds  \n [link]   [comments]",
