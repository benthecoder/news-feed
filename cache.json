          "description": "Hi all,\n Since a lot of people appreciate the softer side of data science (based on my previous post, I am back with another 10 tips. \n ​\n In most professional settings, it is not enough to be right.\n You have to be helpful.\n This means that you have to give more than just an answer. \n You have to help your client understand where the answer is coming from.\n ​\n Note: A client can be a manager, colleague, or an actual paying client. \n ​\n Here are 10 things that I learned:\n 1. The client wants someone that will take away their worries and absorb problems.\n Be that person.\n 2. Help the client understand why your analysis makes sense.\n Give them reasons.\n 3. When presenting a recommendation, change statements into questions.\n “I would suggest X because of Y. Does this make sense to you?”\n 4. When starting a new project, rephrase your client's problem to make sure you both understand each other.\n “So you think your customers are leaving because of bad customer service? Is that correct?”\n 5. Before you can help someone, you have to understand what’s on their mind.\n Ask a lot of questions, shut up and listen.\n 6. Don’t assume someone is a mind reader.\n Say what you think, but try to word it in a constructive way. Just saying that something is dumb is not helpful. Explain why the idea will not work, and come up with a new idea that you together can build upon.\n 7. Take notes during meetings and review them before the next meeting.\n This will make sure there are no surprises.\n 8. If you like working with someone, say it.\n It builds the relationship which helps in collaboration. Do this only if you mean it though.\n 9. Almost everyone on every level in a serious profession feels imposter syndrome.\n Trust yourself; you know more than you do.\n 10. The key to solving problems is curiosity.\n Focus on what you don’t know, instead of what you know and keep asking questions.\n ​\n I hope you found this useful and good luck with your projects!\n    submitted by    /u/thomasvarekamp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "To sharpen my stats for my job interviews next month, I'm trying test all kinds of things so it stays fresh in my brain. Video game ranks of myself vs the whole, how can I estimate a number I don't have access to?\n ​\n My own AC130 zombie target practice\n So I play that game 'Zombie Gunship' where you play the gunner in an AC130 Gunship, where you have the 105mm howitzer, 40mm grenade, and the 25mm gatling gun.\n The stats I want to estimate is if I am ranked 16,363 of 432,369 globally, I have 1107 kills, how can we estimate the top 1%, and how can we estimate the top player... in general.\n Ok, so I know these variables.\n Given:\n p=population = 432,369\n s=sampled rank 16,363 to 11,542\n n = 4,821 steps in rank\n r1 = 16,353 ~ 0.0378449889 or top 3.7% \n r2 = 11,542 ~0.0266947908 or top 2.6%\n r3 = 1\n k1 = 1107\n k2 = 1178\n This is a two sample, known population, known proportion, and its ranked... which still doesn't solve for guessing the #1 players zombie kills. If we lowball the guess and say its linear how can we estimate it? Two sample proportion estimation formula here from our class. https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat800/lesson/5/5.5\n ​\n two sample formula\n The formula I'm thinking is phat-p0 divided by sqroot of ( p0(1-p0))/n or 0.037844-0.026694 = 0.01115 which matches the same proportion of 4821/432,369 = 0.0111501.\n So 0.01115/sqrt(0.026694(1-0.026694)) then divide that by 4821 which gives me a z=4.8029. That sort of makes sense it would be four times the std deviation but we don't know what the distribution of total kills are so k1 and k2 are nice to have but useless unless I went into python to code up some linear estimator. So its maybe accurate math but doesn't fit the distribution.\n So what are the other options to estimate this?\n I can click the app and have it tell me what the top players stats are but I want to guess.\n    submitted by    /u/Your_Data_Talking  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi community!\n Work in a field with lots of machinery where pumps and compressors reliability has direct impact on the bottomline. See a lot of new companies coming to offer the holy grail in terms of predictive maintenance using \"analytics\", but they are seldom able to live up to expectations or can't simply provide tangible evidence to go for a trial. We also have an internal Data Science team testing published methods, replicating work from other companies, etc and results are more or less the same: when applied to real data, nothing really adds value over properly performed condition monitoring (*). Then read plenty of academic articles (like this example https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/1/291/pdf?version=1640946584) where their conclusions seem to match ours (methods work nicely on perfect synthetic data, but fall sort in real life production).\n Data-wise, we could always ask for more instruments to be installed, but we have a reasonable amount of history on key performance variables. Vibration sensors are not installed on every pump/compressor, but where we have them (in really critical machines) it doesn't really make a difference. \n So, not to sound like I'm just whining, anyone out there really succeeding in the subject of applying ML methods to predict equipment failures well in advance?\n (*) Some companies come showing \"success stories\" where instrumenting and monitoring a key temperature \"helped the operator save millions of dollars\". That's not what I'm referring to; in my book that's not ML-enabled predictive maintenance...that's basic condition monitoring not being done in first place.\n    submitted by    /u/Trostis  \n [link]   [comments]",
