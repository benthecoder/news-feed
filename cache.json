          "description": "I created a system for building SVG-only websites called Svija.  But, though the content was nice, the sites felt too static — a bit flat and lifeless. Even a basic HTML website has mouseover effects, but SVG doesn't have them for free the way HTML does.\nI wanted to find an easy way to recreate mouseover functionality in SVG. For my first try, I labeled objects in Adobe Illustrator:\n  • linkSomeName: an invisible link  (over the link text)\n  • mouseoverSomeName: a  mouseover decoration (usually bold or colored text, or an underline), initially hidden\n\nOnce I had used it for a bit, I thought that it might be nicer if the effects faded in and out. So, I tried animating the transitions with GSAP. It immediately became clear that there was enormous potential to manage complex animations visually, and I worked over the \nsummer to create Svija Vibe.\nIt's all based on linking Adobe Illustrator object names to the GSAP script. Most basic transformations already work well but there's a lot I'll be able to do to make it even simpler to use.\nI'm really excited about it! I've only just started but I have a million ideas about how to make it more capable — the big one being the ability to chain animations together.\nThere's a support document at https://tech.svija.love/how/animation that gives more detail about exactly what can be done.\nSvija Vibe is free. It works with Svija, which is also free, but you do need to create an account to use it (Maconly, at least for the next three months).\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29430368 · previous HN about Svija 2022-12-03\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30454324 · previous HN about animation 2022-02-24\nhttps://greensock.com · GSAP\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33518845\nPoints: 145\n# Comments: 69",

          "description": "I've been looking for some advice or general best practices when it comes to wrangling survey response data that consists mostly of \"click all that apply\" responses and then free text responses (for reference the survey was distributed through Survey Monkey). The data is structured in a wide format, wherein the possible responses for questions are distributed in the columns of the data. For example a question on race would have each of possible values for race as a column variable: \n white <- c(white, NA, NA, white) black <- c(NA, black, NA, black) asian <- c(asian, NA, asian, NA) unique_id <- x(1,2,3) df <- tibble(white, black, asian, unique_id) \n Each respondent's responses are captured in a single row and every respondent has a unique ID, so respondent 1 would have checked the boxes for White and Asian. My question is in regards to how best to go about formatting the data for analysis. Given that there are multiple of these \"check all that apply\" or dummy variable columns, is it best to leave this data in a wide format? Or is it better to gather all of these columns into a single variable and pivot the data longer? My only concern is that there are about 20 questions like this, so pivoting each of these variables would create a really long data frame. Additionally, I need to have the data formatted in a way that would require little to no preprocessing in Tableau. This is primarily due to work policies on formatting research publications and data visuals (I know it's not ideal but I can't change it). \n I have it currently set up in two way: the first is with each question separated out in different excel sheets that can be joined by their unique ID. The second is with all the questions combined into a single data frame. Both are formatted wide. Thanks in advance for any help or advice, I can also provide additional anonymous data if that would help you help me better :)\n    submitted by    /u/Legal_Television_944  \n [link]   [comments]",

One question I ALWAYS get from the business I'm making the models for is, what features are important? How does the model make descicions. So to answer that I do the usual feature analysis, correlation matrices, partial dependence plots, mdi, model extraction. But I still fill like I'm not entirely able to answer what variables are the most important for example.\n Now I was thinking of a new method to determine feature importance. First we need the trained model, and the feature distributions. If we take a feature, we look at the sorted values and take 11 values corresponding to 0% - 10% - .. - 100% of the feature distribution. Next we take for example 1000 random states of the other features and test per random state the 11 options for the selected feature. For this 11 values of the feature, we check the number of times the y-value (label) changes. After doing this for all features, we should have an order of feature importance, as a higer rate of changes indicates more influence on the labels outcome. Would als be applicable for discrete variables and continuous labels with some minor adjustments.\n I love to hear your experiences in this regard and what you think of the proposed method?\n    submitted by    /u/localhoststream  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was wondering what practices people are doing to standardize it and make things more automated and streamlined?\n I've also been trying to make my code more extensible to avoid having to code refactor every time new things comes into play. Since its easy to go in one direction, but harder to go in the other. Keeping things more modular and abstract. I know data science is particularly not fit for some parts of these, since data cleaning is very order based, and EDA is very unplanned and prone to rabbit-holes, but i try to put up with it anyways.\n For example, I no longer do df.groupby(X), but put the key into a list like df.groupby([X]), and maybe take out that and keep it as a list variable for data abstraction. Or do things like df[df[\"col\"].isin([X])] instead of df[df[\"col\"]==X].\n Sure, these create awkward one-element lists at the start, but the point is that they might not end up being one-element anymore in the future. The main con is slower readability with these oxbow lake code. Sometimes my team mate tries to revert and \"de-abstract\" the code back and I have to explain to them why extensibility is good.\n    submitted by    /u/countlinard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a list of several dairy products sold at a grocery store, and data on how many were sold per day over the course of two years. I need to create a data-driven ordering system using this data to model how many of these products the store should order at any given time.\n I'm not used to working with time series, and am rather unsure of how to approach this problem. One model I was thinking could include lag variables for amount sold of this product for the past 7 days. I'm not sure where I could take it from there.\n Appreciate any thoughts from people more expert than me on this on relatively simple methods to solve this problem. This is for a take home assignment for a job interview, and I could use ideas. Links to resources and methods would be very helpful.\n    submitted by    /u/i_am_baldilocks  \n [link]   [comments]",
