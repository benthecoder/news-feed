At 2023-01-30 and after 20 years providing pkgsrc.se and other service they decided it was time to say goodbye.\nRead more details at netbsd.se.\nBecause it’s such an awesome service it was not possible for the NetBSD and pkgsrc community to live without it. So the service will continue from pkgsrc.pub.\nAgain I would like to thank Fredrik and Viktor for all their work providing pkgsrc.se as a real community service over the last 20 years. It’s still a great honour to continue the service in the\nsame name.\nComments",

          "description": "With the proliferation of LLMs like ChatGPT or whatever it is Google is calling their primary LLM these days (LAMDA or otherwise), do people think this will change the market for data scientists? In one world, the market basically stays the same, as more hardcore AI researchers inventing LLMs and cutting edge work remain concentrated in Big Tech. Then more “normal” data science work remains the same elsewhere. In another world, LLMs replace lower level data science work and either decrease demand for data scientists overall or make them less valuable (highly unlikely imoz more likely to free up some lower levels tasks, for example around EDA, than actually replace anyone). In yet another world, the general shift to AI creates hype around the profession and encourages people to invest in data and analytics broadly, even if they’re not doing AI work specifically (whatever AI work actually is). What do people think?

I end up classifying any subject that I can think of in two ways: either too simple to be interesting or too complex to be understandable.

Are there any courses / trainings / bootcamps that provide a good start as well as a (kind of) official certificate?\n Background: I did my bachelors in applied linguistics (statistics was a big part of it, eg linear regression on text corpora to determine readability) and have an MBA. Currently I am working in a Compliance/Risk Management Team and kind of drifted to a data analysis side role. Regularly I write sql code to extract data from our databases and see what we can learn from it. As I had no prior experience, I learned it from scratch by trial and error, asking around and some online tutorials. \n I have of lot of fun doing this (exploring data, writing code) and am looking to steer my career towards that direction more. For starters, I was thinking of doing something official and have some training budget to spend. Hence my question: do you have any tips on trainings that also issue certificates (ideally stuff that means sth). I am typically more of a hands on guy and don’t think doing a 800€ training is better than learning with coursera - but maybe I can have it both?what do you guys think? Is that a good idea? or should I just do a python bootcamp and start from there? I don’t know much about the field in general and have just started gathering information so any related tips are also highly appreciated.

So you cannot really do question answering on a huge knowledge base with these models.\n You can try to fine-tune your own text generation model for that (like GPT-3, GPT-J, etc.) but results are sometimes disappointing as the fine-tuned models tends to forget some of the facts mentioned in the dataset...\n At NLP Cloud, the strategy we prefer is about mixing semantic search and question answering. Here is a quick article about how to do it:\n https://nlpcloud.com/question-answering-on-domain-knowledge-with-semantic-search-and-text-generation.html\n As far as we know, this is the best way to get both a fluent and user friendly answer while being very accurate.\n I would love to hear your thoughts on this.

When I'm trying to extract the areas of the properties, I'm getting a lot of NaN values (~80%). I'm not sure how to deal with them correctly.\n I was thinking about using the mean or median values based on specific property type, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

If you're thinking about using machine learning for your project or business, don't think it's a silver bullet that'll fix all your problems. There are many factors and constraints to consider, like time, costs, and your project's sensitivity. You also need to consider whether you have enough data and whether the patterns in your data are complex enough for machine learning to work. And even if you do have all that stuff, it still might not be the right choice. I wrote a blog post that goes into more detail about these factors and how to decide if machine learning is right for you.

In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on a dataset without labeled outputs. The model must discover patterns and structures independently without any human guidance. Generative AI aims to utilize generative AI models to inspect data and produce new and original content based on that data.\n Generative AI tools use sophisticated algorithms to assess data and derive novel and unique insights, thereby improving decision-making and streamlining operations.

My problem is I have a hand disability so I can’t produce the music I create in any tangible way. I can hum the music in parts but I was wondering…\n Is there an AI music generator where I can hum a melody, tell it what instrument to use, and it will produce that melody in that instrument for me so I can slowly build up my entire song?\n I’ve been able to think in music like this since I was 12 but I could never show anyone.
