Gucci Mane) — https://maroofy.com/songs/1563859943 \nThe Medallion Calls (Pirates of the Caribbean) — https://maroofy.com/songs/1440649752\nHope you like it, and would love to hear any questions/feedback/comments! :D\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34635352\nPoints: 46\n# Comments: 22",

          "description": "(long read)\n Greetings all\n I am an international graduate based in the UK, and recently completed my Master's degree in Bioinformatics and Data Science in Health last autumn. I have recently returned from a trip to my home country and am now seeking employment.\n My programme primarily leads to two paths, either research or working as a data scientist for a health-related company, but neither of these options appeal to me. Throughout my course, I developed a fondness for coding in R and Python and enjoyed solving software-related problems, learning new libraries, reading their documentation, and fixing bugs and so on. I don't have any interest in solving statistics related problems, though.\n I am struggling to determine how to break into a more engineering-focused position without prior job experience. Should I initially apply for analyst roles and work towards transferring to data engineering? I am somewhat pressed for time, as I have only two years left on my graduate visa and am feeling quite confused. Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Harold_the_teeth  \n [link]   [comments]",

For each tweet, one word has been selected as a keyword and each such word is in another column called \"keyword.\" '\n For my purposes, these keywords serve as a label.\n My goal is to create a model to label a Tweet, but I'm having trouble deciding how to encode the label so that I can properly label the Tweets.\n My vocabulary size is 41,886 words, so figure the number of bits for one-hot encoding is 41,886. My training set has 5709 rows and my test set 1904 rows, so 7613 rows in all, so if I try to one-hot encode the keywords, figure roughly 319 million elements in the resulting one-hot encoding array.\n Using word2vec would be problematic, I think, because you can't classify vectors without running the risk of floating-point-related errors.\n What's the most optimal encoding specifically for this purpose?\n    submitted by    /u/Comprehensive-Ad3963  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The traditional route to data science seems to be at least a Masters in Maths > DS > ML etc.\n This is obviously a good start and will hopefully instil good DS foundations - in terms of the theory and tech skills (Python/R etc).\n One key ingredient that is missing is an emphasis on pro-activity. You go through school being told exactly what to do. You go to uni, again being told what to do. And then you get an entry level DS job and they tell you what to do.\n An important skill to develop is being able to asses the tools and materials available to you and come up with something that adds value all on your own. E.g. if you are a data anaylst or DE? well you have access to a shit load of data. Say your company has commercial interests i.e. they want more sales etc. Can you use some advanced analysis to either review customer behaviour or potentially create a model to predict sales?\n    submitted by    /u/bum_dog_timemachine  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I just joined a software company's support operations team as a data scientist. My first project is to improve the current forecasting model predicting future support case volume over the next 12 months to be used as an input for capacity planning.\n The company has multiple software products and the current forecasting models that have been used are all just univariate forecast models that have been only trained on using the historical case volume for each product. These models in general perform pretty well in terms of forecasting accuracy, but the business stakeholders are complaining about how \"un-explainable\" these forecast values are. They want to break down each forecast values into multiple components, but the current model class won't allow them to do so because the these forecasts are only derived from analyzing the past volume's seasonality, holiday effects, and running trends (either increasing or decreasing year over year).\n When I chat with my business stakeholders, they said that the case volume is driven by factors such as active customer count/distribution of customer size across different regions, product maturity measure, case deflection rate (how self-serviceable the company's Knowledge articles and navigations are), and others. We do have these drivers and the stakeholders want to use them and their expectations of the future trends for these drivers in the upcoming forecasts.\n Looks like I can try multivariate models such as VAR, VMA, VARMA, or VARMAX. However, I'm not really sure how reliable they would be. If they won't result in something that will be adopted, then I would prioritize improving the current model's accuracy.\n So my question is, have you also run into the similar problem? Are multivariate forecasts actually even used in Capacity planning? Which model class can I look into?\n    submitted by    /u/welcomestats  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm tend to be too perfectionist (legacy of my uni, where they ask for scientific level documentation pretty much always) \n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/ObligationAntique147  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey reddit,\n I'm a student that is taking part in a contest focusing on banned works of art, and the relationship between art and society. After trying my hand at Chat GPT and DALLE2 I've spurred an idea for the topic of this contest. \n A couple details, the contest is in the form of a comic book page, it's surrounding the themes of obscenity, libel, codes, copyrights, etc. I was considering using AI as the subject matter considering the recent controversies surrounding this new technology. Questions such as whose art is it? The person using the technology, or the person owning it? Is it copyrightable considering it's fed data based on previous artists work? I'm relatively new to this space other than witnessing peoples uses on various social media. \n So given that, my idea was to have Chat GPT generate a fictional story surrounding the relationship of society and art, tweaking until I have something that can be applied into a comic book form, then feeding parameters into DALLE2 to create comic book panels. Given the controversial nature of utilizing AI for school related essays, homework, etc I was curious what this community thinks of this idea? I felt like it was one two punch, utilizing new technology to create artwork that's relevant to the topic at hand and also has the potential to be \"banned\" so to speak from participating in the contest.\n    submitted by    /u/KylesButler  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Artists have always benefited from other people's work. Instead of figuring everything out on your own, you can build on the work of past artists, critics, theorists, etc. to help you figure out techniques, tricks, perspectives. Then there is technological assistance. Digital art is in many ways easier than painting/drawing on a canvas or paper, because it allows you to erase, copy, flip, magnify, etc.\n I think AI could become an even more accessible version of this sort of assistance.\n Imagine if you had complete control over a number of variables when creating an image. You would choose what to depict, the dimensions and position, the lighting, the colours, but you wouldn't need to study human anatomy or architectural styles, or how light casts shadows and refracts in water. The AI could calculate or source these things for you.\n This way AI could allow anyone to create any picture they wanted (as long as they could think of it).\n Do you think this is possible? Would it be very bad for artists? Or would it create new kinds of art and artists? Would you want something like this?\n    submitted by    /u/blindoptimism99  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been testing outputs from GPT-3 davinci003 against alternatives in terms of output quality, relevance, and ability to understand \"instruct\" (versus vanilla autocompletion).\n I tried these: AI21 Jurassic 178B NeoX 20B GPT J 6B FairSeq 13B\n As well as: GPT-3 davinci002 GPT-3 davinci001\n Of course, I didn't expect the smaller models to be on par with GPT-3, but I was surprised at how much better GPT3 davinci 003 performed compared to AI21's 178B model. AI21's Jurassic 178B seems to be comparable to GPT3 davinci 001.\n Does this mean that only well-funded corporations will be able to train general-purpose LLMs? It seems that just having a large model doesn't do much, it's also about several iterations of training and feedback. How are open source alternatives going to be able to compete?\n (I'm not in the ML or CS field, just an amateur who enjoys using these models)\n    submitted by    /u/noellarkin  \n [link]   [comments]",
