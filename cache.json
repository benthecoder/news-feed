          "description": "I’m currently applying for jobs as a data analyst but am having trouble putting together my resume in a way that is catered towards data science. I have a bachelors of science in sport’s administration with a minor in business administration. I’m a few months out from graduating with my masters of business administration with a focus in business analytics. \n My issue is my work experience. I’ve held a lot of odd jobs over the years that I’m not including, like Chick-fil-A, or working as a cart boy. The 3 that I am including are not at all related to data analytics. This is because in undergrad, I loved the idea of working in sports and catered my resume towards that. I’m in sports now and despise it. \n My work experience on my resume consists of a Marketing Graduate Assistant for a university athletic department, a marketing intern for a different universities athletic department, and an administrative intern at a hospital. I’ve been doing a ton of online learning and between that and my MBA, I’ve picked up skills in Python, R, SQL, Tableau, RapidMiner, Excel, MS SQL Server, and Power BI, all of which I’ve included as individual bullet points on my résumé. The majority of my résumé, however, consists of Job descriptions With no relevance to data analytics. \n How do I do my résumé? do I keep the irrelevant job experience or should I minimize the space that takes and expand out my skills to describe how I developed them and what I can do with them?\n    submitted by    /u/jordanar189  \n [link]   [comments]",

Have been around pretty much everywhere as far as software development goes (QA, requirements, a little bit of development, BPM, all the way to project management), but always wanted to get into DS. \n I have taken loads of (good) online courses and have my personal DS projects up in github, but this doesn't seem to grab many recruiters' attention. I'm inclined to think people don't like aspiring DSs that have little to no professional experience. \n So I'd like to hear everyone's opinion: what am I missing? Could it be that I have a far too generalist background, not being particularly expert in any one of those areas? \n Also, I'd be more than happy to settle for a junior DS position as a first gig.
