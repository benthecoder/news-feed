I think it’s one of those technologies that genuinely will change the world, mostly for the better, and it’s super exciting to be in it from the ground up.  I’m going to quit in a few months because hoo it’s a lot of work and I’m a bit burned out… but there’s a 50% chance I’ll come back after a season or two and say “hey, turns out everything else in the world is less cool, want me back?”",

I was acting as a node in a complicated corporate phone tree.\nAnother example, a QA found bugs and verified bugs that would never be prioritized and fixed. Another might be someone who is propping up some bloated code that they could fix, but for Kafkaesque reasons, that’s not the job\nSo have you ever had a bs job? What was it like?",

Metlo works by discovering all your API endpoints, running security tests, and detecting potential attacks. It runs before your APIs go into production, and also in real time, alerting your security team when anomalous usage patterns are detected.  Metlo secures your APIs against the OWASP Top 10 (broken auth, injection, excessive data exposure etc.) and more.\nAlthough APIs are one of the largest attack surfaces in companies today, there aren’t many good security tools to protect them.

          "description": "I have to build a multi class classifier for 3 classes , let's say A,B and C. A is quite dominant in the dataset , 85% of data corresponds to target variable A , 14% for B and ~1% is of C but all these categories are important for me so I want to build a multi class classifier on this highly imbalanced dataset. Any suggestions on how to do that? Or things to keep in mind? Any particular algorithms I could try for this?\n    submitted by    /u/napqueen-9175  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n Sorry if my written English is not correct, I'm not a native speaker. I'm a geochemist and I work with multiple disciplines including hydrogeologists and geostatistical analysts in a multinational engineering firm.\n The problem we've got is that chemical data is always sent in different kinds of (horrible) excel sheets from multiple sources (labs, clients, collages from other departments). We need a system that is able to centralize all chemical data in a database. This needs to be done online and users need to be able to log in and upload data and query data using a web interface. \n We are still in the design process for this and we want to make a prototipe. I am a python user, with a lot of experience processing data using python: pandas, numpy etc..., but I have always worked in CSV and have no experience using SQL or any web platform. I was thinking of doing a simple thing in django or other python web framework, but then I thought, maybe there is some premade tool to do this, for example a django project for this purpose that can be easily modified or just a plugin for wordpress, wix or squarespace or something like that.\n Does anyone has an idea what is the best place to start?\n I'd be very grateful if anyone can share their thoughts or tips about this problem.\n    submitted by    /u/Cahuin  \n [link]   [comments]",
