Odigos is an open-source project that lets you instantly generate distributed traces for your applications. It works alongside existing monitoring tools and does not require any code changes.\nOur earlier experiences with monitoring tools were frustrating. Monitoring a distributed system with multiple microservices, we found ourselves spending way too much time trying to locate the specific microservice that was at the root of a problem. For example, we once spent hours debugging an application which we suspected was causing high latency, only to find out that the actual problem was rooted in a completely different application\nThen we learned about distributed tracing, which solves exactly this problem.…",

I was using basic things in my current job (cleaning, preprocessing, and statistics only) and in the last few months I have been learning from many courses about a variety of algorithms, some basic neural nets, and so on. \n At first, I tried (unsuccessfully) taking notes in Qmarkdown/Obsidian, but the effort and time it took made me comment or document the code better (why I chose that x theorem, conclusions, etc.). \n I tried to \"organize\" this information (I use Python notebooks) but I have multiple ways of saving code depending on the source (GitHub for personal, Colab GDrive for Udemy, Kaggle, etc.). So when I tried to find, for example, X code for X theorem, it is not easy to find because I have the same in multiple files, for example. At that moment, I thought, \"Why am I not taking notes?\" \n Thank you once again (yes maybe too long); I think it is too personal in some point, but I really think what works (or not) for you will help me.\n Regards\n Sebastian\n    submitted by    /u/Sebita82  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm interested in taking a local, human-run workflow and moving it to an automated cloud workflow. I have a seemingly solid grasp of the individual components; it's the design choices and integration (at a high level) that I'm thinking about here. (Also, I see Rule 7, but this seems a bit abstract for what usually works well on SO.)\n I have some code, mostly in notebooks, that pulls data from a few sources (e.g., scraping, APIs), preps it, and writes it out. Then, in other notebooks, I read it in and do some analysis.\n Here's what I'm thinking so far:\n  \nRetrieval: Serverless functions (i.e. Azure Functions). I haven't used it, but it seems straightforward to kick these off on a timer and pass it on.\n Pre-processing: Serverless functions to clean the data for storage, with output inserted into a DB. \n Q: Should this be integrated to the prior step? It's highly-structured data, so it may not need a lot of maintenance on its own.\n Q: If not, should I pass data in here with a queue or some other cloud functionality, or use file storage and a trigger?\n \n Storage: Persistent SQL DBMS as a service.\n Front end: TBD (web interface), but essentially abstracted from the backend, because it queries the general purpose data storage (and makes analytic-specific transformations either within query or after retrieval).\n  \nGeneral questions:\n  \nAre there good resources on the big picture view? Most of my searching has turned up material on the individual components.\n This project (somewhat of a proof of concept) is on the smaller side (1-2GB of data), so are there simplifications that work well at that scale?\n Is there an easy way to have these components deploy from a Github repo? For example, when I push a commit, I'd like the serverless functions to use that newest version.\n  \nHappy for any advice, ideas, and links to things I can read up on.

If they read this, good luck friend! \n ​\n As the title, I am just about to finish my masters and it has been a really rough experience. Academically, I had the chops, but my personal life has had alot of ups and downs the last few years. My wife was very sick, recovered, got sick again, we had a baby in the middle and she almost got sick a third time. It took a toll. \n ​\n I was an English language teacher back in 2018 when I realised that I couldn't see a future in that and so I had better start working on something I thought I not only had an aptitude for but that had potential for an actual career track to pursue. So here I am, battered and bruised but soon to have the certificate in my bloodied hands, 10 KG heavier with a 6 month old baby that has kept me from having a full night's sleep in literally 6 months. \n ​\n The issue is this, I haven't had to job hunt in 10 years, not only that, I last job hunted in person in schools in my city and quickly got a job after meeting the manager of a school. I will have to navigate a whole new world of jobs and interview skills in about 6 weeks. Does anyone have any general advice on where to start this? How could I build a resume with 15 years of teaching experience as my background and a masters? \n ​\n What can I be doing while the likely long job hunt process begins to solidify my skills that were not as well taught as they perhaps could have been? Kaggle competitions? The Odin project? A portfolio of projects of my own? Pratice coding tests for inevitable interview tasks?\n ​\n Any and all advice welcome!

Also track writting, Grammer, interests (internet of things information), about you. Then if you allow it, can go over your medical or financial history, even psychology. It will feel like a chatbot but be a middleman towards seeking healthcare, mental care, and may other things including niché interests and possible career routes. \n I don't propose this to invite any fear or anxiety of a sci-fi narrative, but to objectively observe the trends with AI and my belief where it is going.\n    submitted by    /u/DropDeddBlue  \n [link]   [comments]",
