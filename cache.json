          "description": "Https has been for several years now the dominant protocol on the web, and people have had many years to adopt it. To encourage good security practice, Lobsters should check for a working https connection before allowing a link submission to succeed. For example,\nIf the link is http, not https,\nOr if it is https but a connection attempt to the endpoint fails with a TLS error (e.g. cert expired or secure algorithms not supported),\nIn these cases Lobsters should reject the submission.",

Sounds technical and not sure I'd get accepted. est. ~2 years to complete.\n GT Masters in Analytics, with a few added AI courses. Would likely play catchup on the Micromasters to get that out of the way. est. ~2 years to complete.\n IBM or UT AI Cert and other as needed. 6-9 mos to complete.\n  \nLikely would need a Udemy in Python coding in all 3 cases.

What I want to be able to do is tag a large group of reviews (such as yelp reviews) with one or more appropriately named topics. In the above mentioned tutorials I see the results as clusters that contain common terms, but I don't yet see how to go about adding an appropriate name to these clusters, and then ultimately assigning this name, or tag, back to individual reviews. How do I get from the initial analysis (LDA or what have you), to actually tagging a review with one or more appropriate categories? For example, a review talking about how expensive a hamburger is, might get assigned a \"price\" tag/category. Maybe LDA isn't the right method?

          "description": "I have a problem where I'm looking at API calls and downstream impact. Not really a specific question to answer, but predicting performance of the calls based on path through the audit trail would be interesting to do. Or, anomaly detection (i.e, this API is defective in 10% of transactions) \n I have thought of two approaches. One of them is regarding the data contained within the request/response payloads. The issue is, it's all text based, or changes depending on the specific API, so the data transformation aspect is very tough. Encoding one API's response to compare to a different API's response would be challenging. Perhaps there is an opportunity for deep learning here. \n The other approach I'm thinking about, is treating this as a graph problem. The majority of these transactions will form a tree-like structure, but some of them don't have a true root, so its more of a directed, acyclic graph (think it's called a polytree?). My approach would be to use graph theory principals such as degrees, closeness, vertex distance, etc. as features instead of parsing the very dynamic payloads. Since these are rules-based systems, I would love to be able to model the underlying relationships between these calls, that way when one transaction chain doesn't match the model, it's likely an anomaly. \n Does this make sense to do? Has anyone here done something similar? Any recommended literature? I've tried googling it, but when you search \"machine learning approach to tree-based systems\", you get a lot of papers or articles referencing tree-based ML models, which is not exactly what I'm looking for yet.

Google maps might make it more helpful for searches related to geographical regions.
