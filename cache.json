It is the official journal of ISKO (International Society for Knowledge Organization), which is a professional association for scholars of knowledge organization, knowledge structures, classification and organization studies and information and data structure. These are some of the themes of the scientific articles published in the journal in general, as well as some other themes such as thesauri, ontologies and studies of terminologies in the flow and organization of scientific data and information.\n That's why I invite you to follow our social networks and take a look at the scientific works that we publish on them weekly. (: \n Here are the official links of the journal to learn more about it:\n https://www.isko.org/ko.html\n https://www.nomos-elibrary.de/zeitschrift/0943-7444\n And the links to our networks are these:\n Twitter: https://twitter.com/ko_isko_/\n Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ko.isko/\n Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/KnowledgeOrganizationISKO\n I hope you guys find cool and useful work for your studies!\n https://preview.redd.it/xzhn0uayhx2a1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=96b847f642e9ec680cd66a49258d1787bde37893\n    submitted by    /u/badmatt2305  \n [link]   [comments]",

The function doesn’t iterate through d but it tests for stationarity and proceeds accordingly.\n The model results, for the most part, look good.

          "description": "They want to track the speed of a long process across its different stages. Currently they are using Average number of days for completion of all cases as a metric. Naturally there are a few uncontrollable outliers which take too long to complete, which affects the overall average. \n I suggested we use Median/Percentiles instead of average, but few people seem to disagree. Their reasoning is that Median is less sensitive to individual cases. For example, if the current Median is 50, and if we manage to improve speed for cases which take 1-49, Median won't be able to track this improvement. Similarly, if we manage to reduce the speed of cases taking more than 50 days to a number which is above 50, Median won't be affected. I believe this line of reasoning is somewhat unjustified for avoiding using Median.\n Their proposed solution is to compute Average after exclude 5-10% of the longest cases. They will decide what % of cases to exclude (threshold) after seeing what the numbers look like under different thresholds. To me it seems they are just abusing the data to suit their agenda.\n Even one of the higher-ups wants to implement this solution.
