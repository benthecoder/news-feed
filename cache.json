          "description": "I remember years ago I spent sometime to learn it as I was curious how a purely functional front-end language feels like, and genuinely thought it had a good chance of being massively adapted in the near future, especially with what seemed like a vibrant community.\nHowever, I got distracted by a data science career and toolchain. Am in the process of starting my first SaaS as a solo founder and was looking at what languages to use and was surprised to see that Elm...seems dead? As an example I did a search on hackernews and it hardly got mentioned in the last year (both comments and posts!)\nAm wondering if anyone can provide some more light on what happened to the language? Is it a safe bet? And what is a suitable good replacement for it?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34746161\nPoints: 154\n# Comments: 139",

          "description": "Medium.com is still up and running so it hasn't failed exactly, but it's not the best platform to go to anymore when it comes to blogging.\nThe post quality has deteriorated, and it feels like I'm reading the same posts over and over again. Not to mention the stupid paywall which is infuriating.\nWhy did Medium end up like this? In the beginning it was pretty good but then it started to wither. Is there any way for a platform like Medium to keep up with high quality posts while also paying their writers well?\nSubstack has done a good job at competing in the blogging market but it's different from Medium. Medium is more of a social blogging platform while Substack is more of a newsletter platform. Substack doesn't have an algorithm that recommends you content, but instead shows you exactly who you follow. This is nice, but I can't deny that I also like finding new content through a recommendation engine, which Medium also sucks at.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34743772\nPoints: 182\n# Comments: 253",

I need to add everything into one workbook so that me and my boss can analyse the data.\n The data however is a bit messy. The first two rows contain headers that I need, but the second header needs to be turned into columns to measure the hours spend on something per name. There is also data under the screenshot that is not needed, but that data is in different rows every sheet.\n There are no tables in the sheets, only some visible formatting but no data formatting.\n The screenshot is one example of a sheet from the workbooks i need to analyse. Every sheet contain about 100 rows and 30 columns, but the amount of rows is different for each sheet.\n I've tried analysing with Power Query, then python and started to think about SQL when I couldn't figure it out.\n I'm a bit stuck about making the decision which language to use. If some of you could point me in the right direction I can continue and be on my way.

          "description": "Greetings everyone.\n I work on a company that builds software solutions for governments. At the data sector, we are processing healthcare data for BI and ML applications. \n Our current data pipeline looks something like this: Oracle db (data source) -> PostgreSQL db (intermediate db) -> Power BI. This workflow is orchestrated by AirFlow.\n The main issue we are facing is the control of which person can access which database, and the segmentation of said data.\n We would also like to implement a data governance tool. I have been looking into Delta Lake, but it seems this is a tool for data lake house, and not data governance.\n I would like advice on which tools should I look into that can fix the issues mentioned. Also, given our current situation, what would be the next step in order to implement a data governance tool?\n Thanks in advance!!\n Edit: forgot to mention, but this tool also needs to be able to work both on premise and in the cloud.\n    submitted by    /u/Alvin0p1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I saw the job posting in linked in yesterday and to my surprise one of the requirements is experience with ML! \n I’ve been with my current company for 7 months and it’s not bad but not great either. Boss is hands off, invests in courses and training. But I’m the sole DS in my team and don’t have a mentor. There are other DS in the in different departments, but due to some workplace politics we compete more than we collaborate. \n So to keep this post short, I see two options: \n A. Get a year under my belt with my current company and work on personal projects that will help a future application with Company B. \n B. Call the recruiter back and say I’ve changed my mind after reading the JD and potentially move. \n I’ve had awkward gaps and lengths in my CV in the past hence my reluctance to leave so early. But since my foots in the door with my ideal company I’m not sure what to do. \n Any advice or suggestions?\n TIA\n    submitted by    /u/mrcat6  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Functional Data Analysis is an emerging branch of statistics, it is in response to the growing advancement in data collection in wearable devices or other data measured over time. the study of high dimensional data,in which the instead of the observations being data points, each observation represents a function in time, wear features can be extracted from smooth functions (derivatives are used as features a lot) or other functional “variants” of classical statistical models ie. (Functional linear model, functional PCA, etc.). The use of functions can be generalized to other types of data, such as imaging, where they estimate higher dimensional surfaces. \n My question is are there any data scientists out there who do functional data analysis?

It can perfectly navigate through even the toughest terrain and is able to best the best of the best PVPers (weird way to write it I know XD)\n This AI was trained in three sections.

          "description": "I was experimenting with ChatGPT the other day. I found it impressive but still make subtle mistakes especially in more technical fields. It could definitely trick a layperson, but to an expert it's at times just a bunch of words meshed together that don't make sense. (Interestingly, it is also completely useless when describing video game walkthroughs, like how to find a certain item or access a certain area in a game, which should be very straightforward and unambiguous information.)\n Now let's say AI has a 95% accuracy. Since AI generated content is much easier to produce, there will only be more and more AI generated content on the internet. And since AI is trained from the information on the internet, eventually there will come a point where AI is learning mostly from other AI-generated content. One can imagine that now the AI will only have a 95%*95% accuracy, and so on and so forth.\n Eventually I imagine the accuracy of the information on the internet should deteriorate to a point where an AI like chatgpt is no longer trustworthy (at least in non-academic fields), as well as those AI-generated websites that you already see a lot on the internet.\n Possible/likely? Is there an academic name to this possibility?\n    submitted by    /u/profmarylowe  \n [link]   [comments]",
