Help each other, ask questions, brainstorm, etc. There is just so much benefit to joining a community when you are in this field, especially when you cannot find the question you are looking for on stack overflow! 😉\n This is the same thing with AI, which is why I created a Discord server two years ago. Where anyone learning or working in the field could come and share their projects, learn together, work together, and much more. The community is now close to 30'000 members, which is unbelievable!\n Likewise, if you are just tinkering with ChatGPT, DALLE or MidJourney. Come join us and share your creations and the projects/companies/products you build (or find your next co-founder)!\n So glad to see it growing and see everyone so active. We have partnered with Towards AI to provide qualitative events, live streams, a community newsletter, free courses following recent developments, job opportunities, and more!\n p.s. we are always looking for contributors to our different projects (answer questions, moderation, help with open-source resources, podcast hosts...). Please reach out to me if interested!
