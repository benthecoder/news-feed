This company mainly deals with providing AI/ML solutions to various businesses such as sabic wendys and other such organisation.\n But everything is good and all. But the thing is they will be making me undertake masters degree in datascience from University of Arizona, in order to be make bound to them for a longer period of time. The course would be online from where i work i need not to go usa in order to pursue the degree... \n This feel like a golden chance to me.. and feels like too good to be true.. moreover they will be paying me a salary while providing all of this with compulsory year wise increments based of performance.. only downside is that they will repay the loan amount taken for the higher studies in 4-5 years. I can leave the company if i get a good offer but i need to pay the remaining loan amount which they said wont be very high. \n So let me know if this would be good for me... And also will taking up a distance course from University of Arizona would be good for my career as they said the certification will hold the same value as a full time course from the University.\n    submitted by    /u/nice_view_4u  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is a completely new industry, subfunction and change of pace. I was previously working in credit and now I work in marketing.\n I'm leading an entire workstream and the problem is there is a lot of understand and keep up. Two months in I am feeling completely lost. I'm pulled into countless meetings throughout the day with no clarity on what is being discussed. This is a new workstream so my manager knows nothing and is not of much help as well. I'm learning by asking questions to my stakeholders but honestly at this point I feel like I'm eating an elephant. There's a lot to keep up and I don't where to start.\n I constantly feel like I'm not doing enough and it's just a matter of time before I'm fired. (I want to add so far I have received good feedback from my stakeholders/manager but it's small simple analysis I did. I think I don't understand the big picture or things on a broader level yet) Is this normal in tech?

We used one app last year for the process, but it was still an absolute clusterf***. I'm looking at possibly creating a Power App from Microsoft as a way to create a central repo for people to take pictures of all the barcodes and then I run them through a reader/software on my end (eliminates user error).\n Regardless, would anyone have a good rec for an app that can read barcodes/give something like vendor information or possibly UPC info for retail items, etc?\n    submitted by    /u/WhatsTheAnswerDude  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I've been a data scientist for around 2 years now in an industry that's being hit hard by the current economy and will likely get worse over time. Talk around the office makes it pretty clear we should expect layoffs in tech. I'm not near the top of the headsman's list, but it's a possibility.\n I've received an offer for a 2-year contract (W2 through a staffing firm) working for a large company with good name recognition. It's a big pay bump even after accounting for the extra cost of buying into benefits, and this company is in an industry that will likely weather a recession very well. The only catch is that they apparently never convert to full time.\n Has anyone had experience with this kind of long term contract work in DS? How were you treated? How did it affect your career prospects long term? Were you able to get back into regular direct hire work after?\n    submitted by    /u/tangentc  \n [link]   [comments]",

I spend time looking for the *right* window or the *right* cell in a jupyter notebook, and it's frustrating.\n 3) I'm going to switch to an IDE just to reduce all the window clutter, and make work cleaner and leaner, but I'm not sure how to start. A lot of videos are only 9-10 minutes long, and I've got an entire holiday weekend to prep for next sprint.\n Right now I've installed VSCode but I'm open to other options. Really what I'm looking for is long-format material that talks about how to use an IDE, how to organize projects within an IDE, and how to implement the features I need like Python, Anaconda, and AWS access. \n If you know of any, please send them my way.\n    submitted by    /u/AresBou  \n [link]   [comments]",

In software there's the concept of \"Design Patterns\"; can be done something similar for implementing feature stores?\n Example: daily raw data but models you have in production mostly use monthly aggregated features (i.e. monthly totals, weekly totals, weekend totals, workday totals, ...). Do you compute and store all those features or try to find only 'elemental' features and let the model compute the rest? For example workday totals can be obtained by difference among monthly totals and weeekend totals, last month total can be obtained by querying the previous month monthly total instead of having the same feature replicated in the observation month, etc.\n What suggestions do you have?

          "description": "AI News Anchors will soon be commonplace on news networks.\n  \nProduce the fastest breaking news in the world.\n  \nIn the event of an emergency, such as severe weather, an AI Anchor can quickly deliver new video and release breaking news content faster than traditional broadcasters\n With AI Avatar, the script immediately becomes a news video, saving at least 10 to 20 minutes in breaking news time.\n  \nReduce cost when producing news videos.\n  \nNews can break anytime, so a news anchor must always be available, and the production crew needs to be ready at a moment’s notice. The broadcasting station must hire hiring more announcers, crew, and staff to support the 24-hour news cycle. However, if there is an AI Avatar, there is no need for the anchor and film crew.\n  \nNever make a mistake in delivering a message.\n  \nAnchors are people, too. Even if you are a well-trained and experienced Anchor, you may stumble at pronunciation or show surprise in unexpected situations. AI Avatar always delivers news with the correct pronunciation and the appropriate tone.\n *AI Avatar Tongue Twister Video\n    submitted by    /u/Newface_ai  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think about this more and more, in our compulsively visual culture, which increasingly reduces what we think and feel and see -- who and what we are -- to what can be photographed. I think of Susan Sontag, who called it \"aesthetic consumerism\" half a century before Instagram.
