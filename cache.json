          "description": "So ever since becoming a data scientist, I've been constantly getting flooded with connect requests on Linkedin. I'd say about half of them are established people in the field, (DS/DA/DE), and the other half are people trying to get into the field. Additionally, I get about 4-6 new requests every week from people asking to connect with me, either asking for a job referral, to talk about my role, or advice on how to break into data science. So I usually meet about 2-4 of people a week to give them advice how to get into the field since a lot of people I've talked to think my career pivot is inspiring. I had close to 100 LinkedIn connections this time last year and now I'm over 600 and climbing.\n ​\n I wanted to ask is getting this many requests normal for other data scientists (roughly 6-12 per week)? And if so, how do you guys deal with all the other people asking for help all the time (if you choose too, since I've realized it can become time-consuming)? My manager says he gets requests for help all the time too and it's because of the field we are in, so I was curious if most other data scientists experience this? I've talked to other successful people with great jobs, and although they did get a lot of requests for help, especially earlier on in their careers, some did mention that the amount I get weekly is pretty high. I also wonder if it just happens to be due to the job market as of late?\n    submitted by    /u/FellowZellow  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n We are working on a UE AI project for a SP FPS game. The core concept of the game is around fighting the AI in a realistic, but fun way. It will have a deep perception system and a fairly large combat and non combat behavior tree.\n We have made some good progress with the combat AI when it is outdoors. It is far from finetuned, but it works, and it is actually fun and challenging. The next step to tackle is indoors. Close combat simulation, searching for target, etc. I really would like it to be dynamic and not tied to hard coded environmental triggers but the small team of mine is pushing for that. Clearly that is the easier approach and I could not come up with some good ideas so here I am to ask the community.\n So my question is: Any existing dynamic AI implementation out there for recognizing a corner, a door, objects the enemy can hide behind without actually designating map elements as such? Any info would be appreciated!\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Huncowboy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Chat gpt is big right now and AI has been an increasingly mainstream topic, but I'd like to think about the difference between the current 'AI' and a true 'artificial intelligence'.\n When I think of a true artificial intelligence, I think of an entity that has its own will and desires. An entity that can produce its own internal thought process and maintain a stream of consciousness. This does not currently occur with chat gpt and similar programs and it's not their goal.\n Chat gpt (from what I understand) runs off a training inventory, an algorithm to decipher that inventory and produce acceptable outputs based on input given. It can use language, but that language is nothing more than statistics. 'What, given the available resources, is the logical output.' It's a series of if-then statements.\n I've used writing AI programs, and have created dialogues, but I know that none of them will ever have true independence thought, as it's not in their programming. They are reactive, not proactive programs.\n What are your thoughts on these different types of AI? Do you know of any programs working towards a simulated consciousness?\n    submitted by    /u/ArmoredRogue  \n [link]   [comments]",
