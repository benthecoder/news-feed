I don’t think we even had shell scripts. We just had batch files so you could run things, a compiler, and Fortran. And assembler possibly, if you really needed it. So there wasn’t this agony of choice. Being a young programmer today must be awful—you can choose 20 different programming languages, dozens of framework and operating systems and you’re paralyzed by choice. There was no paralysis of choice then. You just start doing it because the decision as to which language and things is just made—there’s no thinking about what you should do, you just go and do it.\nFor context this book is copyrighted 2009 so this interview is more than a decade old, and I'm sure many things have changed since then.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33056052\nPoints: 140\n# Comments: 197",

For some background, I do have B.S. degree in Mathematical Statistics but have only been in education. \n From that degree, I have experience in Java and C++ programming along with several statistics courses and other higher level math courses. Should I do a bootcamp to get the skills needed to get into this field? (I’m more worried about not knowing things like R, Tableau, SQL, Python, or Power BI.) I’d like to know what I’d need to master before I can start advertising myself as a DS on Linked In. \n Also, how do I make myself appealing to potential employers? I feel as if being in education sometimes downgrades one’s value to several organizations since educators (in the US at least) have lost respect and aren’t seen as valuable much anymore. \n If anyone here is in charge of hiring other DS candidates, what exactly are you looking for on a resume?\n    submitted by    /u/awesomearugula  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have a lot of 3rd party csv files that need to be manipulated, merged and formed into reports.\n My colleagues are tech illiterate. So installing python on their laptops and letting them run scripts is too complex. Writing a UI in python and letting them run self coded .exe files is prevented by IT department of the holding our startup is connected to. \n So I'm searching for a soulution that has a) great data manipulation capability and b) is capable of building nice UI capabilities\n ​\n A typical task looks like this:\n  \nDownload one or more .csv files from a 3rd party tool\n Data Cleanup\n Match the data to entries in our database\n Create various pivot tables\n Loop through the user database and create PDF reports for each user\n  \n​\n I tried building most tools in excel, but boy do I hate this program. I mean... for easy data manipulation and visualisation it's fine, but there's a lot of issues when you start writing a lot of UI\n I thought about PowerBI - does anyone have experience with it?

I’m looking to bring my stats knowledge up to par to understand texts like Deep Learning- Goodfellow, PRML, ML A Probabilistic Perspective, etc. \n My background is civil engineering and in undergrad took Calc 1-3, Diff Eq, Linear Algebra and a non-calc based stats 101 type class. When I got my masters in Civil-Transportation I took some stats modeling classes that covered regression (linear, logistic, poisson, negative binomial, etc) pretty heavily using R+NLOGIT.\n At this point my stats knowledge is pretty disjointed and feel like I dont have a solid understanding of the fundamentals. From what I can tell with some research the most popular recommendations I've seen are:\n  \nStatistical Inference- at first glance this book feels way above my level, like I can probably work out some things with effort, but I'll probably need another book to fill in the gaps.\n All of Statistics- Looks solid as a reference for someone who's taken way more stats than I have, super concise but super dry read.\n Mathematical Statistics with Applications(Wackerly)- This is one that feels like could be a possibility\n Introduction to Probability(Blitz)- This feels like the other contender\n  \nSo far books 3 and 4 seem like best options, is there anything else I'm missing or votes one way or another?\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/425trafficeng  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’ve recently become very interested in the history of AI, and I’ve been reading a few articles as well as the book “A Brief History of AI” by Michael Woolridge for a good primer on the subject. I’ve decided to collect some of my thoughts in a very short essay.\n First, I want to discuss the term “AI” itself. In some sense it feels like a marketing term. It’s a very loaded term, and any time it is used, there is almost always a more precise designation that could be used (machine learning, heuristic search, etc.). Of course any of these more precise terms could further be broken down with even more precision, but I think that when we group so many applications under the umbrella of “AI”, invalid associations are made. For example, if fears about slaughterbots create a negative bias towards …",

I love scifi and stuff as well it all got me thinking about where this is headed and I wanted to know how long it may realistically take till we get there. I could see a world where you could feed a neural network all the episodes of Seinfeld and it could give you an infinite number of new episodes, all rendered in photo realistic detail. Could be any show, King of Queens, Everybody Loves Raymond, Family Guy, Community. \n You could also have an ai write and generate shows based on current trends with no input from human beings. All the voice work and acting would he generated. Then the show could morph and change in real time based on reception and feedback. \n So how long until those things are realistically possible, or at least close?
