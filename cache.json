The thing is the job is a 6 month contract and while they have a very strong history of hiring contact employees, in the interview i asked what the odds were of me being hired and he said he couldn’t have a solid answer and that the budget is decided in the new year and it was out of his hands. He made it clear that he was very interested in having me become a full time employee. \n Another thing he mentioned that kind of through me off was he was suprised about the fact that i had a full time job and wasn’t currently doing contract work. He then said “i shouldn’t really be saying this but as a friend i would be hesitant about leaving a full time job for a contract esp bc he cannot gaurentee me full time and that with the way the economy is going it could be risky”\n Would love if anyone would like to weigh in. I like my job now but this raise would be great and the company is a fairly big one that i would love to be at. I’m fairly early in my career with only 2+ years of experience.

They were really impressed with me but couldnt offer me full time job as the startup is underfunded but offered me 2 months testing internship (3 days/wk ,payed hourly) and then the option to sign full time job after.\n In general the past week was my first week. I REALLY like the job, the data, the location, the people, basically everything. \n My only problem is I have a bit of imposter syndrome. Until now I only did Kaggle notebooks and the rapid change to production enviornment stresses me out a bit. I get lost in masses of codes and directories. Also the data is much bigger than what I used to deal with. My internship is basically improving one of their models. The past week I spent most of it trying to figure out the code and also did a lot of my version of feature engineering but they want next week to apply it to production already and its kinda stressing me out a bit that Im slow and wasting their time (I wouldnt have had problem if it was a big coorporation, but its a fairly early small underfunded startup as said so every dollar counts and I do want to give value for the money they spent on me even if they dont continue with me).\n I wanted to ask you guys if you have any tips on how to succeed in this internship and how to make the shift from kaggle-notebooks code to production enviornment? I know I can do this I just need to get a grip of myself asap.\n Highly appreciate your help!\n    submitted by    /u/nuriel8833  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have only three technical people in the company including me, and the CEO expects me to handle the front end, and GUI for the websites and the projects just because I have one year of experience as a developer on top of all the workload with no extra compensation. \n At the time of employment, it was mentioned I will be working on the research project I was assigned along with submitting abstracts for conferences and publishing papers (just for this project). But now I'm working on three different AI-based cancer research projects and it's very hard for me since I come from a compSc background and had to do a lot of ground research. Although initially, I thought medical research is cool, I don't see myself on the medical side in a long run, and due to overworking, I'm losing my interest in research as well. \n They tried to tie me up by continuously pressuring me into doing a Ph.D. sponsored by them in QMUL. But I successfully denied it, because I know if I agree I'm struck here for the next 4-5 years and also I feel I'm quite inexperienced to do a Ph.D. before actually going out and exploring different fields and opportunities.\n For context, I'm 23 with BTech in Information Technology and MSc in Data Science (from Uof Glasgow) and have one year of experience as an App developer along with working in this company for six months now, my contract here ends March 2023. \n I'm still very passionate about DS, but I decided I will leave this job after the contract, when do you think I need to start applying for new jobs since the competition is high (note: I still have one yr of PSW visa left but after that I need sponsorship)?

          "description": "Say I’m doing some EDA on Our mobile customers for the past 12 months of sales data. Is there a way I can take into account the average customers increase\\decrease when “grading” how the customer did? Essentially, it’s similar to how a time series model takes seasonality into account. This is data I may want to use in a model at some point. \n So if customer 1 sees a decrease Of 2% this month, but the average customer decreased 5% then customer 1 performed pretty well.\n Conversely, if Customer 1 sales increased 5%, but the average increase for all customers was 10%, then he/she didn’t perform very well.\n Essentially, a customers increase/decrease is relative to how over sales were and I’d like a way to indicate that. Is there a mathematical equation in could perform? Any other suggestions? Or is it something I shouldn’t worry about.\n    submitted by    /u/Ok-Resort-4196  \n [link]   [comments]",

Are my fears valid? \n I am heavily pursuing data science. I plan to start a masters degree in January, I am enrolled in an MIT program until then and I am putting an extra 20 hours of personal learning on top of my fulltime job to get the skills required for this career. I am not choosing DS because it sounds sexy or it pays well (those are nice though) but I am truly interested in the field (Especially medical AI and ML to predict side effects or treatment response) I am afraid however that there is too many applicants out there and very few entry level jobs. \n What are the odds?

This is where I learned very important soft skills that made me a way better data scientist.\n Note: clients in this case can be anyone that gives you an assignment. For example, your manager, an external client, your colleague, etc.\n 10 tips:\n  \n Be helpful, don’t be obedient. Help your client in the best way possible, but set boundaries on what you will do. Some people see us as these magical creatures that can do everything. Protect yourself from that.\n  Small talk is not a waste of time; it is a social lubricant that increases the client’s confidence in you.\n  Adjust your message to the audience. Check who they are and what is important to them. Also, make sure you use the right terminology (e.g. do not use technical terms when talking to non-technical business people).\n  A good presentation is like a good conversation. Make your point, but also leave room for questions.\n  If you do not know the client beforehand, start with an introduction. Who are you? What is your background? What are your hobbies?\n  Nobody likes surprises. If something unexpected comes up, discuss this with your client as soon as possible.\n  Make the client feel that the solution was his or her idea. Explain all the available options and guide the client to the preferred solution. This depends on what you're working on of course. For example, if you are not sure what data to include, try to involve your client and come up with an answer together.\n  The client is not your friend. Be friendly, but watch what you say about your private life.\n  The more senior your audience is, the more to the point you need to be.\n Being professional is not about removing emotion. It is OK to smile :).\n  \n​\n I hope you found this useful and good luck with your projects!\n P.S.

But no single scientist is aware of all of these findings, because the amount of information is just too big.
