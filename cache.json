You will determine the requirements of your software by discussing it with the instructor after you have declared your project topic. The basic requirements are to use python language, json or csv type data storage and graphical user interface.

Maybe, we should include Gradient Boosting and Random Forest to the list, but they are not very challenging as well.\n  \nOut of 188 comments thus far there are: \n - 41 mentions of regression \n - 21 of logistic \n - 6 of t-test \n - 5 of hypothesis testing \n - 2 of ANOVA \n - 4 of Bayesian\n  \nHence, I become curious about what people's most proud contributions to their team or company.\n Note: I am aware that using more complex techniques does not necessarily imply producing more fruitful results. However, the techniques mentioned above are still far away from people's expectations regarding being a data scientist. Thus, I am still curious about the most significant contributions, and how much people satisfied with them.\n Edit: Mine was proposing a new solution to a highly complex classification problem. Proved that the proposed method has higher accuracy using bootstrap and t-test. Designed a production-level architecture to implement the new solution. Introduced the bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Accuracy rose from 70ish percent to 95+.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Miriel18  \n [link]   [comments]",
