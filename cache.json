Think, Family Doctor's Office, Local Cafe, Small barber, etc.\nI will be developing a blog for SEO purposes and doing other things to promote my business online. However, I believe the key to success here will be \"Cold Sales\". I have never done that before. So, if you could recommend a book, a blog post, other online resources, or you just have a random advice that I could learn from, I would be very thankful.\nSuffice it to say I will be starting out ASAP, even though I don't know anything. I believe practice is the best teacher. However, if there are any resources that could help me get up and running quicker that would be awesome.

          "description": "Hi there - I am doing some research for a school project, I am talking about and demonstrating how diffrent models work. I am at the point that if I train a model off of a dataset, it will only be as good as the dataset and will be immideatly the same level as the dataset. What I want to achieve is to create an agent, it makes moves off of random bias, then depending on the game outcome, change the bias (a generational AI). I have done some searching online and virtually no one has done this approche before. I idealy want to show both models competing against each other at the same level and show that both agents have a learning curve. I know how to setup the game to play off of a dataset, but I dont know how to approch my idea. How can I setup agents that are initially random bias, and only do a move that is within a pre make list of possible moves. Any ideas where to start/how to approch my idea?\n    submitted by    /u/Thomassey476  \n [link]   [comments]",
