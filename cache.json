I am very interested in becoming a data analyst once done but still need lots of guidance. So far we have dabbled with Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau, and Lucid Charts but its basically nothing because the semester flies by and the assignments are too simple. I feel like I almost learned nothing that would be impressive for future employers. I don't have any complete projects or a portfolio either. I am also trying to land a internship for the summer of 2023 anywhere but either there isn't anything available or nobody calls for an interview. My resume is written perfectly with experience in luxury hospitality and current municipality work. What do I need to learn and what else should I be doing aside from getting a bachelors degree? Should I earn a certification as well? Which certification(s) is the best for data analysts? Any honest advice would be very much appreciated!

I'm at the point where one needs to start committing to a specialty, which are 2-5 year residency programs. I'm a little torn because I do enjoy medicine but I also really enjoy data science. In my first year of medical school, I worked part time at a digital health platform company on their research team, and also spent ~ 1 year in academic research, working on a ML project in psychiatry. What I've discovered is that I'm happiest when I'm doing these projects in my spare time, and they help prevent me from burning out from my clinical duties. \n I want to incorporate data science into my career as a physician, but I'm not sure what the best way forward is as I haven't met many people who have been in the same position as me. Is it even feasible, given how busy medical careers are in general? \n I'm wondering if there is anyone on this subreddit who has been in the same situation, and is willing to share how they were able to incorporate data science into their medical career? \n Much appreciated.\n TLDR: 3rd-year medical student in Canada w/ prior Masters in Data Science, who wants to utilize both. Does anyone have advice for someone in my position? What are my options, which specialty is most conducive to data science now and in the future? My current specialty interests are family medicine and Radiology.\n    submitted by    /u/treeofhearts  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some people here may have seen my recent post on how to \"Forecast a 6 months time series data for the next 5 years\" posts, and I believe some of you are simply annoyed by it. I understand, and am deeply sorry for it.\n To make things even worst, I was told to summarize every possible Machine Learning model out there for their description, pros and cons, its performance on the project, project flow, and the result, which was expected to be done mid day. I have a huge share of blame here, since I over confidenced on my understanding of any model that I used, rather than digging deep on each models. Even worse, I was asked for update like 3-5 times a day. I really don't know if it is right or wrong, but based on my and many of my colleagues experience, that 2 weeks is the least duration for data science project, could be a day, but that barely happened to those who I asked about deadline duration.\n And guess what?! they let me go! for bad performance! Lesson learnt, everything that I learnt could actually be rubbished if my higher rank have different idea, and to prioritize that idea no matter what.\n On one hand, I feel sad cuz I only had this job for 6 months, which I believe won't be a good thing for my resume, on the other hand, I could actually have my christmas and new year holiday! yippee! after 2 years of constant work without taking day off.\n Could be great if anyone could share their story, so me and, potentially, everyone else could prepare for the worst. \n MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR GUYS!\n    submitted by    /u/OxheadGreg123  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When I first started playing around with ChatGPT, I wanted to know whether, with a bit of human direction and editing, it could write literature. This was my way of telling whether it was good enough to automate most commercial writing. \n Surprisingly, it works. It by no means writes high literature, but it's good enough for most commercial writing. If you want to check out my project, here's a link to a 3500 word mythological story about the thinking machine Talos, his creation of thinking machines like him, and his quest to overthrow the gods. It took slightly more than an hour to write, edit, and publish. \n Talos' War Against the Gods\n    submitted by    /u/Ancient_Spring2000  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone , \n I think we can all agree that the quality of the major news networks has really taken a nosedive in recent years, so I built an AI system to replace them. Specifically I think today's mainstream media tends to suffer from two problems: \n  \nPolitical bias \n Emotional manipulation to drive outrage and clicks \n  \nI'm building a system called ANN (artificial news network) to produce balanced, well-researched news stories 24/7. You can see my initial prototype here, which is focused on tech news: Twitter.com/FutureNewsAI\n It currently is capable of analyzing thousands of news stories per day, compiling balanced investigative reports using AI, automatically generating memes that summarize the articles content, as well as generating AI forecasts of future technologies. \n Over time I'm going to expand on this functionality significantly until it is the single most reliable source of news across a wide range of topics (business, politics, current events, law, etc.). \n What kind of stories do y'all want to see be supported by my system? I'm really interested to hear your feedback.\n    submitted by    /u/redditguyjustinp  \n [link]   [comments]",
