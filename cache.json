This has made connecting to VPNs with servers outside Iran, and Tor close to impossible. That being said, the servers inside Iranian data centers still have access to the outside world.\nThe government has also blocked Instagram and WhatsApp (the main channels of communication used by people inside Iran), and alternatives such as Telegram, Signal, etc are also blocked, halting communications to a crawl.

I was wondering if there were any neat methods to perform a more large-scale and interaction-based analysis of the brain response. For example, I have many areas that respond to stimulation and at first, I used to make a scatterplot showing the response ratio of one area to another, but I want to expand this to many others to find a possible trend or interaction effect between areas. For example, some show horrible response in one area, but response in another is good. (I get confused if I should exclude this sample or if some interaction effect is occuring). The ideal goal would be to predict all other area's responses based on one or two area's response. I hope this makes sense and would appreciate data scientist's expertise.

I would like to start working in the data scientist field, but all jobs ask for experience, and I am not searching for a Jr position because the pay is too low (and there are not many vacancies). For now, I keep working as a software developer, but I would like to do some projects to start getting experience and someday apply for another role. From my interviews, I realize companies do not care about academic background, so I wouldn't consider Kaggle or work with educational datasets.\n What do you recommend to me? Is there any kind of open projects to work with? I was searching for some volunteering opportunities without much success.\n    submitted by    /u/alandragonrojo  \n [link]   [comments]",

He made it clear that he was very interested in having me become a full time employee. \n Another thing he mentioned that kind of through me off was he was suprised about the fact that i had a full time job and wasn’t currently doing contract work. He then said “i shouldn’t really be saying this but as a friend i would be hesitant about leaving a full time job for a contract esp bc he cannot gaurentee me full time and that with the way the economy is going it could be risky”\n Would love if anyone would like to weigh in. I like my job now but this raise would be great and the company is a fairly big one that i would love to be at. I’m fairly early in my career with only 2+ years of experience.

They were really impressed with me but couldnt offer me full time job as the startup is underfunded but offered me 2 months testing internship (3 days/wk ,payed hourly) and then the option to sign full time job after.\n In general the past week was my first week. I REALLY like the job, the data, the location, the people, basically everything. \n My only problem is I have a bit of imposter syndrome. Until now I only did Kaggle notebooks and the rapid change to production enviornment stresses me out a bit. I get lost in masses of codes and directories. Also the data is much bigger than what I used to deal with. My internship is basically improving one of their models. The past week I spent most of it trying to figure out the code and also did a lot of my version of feature engineering but they want next week to apply it to production already and its kinda stressing me out a bit that Im slow and wasting their time (I wouldnt have had problem if it was a big coorporation, but its a fairly early small underfunded startup as said so every dollar counts and I do want to give value for the money they spent on me even if they dont continue with me).\n I wanted to ask you guys if you have any tips on how to succeed in this internship and how to make the shift from kaggle-notebooks code to production enviornment? I know I can do this I just need to get a grip of myself asap.\n Highly appreciate your help!\n    submitted by    /u/nuriel8833  \n [link]   [comments]",
