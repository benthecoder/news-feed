          "description": "I’m a (relatively) new user here, so I’d like to hear from users who have been around for a while (or mods). There have been a few recent posts about (or on) social media, which were not removed, but were both flagged and upvoted by a significant number of users:\nAre you still active in any social media platforms?\nStop writing Twitter threads\nThree things to like about the Fediverse\nFor what it’s worth, I did enjoy reading both of these threads—but I also recognize that the culture of lobste.rs is formed primarily from users who have been around much longer than I have. If these posts are indeed off-topic, should they be removed? If they are on-topic, should a new tag (social-media) be added? Given that a large amount of users are flagging these stories, there is a strong case for wanting to filter them out. A disclaimer would probably need to be added (similar to merkle-trees), stating something along the lines of non-technical discussions on social media or general business news of social media is not allowed.\nI double-checked the about page, and although many things are explicitly off-topic, social media is not mentioned:\nentrepreneurship, management, news about companies that employ a lot of programmers, investing, world events, anthropology, self-help, personal productivity systems, last-resort customer service requests via public shaming, “I wanted to see what this site’s amazing users think about this off-topic thing”, and defining the single morally correct economic and political system for the entire world when we can’t even settle tabs vs. spaces.",

Linkedin become a mess of self-promotion and some long stories with lots of likes but no points given - I deleted my Linkedin. Quora more and more getting bad content, the reason, the people I was there for no longer be there.\nMost of the time I always found myself bored and end up in scrolling down facebook/instagram/youtube reels for hours with no purpose - maybe to just to kill the time.\nConsidering delete all my accounts, maybe except Twitter - where some people I follow still posting.\nWhat about you? Are you still active in any social media platforms? What else beside these social media platforms and what do you think will be next after no one else using these platforms?",

          "description": "Hi HN! We’re building an open-source pricing & packaging engine for SaaS with a built-in billing system. (https://github.com/uselotus/lotus).\nWe strongly believe pricing is the largest untapped growth lever for SaaS, primarily because pricing affects so many critical systems that don’t talk to each other (billing, payments, feature limits, metering, and CRM). We’re building this infrastructure to fix this and enable quick experimentation.\nLotus acts as a central repository for all of your pricing plans and utilizes your payment gateway, to manage usage-based, per-seat, and custom enterprise pricing. We’re excited to open-source this because we want to enable developers to build their custom pricing and integration edge cases on top of this base.\nWe’ve launched this repo under an MIT license so any developer can use the tool. Give it a spin for us at either:\n* test our cloud version at (https://demo.uselotus.io)\n* self-host here (https://github.com/uselotus/lotus) \nand let us know what you think.\nAll feedback is appreciated! If the project is especially relevant to you, follow us and we’ll keep you updated when we’ve fully published all our beta features.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33494284\nPoints: 80\n# Comments: 24",

Plus the battery is awful. \n So for building a desktop gpu workstation:\n  \nHow important is nvlink or sli for scaling. Can PCI bus achieve the same using nvidia NCCL for scaling vram and cores in multiple gpus for bigger datasets? \n \nIf so, can I go with cheaper cards like 3060 12GB, and get 3-4 of them? How to determine a motherboard that can host multiple GPUs (not talking about multi gpu support plugs like nvlink sli etc)\n \nHow much ram, processor should I aim for let's say if my work is mostly in machine learning, scientific Computation using rapids, pycuda, numba etc, molecular modeling, and not just deep learning and neural networks.\n \nAlso how feasible are such desktops to use as remote servers. Say I wanted to use them at home but not necessarily in the same room, but via my light laptop. \n \n Will appreciate a ton.\n    submitted by    /u/macORnvidia  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are a couple of things I want to consider and hoping someone working as a data scientist in a government contract past/current could give me insight. \n 1) salary progression:\n I couldn't find good numbers on this except for individual company salaries such as Lockheed Martin pays data scientists(0-1 year) 107K compared to 108K which is the national average (glassdoor). how does the salary of a data scientist with Confidential security clearance in a government contract agency compare to those that don't do government contracting?\n 2) thing on the work.\n I came to data science from a statistics background but I soon realized that data scientist work involves very simple statistics for many different reasons (some good and some bad). The government hires a lot of statisticians so does data science work in government contracting involves more statistics (more than making KPI dashboards). I could like to keep up with modern tech stacks like working with data lakes,AWS, is that too much to ask?\n 3)work-life balance and management \n pretty simple how much do you work in a week and who do you report to?

          "description": "Okay, so I'm not a CS nor DS major, so please help me to understand if I'm wrong.\n Apparently, there were 3 V's originally (later they added other V's), but \"Velocity\" was there from the beginning.\n But according to the definition from Physics, \"speed denotes only how fast an object is moving, whereas velocity describes both how fast and in which direction the object is moving. If a car is said to travel at 60 km/h, its speed has been specified. However, if the car is said to move at 60 km/h to the north, its velocity has now been specified\".\n But data doesn't have any direction, does it? You can't say the terms \"uploading\" and \"downloading\" are supposed to mean the direction here, because when it comes to data-mining and data-processing (what big data is all about), it is always only about downloading, isn't it? When describing data, we can only specify the speed at which new data is coming, e.g. 1000 new data points are recorded every second, for example.\n I assume, those who came up with the 3 V's (or 4 V's, or 5 V's, or whichever V's), decided to use the word \"velocity\" (instead of \"speed\") although it's technically not correct, only because \"speed\" would ruin the mnemonic.\n Am I wrong?\n    submitted by    /u/angel19999  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am a 40 yr old product designer, iOS eng, react eng. I want to shift my career into AIML. I am wondering what the programs or courses I should look into are? \n I have looked at the Berkley, Stanford, MIT, Coursera, Udemy etc and am fairly aware of the options. But wanted to ask this community. \n I typically would just learn on youtube, github, stackoverflow etc but am considering making a more intentional and full time shift. I learn fine online but am considering an IRL program to fully immerse and dedicate 1-2 years of my time to it. So IRL or online courses?? Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/dubodubo  \n [link]   [comments]",
