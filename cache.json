          "description": "I want to know if this opportunity is good enough for my career path. I've given a summary of the events and my relevant experiences below:\n I've had experience as a data analyst at a tech company and before that I was doing business consulting projects. I got connected to an ERP company by one of my past colleagues and after one or two phone calls and a 20 minute phone interview about SQL stuff and accounting they told me I could have the job.\n My goal in my career is being a Data scientist who also does some of the analytics stuff for the company preferably focused on the business side of things but I like product-related tasks as well. This job includes mostly database administration tasks and trying to solve business problems for each client. \n The good thing about the opportunity is getting familiar with many different businesses and improving my business understanding. The downside is that I would be a little away from the roles I most like (DA/DS). Also, I would be more on the operation side of business instead of decision making side.(and on top of that dealing with finance and accounting people which I most probably wouldn't enjoy). All in all, I really like getting to solve varied problems for different business clients but I feel like this move would be a little out of the way for my career. Thanks for reading this far. I would appreciate any advices or opinions you have about this.\n    submitted by    /u/hosseinxj0152  \n [link]   [comments]",

Afterward, started to work as an analytics campaign manager in a healthcare company. My job covered making sure the architecture was working correctly to using basic algorithms like K-means, and logistic regression to create campaigns to increase cx and sales. My job was very satisfactory in a way as I could see cancer patients struggling less or people would find they had cancer in the early stages and could get treatment before it was late. \n ​\n Due to financial reasons, I decided to become a data scientist, did a master and found a job in Western Europe. I'm working at a consulting company where I just do the analytics and prepare presentations but all the interesting stuff like creating the solution, and presenting it to the client belongs to other people. I'm just doing my 'numbers magic' - whatever they asked me to do- and they do all the fun stuff. The worst part is whatever I do is just for companies to save money, it doesn't affect people in any way. \n ​\n I can't go back to my old work because I have to stay in Europe to make the money and send it to my parents. And my visa allows me just to do technical jobs, nothing like marketing, sales etc... \n ​\n I feel stuck but don't know what to do.

          "description": "Hi all, thanks in advance for your advice.\n I'm trying to determine whether certain product feature improvements increased the number of monthly active users (active is defined as whether the user made a purchase in the last 28 days). We have the ability to A/B test but I'm getting stuck because this MAU metric is a moving window metric. If we run the experiment for exactly 28 days then I think calculating the impact to MAU is easy. But most of the time our experiments run for more or less days than 28 days. Below are a few scenarios to illustrate my point.\n Note: All scenarios are A/B tests where we split our user base into equal treatment and control groups. So far, I've been calculating \"MAU Rate\", which is the proportion of users who placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment.\n  \nScenario 1: Run experiment for exactly 28 days. At the end of 28 days, simply compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order.\n Scenario 2: Run experiment for less than 28 days, say 14 days. At the end of the experiment, compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment. The issue is that this will include days from before the experiment started. If I use only the days during the experiment, then I'm not really measuring MAU since MAU is 28 days and the experiment ran for only 14 days.\n Scenario 3: Run experiment for more than 28 days, say 35 days. At the end of the experiment, compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment. The issue is that this will exclude data from the first 7 days of the experiment. If I use all the days during the experiment, then I'm not really measuring MAU since MAU is 28 days and the experiment ran for 35 days.\n  \nDoes anyone have any advice on how to measure impact to MAU through experimentation?

It was suppose to be just a dashboard but ended up being an automation piece so it was taken over by senior members in the team. \n My second project came along a few months later, but the data engineer has been having ongoing issues with the data being sent over from an external provider, so that’s been a blocker, but the data modelling and dashboard design is done. \n I was given a third project 2 months ago, a simple data model clean up and redesign of an existing dashboard, that didn’t take long and the dashboard is live now.\n It is the new year now and I truly have nothing to do. The last 8 months has been me looking for work to do, I’ve asked to help out on other team member projects but they said they didn’t need it. We have a daily stand up where we give updates and talk about what we’ll be doing today. Today was the first day I couldn’t bs my way through the meeting and said I didn’t have an update. I feel really incompetent having nothing to do. It’s isn’t a fast paced company so there aren’t millions of things going on, and our data team didn’t exist just 4 years ago so the business doesn’t rely on us too much. \n Only 3 projects in the last 8 months, is this normal? If you currently work in data was your first job similar to my experience?? I’m struggling to understand why they hired me in the first place, I don’t think there’s enough work for an extra person.\n Should I start looking for another job?
