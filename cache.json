I wrote my code/notes in Vim, browsed the web with elinks, and wrote my emails using mutt. It was a great learning experience.\nRecently I looked into doing this again and ran into a bunch of issues:\n- My company uses Slack's enterprise auth, and all the CLI slack clients I could find haven't been updated in years and no longer work.\n- The web is using more javascript than in the past.\n- Mutt doesn't handle multiple email accounts natively for work/personal. The solutions are hacks at best. Email servers are starting to use more complete auth mechanisms that don't work well with mutt.\nIt seems like the terminal world is slowly getting abandoned in favor of proprietary GUI apps. Anyone still living inside the terminal? Links to tools for Slack are appreciated.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33205970\nPoints: 182\n# Comments: 165",

My question is, any resource online where I can start learning about deployment?

The unneeded dimensions don't learn anything meaningful and therefore remain a standard, multivariate, Gaussian distribution. This serves as a signal that such dimensions can safely be removed without significantly impacting the model's performance.\n I have implemented quite a few of them which can be referred to here.\n Am I right with my hypothesis?

I am thinking of applying for a sabbatical this year, to give my self time to complete a data science certificate. I am curious what people think would be the most valuable use of my time. I am not new to data, so don't want to start with the basics. I'd also like to do something that still allows me to use Stata to some degree. Any thoughts out there as to which path to take?\n Summary: I have a Phd in Economics, and am not new to data.

This routine always generates the same sized property vector, independent of system matrix size.
