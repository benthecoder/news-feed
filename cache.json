          "description": "Hi, I am currently in a master's program for applied data science. Our program does not require a thesis, rather 3 large projects (2 milestone projects and a capstone). I am at the end of my program and the capstone is approaching in two months where I will have 3 months to turn in a project that \"shows I've pushed my abilities to their limits\". The project is very open ended, no specific requirements, other than I have to make use of a publicly available dataset. \n My issue is that after 2 other milestone projects which I've poured my heart into, I feel completely burned out and lacking ideas. My first two projects were centered around NLP and processing twitter data to extract meaningful emotional sentiments which were then used in different forecasting scenarios to predict emotions by topic. Both projects recieved high grades and I feel like I've exhausted my interest using NLP and social media data. \n For the capstone I'd like to look at something that is more in line with a \"wicked problem\". One suggested project is to help the Allen Institute for Brain Science by providing insight to their publicly available dataset. This is something I really like, as it could have a meaningful impact, and it contributes to a larger altruistic cause. \n My question to this community is: Are you aware of other institutes and/or communities that have available data which can be analyzed toward a greater good? Consortiums that are asking the public for help on a problem. \n Honestly I'm not sure what I should be searching for. I'm trying to create a list and I've looked into cancer data sets, alzheimer's, all the big diseases, but I can't seem to find a topic that hasn't been analyzed to death. Any fresh perspectives would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Obvious-Pin7718  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There are quite a few recent posts about pros and cons of Jupyter in the DS field and I don't want to add to that. My question is more about tooling prevalent in corporate environments. Most of the time Python DS stack is limited to remotely hosted Jupyter lab instances (in contrast R stack includes paid subscriptions to Rstudio server, which is a great tool that can live in a browser!)\n What are the options available of one wants a hybrid IDE + Notebook workspace if ssh is blocked (almost all the time in corporate)\n I feel like Jupyter is hindering a push towards a Foss or paid alternate to Rstudio server for python. (I've heard VS code is attempting sever side tool which can be accessed through the browser but not sure if it's available for production (corporate use) yet. I know there can be workarounds using paid (new rstudio for python) options but since jupiter is so widespread its really hard to get the heads to spend money on something new and untested. \n I'm surprised that as a community we seem to be content with J.\n    submitted by    /u/darthstargazer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Good evening everyone,\n I have a task with a client, he gave me a dataset full of hotel description and I must add tags to them. A tag can be \"own_outdoor_pool\", \"close_to_beach\", \"luxe\" just to give some examples. As it is real world data, we cannot do supervised ML or DL as the dataset is not labelled with those tags. What I do right now, is to do a subsentence segmentation with a DL model, I build an \"initialisation file\" where I give for the tag an initialisation sentence, let's have the tag \"own_outdoor_pool\" some initialisation sentences could be for exemple \"outdoor pool in the hotel\", \"a pool located outside\", \"you can find a pool in the garden\", and I do this for every tag. Then I do sentence embedding with a NLP model for the subsentences of each description and each initialisation sentence and I compute a cosine distance of each subsentence of the description of the hotel with all the initialisation sentences for each tag. It works pretty well, the highest distance gives the good tag usually, I also put a treshold aroung 0.55 to avoid useless tag for not relevant subsentences. The issue that I have is with overlapping tag such as \"heated_pool\", \"indoor_pool\", outdoor_pool\". As the initialisation sentences for these 3 tags are similar, the distance with subsentences of a given hotel description that have pool in them will have a high cosine distance with these 3 tags. A subsentences with heated pool will have high cosine similarity with the two tags \"indoor_pool\" and \"outdoor_pool\" where I want to get the tag \"heated_pool\".\n I am thinking to use the inverse of a penalty, meaning that I would like to increase the significance of a word such as indoor, outdoor or heated to get the proper tag. Yet, I do not know how to do it. Do anyone here can give me a hint? Some ressources available? Thank you in advance.\n NB: Sorry for my english, not my lative language.\n    submitted by    /u/dekozr  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, how's it going? I want to start studying the world of AI but I am not clear on a topic. From what I understand and I was informing myself, the AI ​​is divided into two large branches. On the one hand, deep learning and machine learning. Deep learning has algorithms that are more similar to how a human being processes information, more intelligent, so to speak. Machine learning algorithms are more focused on learning with large amounts of data, this would cover what big data is and all that field. I am right? What known algorithms are developed with machine learning and deep learning?\n    submitted by    /u/sergiCrack9  \n [link]   [comments]",

The solution for all these problems was to run Machine Learning models on local devices “Edge ML”.\n Edge ML is a technology that allows Smart Devices to analyse data locally utilising machine and deep learning algorithms, decreasing dependency on Cloud networks. This article will be focused on understanding the working and functionality of Edge Machine Learning.

          "description": "AlphaGo was able to surpass a human because it can play itself a million times in an hour. I got to thinking if an AI could be trained on complex video games like Skyrim in the same way.\n A human has to play a game like Skyrim for a hundred hours but a computer wouldn't have to \"play\" the game to experience it. It could just look at the code and execute it in the mind's eye without being real time. Similar to it creating a virtual machine and playing the game in the virtual machine so the game doesn't know it's being played in fast forward.\n Experiencing a game by interpreting the EXE would be magnitudes more efficient than actually playing the game though because it would understand what the game looks like with textures loaded without having to actually render every frame with them. It could \"play\" the game in wireframe a thousand seconds per second if it would even experience the game in that way while interpreting the code directly.\n A system like this could \"experience\" thousands of games (Witcher, Zelda, etc) and learn how to imagine different games. A text-to-game system similar to current text-to-image.\n    submitted by    /u/sasksean  \n [link]   [comments]",
