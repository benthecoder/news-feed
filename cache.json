          "description": "When fitting a Tweedie distribution to my dataset of counts in R, I build a model like this:\n model <- glm(target_collision_count ~ brake_count + distraction_count + following_distance_count + offset(log(trip_mileage)), maxit = 100,data = train_df, family = tweedie(var.power=1,link.power=0))\n I know the dispersion parameter is estimated by maximum likelihood, and it scales up the variance.\n I run my regression and I get some very high p-values around 0.7 with a dispersion parameter of about 200. Then, when I manually set the dispersion like this\n summary(model, dispersion = 1)\n The coefficients are unchanged , but my p-values are now all around 0 and the standard errors are way smaller. The smaller I make the dispersion parameter, the more significant my p-values and the smaller the standard errors.\n I'm wondering is manually adjusting the dispersion like this bad. It seems like without changing my coefficients, I can just manually scale the dispersion and get significant p-values?\n Below are examples. On one, the dispersion parameter is left as is and the p values are way high. On the other, the disperison parameter is set to one and results are significant.\n https://preview.redd.it/7pkc9srbhq7a1.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8fd1a37978c592a2685005bf3afe529ba8a7a89\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/6ttnjbwchq7a1.png?width=527&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5a279757a628ed31671ca2c30300f26882efb84\n ​\n ​\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Significant-Work-204  \n [link]   [comments]",

Extract raw data > ETL > visualization\n It is... Extract raw data > ETL > customer modification > load > visualization\n Is there a term for this (two load cycles)?

I tried working on data science projects, but I couldn't get a good revenue flow, so I eventually settled on making web scraping scripts. That works well; I have projects and get paid well. But eventually, it got a bit boring, so I'm looking for other types of tasks.\n Ideally, something with machine learning, but I'd be ok with other data-related tasks. The point is to gain more experience; I don't mind if I won't earn any significant money from it in the short run (but I would want to make sure that I specialize in something that has an actual market).\n Due to my existing clients, I only have about 10-20 hours a week free, and I would prefer to do projects that are short (ideally under 1-2 months).\n Do you know of any subfields I could specialize in, do some projects on my own and then do it a \"service\"? My current proposition is something like \"build a scraper script for any site\", so something like that. I feel like \"I will build an ML model for you\" or \"I will analyze your data\" is way too broad, and also the good projects in similar fields would be too large commitments for me.\n I'm not sure if there is anything like what I'm looking for, but if anyone has some ideas that I can then think about more in-depth, I'd be grateful.

I don't have many close friends that are very interested in AI so I figured I might turn to Reddit for some constructive feedback. The intent of this series will be to cover AI news once every few weeks, and to have it be centered around content that appeals to a diverse audience (from fellow tech nerds, to your parents alike).\n I know the text scrolling is not great so I will work on figuring out something better for the next video, but any other suggestions or advice on how I can improve this are greatly appreciated!\n AI News - Episode 1 - Dec. 2022 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtjY_dINLyU\n    submitted by    /u/Kitten-Smuggler  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I asked chatgpt which animal was the biggest; a whale shark or an elephant (inspired by a LinkedIn-post).\n Chatgpt claims the elephant is bigger even though it’s wrong.\n I therefore started wondering how reliable a (C)NN (or other subsymbolic method) can become as a AI. I think many people regard chatgpt as a kind of AGI and not as amodel who can put words nicely together (which in itself is super impressive).\n Do we expect reasoning and logic to arrive with more parameters and model layers? Or should we always except these models to make mistakes? Doesn’t mathematical logic require hard coded rules and not (gradient descent) optimized models?\n What I’m asking is: are the NN approach ever gonna achieve reliable logic?\n (I’m really not a gpt hater! I got huge respect for the work of openai!!)\n    submitted by    /u/Keepitsimpleistaken  \n [link]   [comments]",
