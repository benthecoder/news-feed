For an assignment I have to choose an area of interest in AI and then do a case study on it. The area I have chosen is AI and health. My idea is an adaptation of a specific program in Ready Player One. In basic you have a watch that you wear (like a fitbit) and it monitors your health. Say you get dehydrated it won't allow you to go on any games or social media until you have drunk water. Is there any program already like this or anyone experimenting in this area?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two binary variables, that I want to put in 4 different classes. Also, I have a small dataset (N=110) that is unbalanced (e.g., group 3 has only three observations) and I want to make predictions. Obviously the predictions that I did for the unbalanced dataset are pretty bad, because error rates for minority classes are 100%. However, I upsampled the dataset, and now I have the problem that minority classes get 0% error rate, but majority classes have almost 100% error. I am using random forest and SVM. Is it better to perform two binary classification problems than do one 4 level classification?
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am fresh grad working at a startup with around 20 people. And basically, Im having a very hard time showing them how to do AB testing properly. They have definitely made a lot of progress over the past 6 months but I feel like it's not enough. For example: When I came in, they used to carry out some AB tests without control groups, and when they did, the sample sizes were guessed completely at random, "ah let's have 100 in control and 55000 in the test group because we know that the treatment group is going to be positive anyways. "
 The problem is that I am not taking part in the experiment design and I am only learning about their experiment after it has ended. They only come to me when they need an analysis done. "Hey we did this experiment 4 weeks ago. Can you tell us if A outperformed B?"
 Logically I must be involved in these experiments from the very start, and no experiments should be run without my approval. But, being the stats nerd that I am, how can I convince a team of extroverted marketing people that I'm important for ab testing?

        <link href="https://docs.cdrplatform.com/"/>
        <updated>2022-11-10T18:37:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
We're Fabienne and Ewan of Climacrux. Today we're proud to launch our latest project to try and make carbon dioxide removal as accessible as possible: CDR Platform [1].
In short: it’s an API to connect to a portfolio of carbon removers. You can purchase from as low as a single gram and select from both natural and technological removal methods.
Longer: A couple of years ago we launched an alternative to carbon credits, Carbon Removed[2], designed for individuals to buy and subscribe to CDR. But we always had the nagging thought that there was more that could be done.
CDR Platform is our foundation for that - a simple API to get prices and purchase (at the moment). Our plan is to become the Stripe of the carbon removal ecosystem, seamlessly connecting the supply to the demand.
We’d love to hear your feedback. Do you see a use case for this and would you use it? What features have we missed? Do you understand what we’re doing and if not, what’s unclear? We’d love to hear from you.[3]
Many thanks and happy hacking, Climacrux.
P.s. If you are a carbon remover, send us your prices, life cycle analysis and some more information about your removal timeline. Our aim is to bring your services to a wider audience so you can focus on reducing our CO₂ levels. Thanks for your work!

I want to find a tool that can use google earth and count the number of visible vegetable gardens in a given area. Does something exist where I could train it by selecting a bunch of vegetable gardens and then test it in another area?
 I’m not finding a good answer to this by searching, so I thought I would ask the good people of r/datascience. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I'm launching Postcard!
I started Postcard when I deleted most social media, but still wanted a way to keep in touch with friends and my network.
When I worked at Webflow, it became clear to me that most website builders are way too complex for individual users. So, I drew inspiration from social media - where all you need is a couple photos and text fields to get a great site online. So, I think I’ve about achieved a site builder that even my Mom could use.
The product seems simple, but there are many under-the-hood optimizations. There's caching, CDNs, custom domain support, TLS certificate issuance + management, dynamically-generated open graph images, image optimizations, email sending, full-text RSS feed, email reputations, and more. It also uses a couple new products to make the domain connection process easy.
Let me know if you have any feedback or questions!
PS - Rumor is that Twitter is shutting down Revue. If you want help transferring content and subscribers over to Postcard, just email me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got feedback for an interview that I didn't get. Apparently the technical skills of the chosen candidate were more or less neck and neck with mine, but the decider was that the other person came across as better on a dimension that to me is a little more vague... basically they said the other candidate asked more of the right questions about the business, they somehow inspired more confidence in the stakeholder interview. I guess they across as someone who is less passive, someone who will take the reins and be more of a leader. 
 My mindset is more like "ok so this company needs an ml model, a db, an ETL setup, dashboards, ab testing etc..." for me things are more concrete, and I feel like I would rather leave "driving the business" to the managers, but in reality a data scientist needs these skills as well. What do you think? Are these skills that one can still develop? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I'm working on a side project that involves transcription and speaker identification for audio files (podcasts, presentations, etc.), and I'm wondering if the community has any advice for Google Cloud Platform architecture.
 A few things to note:
 ​
  
I will likely NOT be using Google's Speach-to-Text, since I have been getting better quality results with solutions like Whisper and Assembly AI. Therefore, I will need to build Python code as part of the solution to process the audio files and pass them to Whisper/Assembly AI
 It would be nice to set up a trigger that starts the flow whenever a new audio file is placed in a bucket
 We will be processing, potentially, up to a few hundred hours of audio per month (and likely more in the future)
  
One solution I was thinking of was creating a Cloud Function that was triggered when an audio file was placed in a storage bucket. The Cloud Function would then process the file and update a database with the transcription and speaker identification.
 If anyone has experience with or suggestions for how to go about this, please let me know!

Recently at Google’s I/O 2018 event, they demonstrated a phone call conversation between the google assistant and a real person. The reason behind the realistic conversation is, of course, the intelligence but also the voice of the AI. The technology used to create a similar realistic voice is called Speed synthesis. In this article, we will be discussing one of the speech synthesis algorithms and try to learn about the architecture and working of the neural vocoder. Following are the topics to be covered.

 Here is the complete text.
 ​
 Data Scientists leaving big tech companies are about to be swept up by traditional industries who are desperate for talent. Most won’t do well. Why? 
  
The data science tools, data infrastructure, and IT support they depend on aren’t there. 
 
The budget and data team size are much smaller. 
 
Specialized roles don't exist and data scientists are expected to play multiple roles. 
 
The business isn’t data or AI-first and it has other priorities above innovation. 
 
Internal users and customers aren’t data literate and technically inclined. 
 
Leadership isn't bought in and must be convinced before initiatives move forward. 
 
Relationships and communications channels between engineering and the business haven't been fully built. 
 
There's little to no prioritization process or filter between users and the team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tbh I follow a lot of programming/tech/data subs and this one is oddly toxic and “gatekeepy” to newcomers. It’s pretty good for intellectual topics but if you’re new and looking for advice, guidance, etc.. this may not be the place. definitely check out r/learndatascience just like r/learnprogramming but alas this is all we have ( or maybe not, post other learning subs if you have them). 
 My main point is don’t take anything to heart. Ask away but take everything with a grain of salt. 100% continue on your path and goals because everyone starts somewhere and I hope this reaches you. You can make a difference or career on this field. There’s constantly new architectures and algos being thought of daily to tackle new domains that work way bette than the last. 
 TLDR: DON’T GIVE UP

I am able to use Menn-Kendall test to check for upwards and downwards trends, but I was wondering is there an anomaly detection algorithm that doesn't depend on seasonality? or any other research you can point me to on the topic? I am reading about isolation forest and SSA time series decomp to see if they are helpful, but would appreciate other sources
 Thanks
