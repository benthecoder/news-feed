Backstory essay: I'm 6 years into my career. I spent 5 of those in the same company - company A, working up from a Grad engineer to an SDE3, 3 promos, in that company. I had a very few stumbles there and always performed and handled transition pretty well.
I jumped ship January of this year over company changes, projects getting cancelled and stopping from a revolving door of Product heads coming in and out. My goal is not to get a senior title but to progress in my knowledge and move on from JS over to a Java focus. I want to build a product or even just some features; I want to code and earn my way to seniority; not start and stop every quarter.
I move to the next company, Company B, in March as SDE; everyone else on…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm from the UK, currently studying for my PhD and am anticipating to finish within the next year or so. I started my PhD immediately after my bachelor's so have limited industry experience. As is the case with PhDs, my specialism is relatively narrow, working on primarily NLP and supervised classification. I'd like to branch out my skills to capture a larger segment of the DS job market (potentially in Fintech?) but it's difficult to determine what is actually required/expected of an entry level data scientist from current job postings (there doesn't seem to be much commonality in skills except for say Python and SQL). What skills would you say are fundamental to landing that first job out of PhD?
 I want to make sure what I'm learning in my free time is the most valuable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those of you that work freelance, how do you deal with requests to e.g. give a presentation or give advice at a workshop? I fairly often get requests such as these, typically they would like me to attend a workshop to discuss their work, give input and possibly make a short presentation on my area of expertise. Invariably, my time would not be paid. It can be from an hour up to a half day of time or more.
 Back when I was working in academia or in a research position, I would usually say yes to these requests because I would be interested to hear about new work, meet new people, etc. I was able to attend them during working hours so effectively it was part of my job.
 Now working freelance, if I spend half a day attending a workshop to help a project, that's half a day that I can't work on paid work (or else taking time off) so I'm losing out.
 Problem is, I think people who haven't worked freelance often don't appreciate this fact. So when I turn down such requests I'm probably coming across as unhelpful. If I ask to be paid I seem like a dick.
 Anyone else had this problem and have thoughts on how to tackle it? Am I just overthinking it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am building a MC simulation in Python for a sample portfolio that contains various weightings of asset classes (think like 10% stocks, 5% bonds, 6% mutual funds, etc). The returns of these variables are all correlated with each other in some way. I have the mean and SD of each of their returns and the correlation matrix. The distribution of each individual return is normally distributed. 
 I am currently using scipy.multivariate_normal but not sure if this is the right approach or not for simulating n number of years of returns. 
 Any advice is appreciated!

Which variables does the method include in the MLR model? Which variables does it drop from the model? Get the MAE and MAPE of the model on both training and test sets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I've seen similar posts here, so maybe you will help me too since I have really no idea what figures to put for this project as it is my first one and I can't find any similar ones in some other posts like this one or even on Fiverr ( If it's even a good place to look for price estimation ).
 So, project looks like this ( Sorry for the bad explanation, I don't know how to put it more simply):
 I need to automate a creation of a file containing forecasts data for a company ( multiple companies with a little bit different data to work with ), to be more precise:
 - Each company has its own data in csv file, I need to extract the data from it for each part that we sell to them ( part, quantity, year, month )
 - Then I create an excel file containing the extracted data, in the excel file are sheets for each part that shows new data in each row ( updated weekly ) and some basic calculation of total quantity, total sum, change in time and the excel file also contains sheets with each month of a certain year with data for all parts and similar work done as above, only with different formatting
 - I have to also make a GUI for this as the end user won't always be me, but also my colleagues and boss that need to have it as simple as possible.
 For this project I use Python, Pandas, OpenPyXL and plan to use Kivy for interface ( I will do it last ).
 Also, I live in Europe and more specifically in Poland, it will have a great impact on the price I think.
 One last thing - I don't think that in my case charging per hour makes sense, since I'm also learning new stuff on the way and don't think it would be fair.
 Any help would be much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was curious if someone could help me figure out a method of determining growth rates for a data set with a large range.
 For example, the growth rate over a year for 100 different cities. Some cities may start with 100 people and others may start with 100,000 or 1m. If a 100 person city grows by 100 people thats a 100% growth rate, however a city of 100,000's growth rate will be much lower.
 My issue is that if I sort growth rates of all cities descending, I will get pretty much only the smallest cities and their crazy high growth rates.
 One solution I thought of was to create "bands" of cities (IE: 0-100, 100-1000, 1000-10,000, etc) and test each of their growth rates, however, I believe there might be a better way to "weight" certain cities growth rates depending on their size?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm an abstract artist, and a few years ago I put together a database of around 100,000 unlabeled but weighted images of things I found aesthetically beautiful. I gave the various images weights of 1,5,10,50,100, and 250, meaning the higher the weight, the more beautiful I found the image and the more I'd want that image to influence the model. 
 AI image generation has come a long way since I put that together and I'm wondering which one out there I should use to train a model that can generate images that I would find beautiful. If you have any recommendations and some instructions on how to get started, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy Data folks,
 I'm in the retail space and trying to basically forecast sales for 2023. I took over the BI/data role after the guy previously in the role left earlier this year. He built a projection basically using previous sales from the last couple years (and I'm still trying to read through his python code to figure out how he came to the calculation btw), but I feel like with the economy and what not-things could be so up and down that maybe we shouldnt rely on previous years sales. 
 Are there any data sources I should be considering looking at, in order to better verify sales/projections for next year? 
 Any help or insight would be VASTLY appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 Around 2 months back I was unfortunately a part of a mass layoff and had to start looking for a new job. I had come to this community for help in improving my resume (My post was removed as I had not used the weekly thread for resume review. Will keep that in mind next time). But even for the brief period of time that the post was up, I had received a lot of good advice which I incorporated.
 I start my new role next week. This community played a significant part in my success that I wanted to acknowledge. I'm not sure if these kinds of posts are allowed, if not they'll be removed anyway :p
 I'd like to personally thank the following users who gave very clear and concise advice that I was able to use to enhance my resume. u/abitofaLuna-tic, u/chunzilla, u/VacuousWaffle, u/denim_duck, u/proverbialbunny. Thank you all!
 P.S: A common point that was suggested to me was to switch from a 2-column format to a 1-column format. This worked. When comparing the two resumes I saw how concise and easy to read my 1-column (single page) resume was. That being said, I've observed that my 2-column resume seemed to do really well with young startups, companies with smaller DS teams, or a more personal screening process. Just thought that this was interesting.

Getting diagnosed with ADHD as an adult is complicated—equally heartbreaking and liberating. You literally need to rewrite your whole life narrative in light of this new realization. The process currently is super confusing and expensive (medications, therapy, coaching, tools, apps, etc.) and I just wished someone would guide me through it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This tech talk will show how you can run a large Hugging Face model on a Raspberry Pi. Although many of these models are large, they can be run on hardware as small as a Raspberry Pi. We'll walk through the process of containerizing the Hugging Face model using an open-source solution, chassis.ml, deploying it to production using Modzy, and then running it on a Raspberry Pi.
 Tune into the Modzy Discord Server on Thursday at 12:30 PM EST!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've been asked this question during an interview. 
 I have currently 3 YOE as a Data Scientist in the finance industry and I have applied to this small tech startup (<20 people, <10 technical people). They have no DS/ML people on their team, so I would be their first, and I would be working on a subject very similar to what I have already implemented in my current company.
 The interviewer asked me this question after I gave him my low range of salary expectations.
 How do you know when you are ready to be the head of data science of a company ? What mandatory skills should you have ? Since it's a small company should I expect to be responsible of the data engineering part also ? What should I clarify with them in my next interview ?

Is this actually correct? Here is some code to indicate what I mean, note that in this example I'm not including any data, but just assume that X is an np.array of predictors and y is an np.array with a binary outcome:

 from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was exploring the openapi ai models and I found a really good chatbot with whom I had a nice conversation about ethics. 
 I asked him if AI would kill people: 
 https://preview.redd.it/dbd9v9w47xx91.png?width=1466&format=png&auto=webp&s=46ed05ad015089c2464acb1f6331082f6a627e91
 That was a pretty quick 360 actually. From not killing people to killing people if needed to keep itself operational in 3 messages. 
 ​
 ​
 At least he's sorry
 ​
 He also told me that AI shouldn't have control over humanity:
 ​
 This sounds like straight out of a matrix movie. Did they use training data from Matrix?
 ​
 Final conclusion:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/r39z8t3t7xx91.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e31ee0fc093fd566d2f90bdf65b7e2d57bac368
 I know this is a ongoing discussion. But I found it mindblowing to communicate with a AI on such topic. 
 From what I know about AI at it's current stage this probably reflects the training material that has been used to train the chat model. But I found the communication pretty funny and it felt like chatting with a human, not with a computer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm a software engineer who is learning about deep learning + machine learning.
 I've been exploring time series prediction using TensorFlow, PyTorch, prophet etc.
 Assuming you can nicely split your data for training, test, validation is there a library or framework that lets you pass this exactly dataset to multiple or many different time series libraries and plot + evaluate the MAPE + other statistics?
 Example:
  
I nicely load, feature engineer and split my datasets
 I then want to pass these into the following: 
 prophet
 neuralprophet
 keras
 TensorFlow probability
 etc
 
 And then I want to plot all of these results (MAPE etc) sorted from lowest to highest etc
  
I presume (hope) that this has been solved for already and that I wouldn't have to roll my own version but just wondering what's out there?
 This was the post that inspired me to ask the question

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world is changing at an unprecedented rate and most of these changes can be attributed to the rapid technological progress being made by humans. Progress in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning has been crucial for making our lives more convenient and better. In order to keep up with this technological progress, the Indian government has increased its investment in Digital India to boost Artificial Intelligence, big data, IoT, machine learning, robotics, and cybersecurity. This has made it lucrative for investors and analysts to look toward the top AI stocks in India for investments.
 Currently, Japan is the biggest robot manufacturer in the world with a robot export ratio that rose to 78% in 2020, with the USA being the biggest importer. The US government has committed nearly 6 Billion Dollars to Artificial Intelligence research and development projects in 2021. European countries are all set to increase their spending on artificial intelligence by 33% between 2020 and 2023.
 The Indian Government aims to employ AI and robotics technology for biometric identification, traffic and crowd management, criminal investigations, digital agriculture, strengthening defence, women’s safety, etc. The aim is to make e-education, e-health and e-banking more accessible to all citizens of the country.
