It seems that lately attackers are more successful by targeting administrators or developers than attacking the actual deployments and servers.  Meanwhile some attacks social engineer employees into credential theft or reset, other attacks go after operational credentials that are used in semi-automated operations or development scripts.
To be clear, I don’t want to focus on the issue of secure online credential management (I hope we all use some form of password manager), or the security of online authentication protocols (even OAuth seems to be lacking), or the security of MFAs, not even the security of cloud API keys that are actively used by unattended running services (if the attacker has compromised the actual server he most…]]></summary>

 Jupyter => No documented code completion.
 Rstudio => No documented code completion for python.
 Jetbrains... F jetbucks.

 Currently, work as a data scientist in an insurance company (less than 1 year of job experience), but my plan is to get into Amazon or Meta as a data scientist as the next step. 
 My current data scientist position is mainly about data cleaning, building, and improving ML models using Python.
 I do not have that much experience in Cloud and Big Data frameworks such as Spark, and my current employer does not provide such possibilities either.
 My plan is to learn cloud (AWS or GCP) and focus on Leet Code for this. I consider 12 months for improving my resume and boosting the required skills. Considering my knowledge in SQL, Python, and ML, do you think improving my knowledge/experience in Cloud and Leet Code is a good package for a job change to Amazon or Meta? Do you recommend any other skillset such as Spark, etc?
 Thank you so much!

The format is something like: order number, client name, picture of design selected and info about design (quantity for example), then the other product, followed by a dash line to indicate the order is over and then repeat same format for new order. 
 Now we have one guy who’s only task is to copy paste that data into word and print is as purchase order. I want to automate this process by directly somehow having people input the data into WhatsApp and it getting converted and pasted to word, so then end of the day all I have to do is to print all. 
 Any help is much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a PhD in Engineering and currently working as a data scientist in an insurance company in Toronto (less than 1 year of job experience), but my plan is to get into Meta or at least Amazon as a data scientist as the next step. My current data scientist position is mainly about data cleaning, building, and improving ML models using Python. I do not have that much experience in Cloud and Big Data frameworks such as Spark, and my current employer does not provide such possibilities either.
 Is working in an insurance company is a negative point for me as in LinkedIn I rarly see someone in FAANG coming from insurance companies or at least they have experience in tech/banking/retail industries on top of insurance.
 Do you think that having work experience just in insurance vs other industries would decrease my chances for FAANG?
 If so, do you recommend me to change my current employer or just covering missed skillsets by myself (I mean cloud by online training and big data by personal projects)?
 ​
 Any recommendations are welcome.
 Thank you so much!

 My goal is to gain experience and become competitive for a FAANG internship, since I'm at a uni not as prestigious as the top schools with top programs. I know I have to probably get some projects done on the side to build my resume, but I can do that on my free time. Any advice welcome.

 Say I have multiple stores selling multiple products, mulitiple categories, etc. Say on X date, I see a drop in sales but I want the algorithm to say that this was caused by "store X" which didnt sell much that day, or it was caused by "Product Y" suddenly dropping that day. 
 How would you approach this? I tried pycaret and it had an example for anomaly detection, but what I'm looking is to drill down the anomaly instead and find out which variables/predictors are causing the anomaly. 
 The data could look like (sales total would the be 'outcome variable'):
 date, store, product, country, .... ... sales_total

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! Are you a data enthusiast looking for opportunities to highlight your work and win cash prizes? Interested in researching how access to green space impacts public health? If the answer is yes, then the Green Space Data Challenge hosted by the Massive Data Institute at Georgetown’s McCourt School of Public Policy is for you! 
 Undergraduate students, graduate students, and early-career professionals are invited to participate in the data challenge during the entire month of February 2023 to create or improve indicators involving green space to better understand and measure community impact. 
 Participants will access various data sources on our Redivis platform in individual or team notebooks to transform green space data into community indicators. They will conduct their analyses and submit a short project narrative that describes the research question, analytic approach, and key findings. All submissions will be evaluated by judges based on the relevance, completeness, and quality of the submission. 
 There will be separate prize categories for submissions examining the effects of green space on the following subject areas: community health, community safety, specific populations, and physical environment. Winners can receive $5,000 for first place prizes, $2,000 for second place prizes, and $1,000 for third place prizes. Winners will also be invited to present their project at a webinar hosted by the Association of Public Data Users (APDU) and at APDU’s annual conference in July 2023. 
 Click here to learn more about the data challenge and to register.
 Please help us spread the word and invite anyone eligible in your networks!

I have always been interested in studying abroad, but due to covid and the nature of my major I was unable to find opportunities. I am now looking for jobs abroad, but the process has been complicated and uneventful. I go to a school that qualifies me for the UK High Potential Individual visa, but every job I've applied to in the UK has rejected me. I've also looked at jobs in Switzerland and France, but their immigration laws are incredibly strict. My question follows: As an American, have you ever worked abroad as a data scientist in another country, and if so, when in your career and how?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am currently a political science major about to graduate and I don't really like it. I've been getting into data science/data analysis recently by doing some courses on Coursera and EDX, and I'm loving it. I've always been an analytical thinker, and I'm great at finding patterns and connections, and I have great logical thinking skills.
 I am yet to learn Python, SQL, R, etc. more in-depth, but I have learned over 17 languages. Even if it doesn't seem like programming languages and natural languages have anything in common, I'd like to differ, since both of them require learning a different code, structure, and usage, so I'm used to organizing my ideas using different patterns.
 I have heard many stories of people in similar situations who came from fields completely unrelated to data science that managed to thrive upon doing some courses on the internet and maybe getting some certificates elsewhere. I am afraid that it's too late for me to even attempt to join the field and I'd like to know if there's anyone with an unconventional trajectory through data science.
 I know this is something I enjoy, and I would like to put to use my analytical/mathematical/logical thinking skills which in political science would be useless. I don't know, however, if this is within my realm of possibilities.
 I know most of you are math or engineering graduates, so I'd like to know if many of you are not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The masters in question. 
 I have a background in biology and a little organic chemistry (final semester in my bachelors) but realised I also appreciate math and programming during my internship and final year project. (I went through almost half of the chapters in linear algebra and its applications by David C. Lay, completing 80% of its associated problems and felt like it was as fun as playing Monster Hunter World or Guild Wars 2.)
 However, I am unable to find any placement statistics for the masters, is this considered a red flag? Additionally, MH6211 Analytics Software I and MH6212 Analytics Software II cover SPS which according to some, is not really used in industry? I was also unable to find any reviews. I googled the degree on linkedin and found that some alumni who had the degree are still data analysts 4 years after the degree while others are data scientists. Are data analysts considered entry level positions compared to data scientists? Can someone point out anything that stands out in the curriculum?
 Am I better off with Georgia Tech’s Online Master of Science in Analytics (OMS Analytics)? I do have some basic knowledge of linear algebra, programming with python and introductory classical physics and do prefer learning on my own. Then there is also the masters in data science by the same university) but that seems to be too competitive for a non-CS major to get into. Or is the data science field too saturated right now for non-CS majors?
 Thanks for reading this far and any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lots of organizations can benefit from ML but often struggle to find impactful projects. We wanted to share a simple but effective method for finding valuable applications that keep delivering value for our business: look for software rules that are already in production, but are suboptimal, and upgrade them with a ML solution.
 This approach guarantees that you will work on something needed for the business as the rules are already in use. It will also guarantee that you will create value with ML as you are focusing on going from a working solution to optimized solution. Delivering a ML solution that creates value is a great way to prove that ML is relevant to your business and that further investments should be made into it. We believe ML still has lots of potential to improve businesses and consumer experiences across industries.
 We wrote an article sharing a detailed example of this strategy that helped us to save thousands of orders from cancellation and make all sides of our marketplace happy. You can read about it here. Please leave comments below if you find this useful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have spent a good decade or so getting all the skills I can for Artificial Intelligence, completing a degree at university in the subject in 2020. My problem is I tend to focus a lot on community and relationship building online rather than money making. I find it hard to make money, find a job in this area etc... I thought with the recent popularity of certain products and such this might be a good time to ask. I am fed up of sitting round waiting for an opportunity or expecting one from someone. You can possibly call me an 'AI Expert' sitting around doing nothing in a sense. But I don't like using that term to describe myself. I am fed up of endless studying of the subject, there is only so much I can learn. I would even be willing to contribute to projects for free. 
 Basically, the advice I need, how do I make money or find a job in AI at the moment? 
 I know what you probably think, there must be tons of jobs in AI, probably, but they are a challenge to find, with most focusing on Data Science for one thing and many other reasons. Anyway I thought I would take my shot and ask at the moment whilst AI seems to be in the news a lot, I don't want to miss the opportunity. Note this is not really self promotion, I am actually genuinely asking the best way to at least start to find a job, e.g. good AI job websites etc... or apps I could make or something like this. I have never been good at being a business person so I find these kinds of things hard to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are several reasons why Microsoft may be better positioned to benefit from acquiring OpenAI than Google or any other competitors. Microsoft already has a collaboration and partnership deal with Open AI and has invested 1 billion dollars. Also, Microsoft has started using the GPT-3 in their products. One great example is Power Apps, which uses GPT-3 technology and helps to democratize the development experience by empowering developers who don't have coding experience. 
 Microsoft is a financially stable large organization, which means that it would have the abundant resources to fully build on top of what Open AI has created so far and also to commercialize the technology. Microsoft already has a sizable enterprise customer base, which could be advantageous. Existing products such as Windows, Office 365, Azure, Business Applications, which consist of D365 and Power Platform-related products, and LinkedIn will benefit from the use of advanced AI. Therefore, incorporating OpenAI's technology into these existing products could create significant value for Microsoft and help it edge ahead of the competition easily.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 I am/was a software dev.
 I have been 110% totally keen on the new AI products.
 Their potential is amazing.
 However, today I was reminded that there will be bad side effects.
 I discovered my wife crying - she has seen various high quality AI generated texts.
 She is an English language specialist .. and she can now see the role of creatives being replaced by software. What is the point of writing new books etc if a program can spit out something almost as good in seconds? My wife now feels that her skills and talent are now worthless.
 I can now understand why artists are so upset - the new image creation tools have essentially ruined their world too.
 We will soon end up with many people whose life skills & visions have suddenly been relegated to worthlessness.
 This situation will intensify as the AIs improve over the coming years.
 More and more domains i.e, people will be rendered of no value by the technology.
 I love the technology - but I think that humanity will pay heavily for its introduction as well as benefit from it.
 All that said, the genie is out of the bottle ... there is no going back.

For instance, I've read that in its early days, Netflix found that if a user rented out at least 3 DVDs, they were highly likely to continue with the service. Similarly with Uber, if a rider completed at least 2 rides, they were hooked. I'm trying to understand if there are any stats / ML techniques that can help me arrive at a similar answer for my company. We've taken an EDA approach, looking at the behavior of loyal customers in the first 30 days. But I'm hoping to understand if there are better ways to approach the problem

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the past 2 weeks or so I have used ChatGPT as a story teller for text based adventures but the last update ruined it. Now instead of properly describing a scene it gives very short descriptions, always forces the story and my character's actions towards good endings and keeps giving lectures about morality. I tell the AI I stumble upon a lamp and a genie comes out, giving me 3 wishes for freeing it. The AI writes 1 paragraph describing the lamp and the genie, 2 paragraphs writing about how these wishes won't affect anything in real life and this is not real... What the hell?! Why do they keep ruining the AI with every update. This last one literally lobotomized it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am so far only familar with basic CNN architecture (peeps an image, makes a classification). However, if an image has 2 objects (for example, my problem has two letters in a grid and i must identify them), I believe that basic CNN and softmax activation would fail. Is there a relatively simple way to build this type of model?
