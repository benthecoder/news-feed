I have done a little bit of research and I can't find any major cases of happening. I am currently doing research on the ethics and safety considerations of data collection in the context of machine learning. Any examples or help in general would be greatly appreciated!

I am running a project to identity the best channel for a promotional campaign. All the channels have have similar range of CTR. But using all channels for all customers is a cost to company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Since a lot of people appreciate the softer side of data science (based on my previous post, I am back with another 10 tips. 
 ​
 In most professional settings, it is not enough to be right.
 You have to be helpful.
 This means that you have to give more than just an answer. 
 You have to help your client understand where the answer is coming from.
 ​
 Note: A client can be a manager, colleague, or an actual paying client. 
 ​
 Here are 10 things that I learned:
 1. The client wants someone that will take away their worries and absorb problems.
 Be that person.
 2. Help the client understand why your analysis makes sense.
 Give them reasons.
 3. When presenting a recommendation, change statements into questions.
 “I would suggest X because of Y. Does this make sense to you?”
 4. When starting a new project, rephrase your client's problem to make sure you both understand each other.
 “So you think your customers are leaving because of bad customer service? Is that correct?”
 5. Before you can help someone, you have to understand what’s on their mind.
 Ask a lot of questions, shut up and listen.
 6. Don’t assume someone is a mind reader.
 Say what you think, but try to word it in a constructive way. Just saying that something is dumb is not helpful. Explain why the idea will not work, and come up with a new idea that you together can build upon.
 7. Take notes during meetings and review them before the next meeting.
 This will make sure there are no surprises.
 8. If you like working with someone, say it.
 It builds the relationship which helps in collaboration. Do this only if you mean it though.
 9. Almost everyone on every level in a serious profession feels imposter syndrome.
 Trust yourself; you know more than you do.
 10. The key to solving problems is curiosity.
 Focus on what you don’t know, instead of what you know and keep asking questions.
 ​
 I hope you found this useful and good luck with your projects!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 So, I am entering the research phase of my MSc in AI. The main body work work will be represented in a research paper, of around 8 pages. For the material that we could not/did not put into our paper, we are to submit what the department calls "supporting material". They do not specify what for this material can take.
 How would you gather and present this supporting material? Initially I am thinking about a github repo to present the project, with jupyter notebooks and the like, but I am interested in how others may do this.
 It seems previous people on the course have just written a longer report and submitted that, but that doesn't seem like a good way to show what you did.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To sharpen my stats for my job interviews next month, I'm trying test all kinds of things so it stays fresh in my brain. Video game ranks of myself vs the whole, how can I estimate a number I don't have access to?
 ​
 My own AC130 zombie target practice
 So I play that game 'Zombie Gunship' where you play the gunner in an AC130 Gunship, where you have the 105mm howitzer, 40mm grenade, and the 25mm gatling gun.
 The stats I want to estimate is if I am ranked 16,363 of 432,369 globally, I have 1107 kills, how can we estimate the top 1%, and how can we estimate the top player... in general.
 Ok, so I know these variables.
 Given:
 p=population = 432,369
 s=sampled rank 16,363 to 11,542
 n = 4,821 steps in rank
 r1 = 16,353 ~ 0.0378449889 or top 3.7% 
 r2 = 11,542 ~0.0266947908 or top 2.6%
 r3 = 1
 k1 = 1107
 k2 = 1178
 This is a two sample, known population, known proportion, and its ranked... which still doesn't solve for guessing the #1 players zombie kills. If we lowball the guess and say its linear how can we estimate it? Two sample proportion estimation formula here from our class. https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat800/lesson/5/5.5
 ​
 two sample formula
 The formula I'm thinking is phat-p0 divided by sqroot of ( p0(1-p0))/n or 0.037844-0.026694 = 0.01115 which matches the same proportion of 4821/432,369 = 0.0111501.
 So 0.01115/sqrt(0.026694(1-0.026694)) then divide that by 4821 which gives me a z=4.8029. That sort of makes sense it would be four times the std deviation but we don't know what the distribution of total kills are so k1 and k2 are nice to have but useless unless I went into python to code up some linear estimator. So its maybe accurate math but doesn't fit the distribution.
 So what are the other options to estimate this?
 I can click the app and have it tell me what the top players stats are but I want to guess.

Now after a week, when I checked about the update, they told me that due to restructure in the company, hiring process slowed down a bit and it would take a month for the recruitment process to start! 
 IS this common or my profile got kicked out?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi community!
 Work in a field with lots of machinery where pumps and compressors reliability has direct impact on the bottomline. See a lot of new companies coming to offer the holy grail in terms of predictive maintenance using "analytics", but they are seldom able to live up to expectations or can't simply provide tangible evidence to go for a trial. We also have an internal Data Science team testing published methods, replicating work from other companies, etc and results are more or less the same: when applied to real data, nothing really adds value over properly performed condition monitoring (*). Then read plenty of academic articles (like this example https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/1/291/pdf?version=1640946584) where their conclusions seem to match ours (methods work nicely on perfect synthetic data, but fall sort in real life production).
 Data-wise, we could always ask for more instruments to be installed, but we have a reasonable amount of history on key performance variables. Vibration sensors are not installed on every pump/compressor, but where we have them (in really critical machines) it doesn't really make a difference. 
 So, not to sound like I'm just whining, anyone out there really succeeding in the subject of applying ML methods to predict equipment failures well in advance?
 (*) Some companies come showing "success stories" where instrumenting and monitoring a key temperature "helped the operator save millions of dollars". That's not what I'm referring to; in my book that's not ML-enabled predictive maintenance...that's basic condition monitoring not being done in first place.

 To understand how to secure IoT systems, it’s essential to explore potential cybersecurity risks first. Here’s a list of common security challenges with the Internet of Things.
 1. Software and firmware vulnerabilities
 Ensuring the security of IoT systems is tricky, mostly because a lot of smart devices are resource-constrained and have limited computing power. Thus, they can’t run powerful, resource-hungry security functions and are likely to have more vulnerabilities than non-IoT devices.
 Many IoT systems have security vulnerabilities for the followin…]]></summary>

 Hope you are all doing well.
 I have a platform that brings together freelance data scientists with companies. In order to generate more traffic on the online platform (on the company's side), I am looking for an e-commerce case study. This case should answer questions like:
  
How to improve the acquisition of customers with data science?
 How to improve the retention of customers with data science?
  
But companies are kinda scared, of sharing this sort of data. How would you approach this challenge?

 In the modern world, artificial intelligence is the way to go. There have been AI for a while now. In order to build "intelligent machines," or devices that might mimic the cognitive abilities of the human brain, such as comprehension and problem-solving, AI was first put up as a field of study in computer science in 1955. Banks may utilise artificial intelligence and machine learning to process large amounts of data quickly and gain insightful information.
 Additionally, technology like biometric fraud detection systems, contactless banking, and AI bots can provide higher-quality services to a wider range of customers. Artificial intelligence is exemplified by technologie…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Big) part of my data-science job is helping colleagues with insights from various datasets. Most of the times this comes in the form of reports, but now and then I also create dashboards (PowerBI or Shiny).
 The problem is that so far those have been very ad-hoc. A colleague would approach me with a question and I would whip up a quick and easy solution in PowerBI to help them.
 The "problem" is that this has raised awareness and more and more people are asking for dashboards. I always filter the ones that could also just make do with a simple report (90% of the cases).
 The real problem though is that my manager, knowing there have been several dashboards in the past, will now approach me with something like: "You developed a dashboard for X, could you update it with the new data and show Y how to use it".
 What I want to do is start working with a formal project management framework when developing a new dashboard for internal clients. So I would like to set up questions/requirements upfront and have clear deals on who is going to be using it, how much time maintenance takes, etc... 
 Since my solutions have been very ad-hoc so far, what I am asking is, does anyone have any tips on how to set up projects like that. I want things to be documented and clearly agreed upon. Any templates/ideas for this would help me a lot. 
 Thank you all in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently started working at a graduate position but I'm starting to feel self concious about how long I take to get things moving.
 It's at a manufactoring plant with lots of internal departments and machinery and it did take a good 3 months to understand what each section is doing, however, I've been given a task to find some key drivers that are causing increased consumption and it's taken me ages for close to no progress.
 I have now got a backlog of projects from other departments and I'm not really sure how to properly prioritise and how much time should be dedicated towards a project before jumping onto something new/shifting projects. I don't really wanna half ass it but I'm unsure if me chasing perfection is hindering me and I should just let things lie as is ?
 Any pointers appreciated 🫠
