        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are numerous amazing AI-powered software/programs available, such as Wave2Lip on GitHub (which enables you to lip sync a video to any voice audio file), CascadeOur (which generates AI animations), or Google Film (which creates a seamless slow-motion effect from two distant frames). These programs possess tremendous potential, but how can I discover new ones? I'm sure there are many more out there that I am not aware of. Can you suggest any tips on how I can find them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to create a predictive model that will be built on individual data, but user input will only exist at the group level. Reasoning is that I have 5 million rows of data at the individual level, but only 100 companies exist in that data.
 For example: I want to calculate the % increase in earnings an investment firm earns year over year.
 My Level 1 data would contain fields such as: Analyst_Id, Company_Name, Age, Earnings_2019, Earnings_2020, Level_of_Education, Company_region, Number_of_Trades
 I can use this data to calculate characteristics for each Company_Name: Total_Earnings_2019, Average Investor Age, Average number of trades made, and company region.
 The results should be interpreted at the Company level - ie, the user can input a company's average age, region, and average level of education and the output will be a predicted earnings trend for a company with those characteristics.
 I've been looking into Multilevel modeling / hierarchical lineal models / nested data structures, but these techniques appear to combine individual & group level variables in the final model, whereas I would be building a model that only has group characteristics.
 Which modeling techniques would make sense for this scenario?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, if this is the incorrect sub to post on, I do apologize. I don't come from a CS related background and am currently in a data science post graduate program. I fully recognize that I'll feel inadequate to get a job in the field after a 6 month program, I know. However, I took it as an introduction and am looking at other educational tools after this that could help me become more competent and ready for a job after this. I've also been thinking about taking a year or so working as a data _analyst_ to get some sort of experience then upskill and upgrade to a data _scientist_. Does that make sense? Or should I finish this program I'm doing and immediately jump into something like a master's program for data science? If that's a bad idea, let me know. I'm currently looking at the one online from U of Colorado Boulder. As you can see, I'm a little lost and feel like I'm in over my head. Maybe I am! Anyway, thanks for any comments, concerns, or advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once upon a time, in the Hundred Acre Wood, Winnie the Pooh was feeling down in the dumps. All of his friends were busy with their own activities and he was feeling left out. Pooh decided to take a walk and ended up stumbling upon a mysterious honey pot that had "BB" written on it.
 Curious, Pooh started to investigate and discovered that the honey pot was actually a cover for a hidden laboratory run by a character similar to Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad. The character was cooking up a batch of special honey, which Pooh was immediately drawn to.
 Despite the character's warnings, Pooh couldn't resist the delicious aroma and sneaked a taste. He was shocked to find that the honey was not only the sweetest he had ever tasted, but it also gave him a burst of energy and focus that he had never experienced before.
 Intrigued, Pooh started to spend more time with the character, helping him with his honey making and learning about the science behind it. Pooh soon discovered that the character was using the honey to pay for his granddaughter's medical treatment, just like in Breaking Bad.
 Pooh felt a sense of camaraderie with the character and wanted to help. Together, they came up with a plan to create a legitimate business selling the special honey, but with a focus on using the profits to help others in need.
 As their business grew, so did their friendship. Pooh was no longer feeling left out, as he was now a part of something important and fulfilling. The two worked together, using their newfound skills and knowledge, to bring joy and happiness to the residents of the Hundred Acre Wood.
 And so, Winnie the Pooh and his friend from Breaking Bad lived happily ever after, spreading the sweet nectar of kindness and generosity to all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Gaussian Naive Bayes model. 90% of all data identified as positive are true positives, and 56% of all data identified as negative are true negatives. This is approximately true when evaluating the model both against the train dataset and the test dataset I generated (which I suspect is actually a cross-validation dataset, as this is a Kaggle competiton so the actual "test" dataset doesn't have the Y variable.)
 In all, the accuracy is about 60%.
 However, I'd like to investigate that true-negative rate and see why it's so low and what I can do to improve it.
 As this is a Kaggle competition, I'm not sure if the Terms of Service allow me to reveal what Kaggle competition I am talking about.
 Thoughts?

 Would an API (REST, RPC) to my server be a sufficient interface, or do most customers expect a different user interface, like a UI?
 Would I give each customer a different key to use when calling the API to give them access to the service?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to predict sales for a tea export company with different tea types and weights. My goal is to predict sales for each product type category for the next 12 months.
 Data set looked like this
 Date Type Weight Quantity Price 2016-01-01 black bags 1734136.51 1131.30 2016-01-01 black bulk 10722389.66 510.86 2016-01-01 black 4g_1kg 6817078.01 588.72 2016-01-01 black 1kg_3kg 86444.50 565.91 2016-01-01 black 3kg_5kg 1003986.73 552.39 
 I have simply predicted the total sales and that came out pretty good. But I don't understand how to predict sales for each type and weight classes. I understand the time is valuable and if someone can explain me the way to do it, it would be great. I'm trying to use linear regression for this. Accuracy doesn't matter. What I want to understand is to feed the data and get the output for different product variations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I recently finished my PhD in physics (in France), where I did a lot experimental data analysis in Python, and also worked with particle Monte Carlo simulations in C++ including parallel programming. This was in the context of plasma physics. After the PhD I worked for a few months in a large video game company developing some frameworks in C++, but I quit since the project wasn't so interesting in the end and I was afraid of being stuck in there for a long time. Right now I am back to my old lab with a temporary research contract. 
 I would like to leave academia and have a more stable and compelling job with a nice salary, so I was considering going to Data Science since I think it's something that really suits me given my background, but I am a bit hesitant due to the number of people I read saying it's quite a competitive field to enter right now. Another option would be to go to something like mobile/web dev, but I feel that it would be less interesting. 
 I see a lot of people telling how to start in the DS field, by making a portfolio, etc. But I am not exactly sure what would be the best approach in my case. What would be the best strategy in your opinion? Do you think DS is still a field where someone with my profile is needed? 
 Thanks in advance! :)

 What has your experience been with taking higher ed classes and work full time? From what I’m assuming there won’t be much free time of course but the pay off is worth it. I’m looking at some data science/analytics program or MBA (leaning more towards data science) but want to gauge how intense it is and is the end result worth the investment.

 But from this post, I wish to gain a holistic view on what you all have pursued after landing a job related to DS. 
 Do you go for: • MBA for a managerial role • MOOC courses on different DS tools to stay updated • Certification in MLOPS/Dashboard/statistical programming etc. • PG in economics, quantitative finance, statistics etc.
 I understand people chose to pursue topics they wish to accomplish in their careers. 
 But I wish to gain a quantitative insight into what most DS pursue after landing a job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a simple supply chain analysis that I'm hoping to get some feedback on. I'm wanting to build an analysis that shows a negative correlation between inbound service and outbound transportation costs. The theory is that when our incoming shipments are delayed, we need to expedite outbound shipments to pick up the slack. Thus incurring additional cost.
 I built a simple linear regression model that plots item ID on a graph that has service level % on x-axis and transportation cost on the y-axis. This was strait forward. Now I want to build a similar graph that shows the sum total of our transportation spend on the y-axis. This would demonstrate that with each percent increase in overall inbound service level, we can decrease overall transportation costs by X.
 My questions are:
  
Is it mathematically correct to translate the first analysis into the second?
 How would I go about building the second graph based on the first analysis? (included sample data below for illustration)

 Hello, I have a question, now it is much easier to transcribe a video with artificial intelligence and then import to Premiere or Vegas to create subtitles inserted in the video image itself, but can you think of a way to convert that same text to artificial voice and create audio file or track with the same timecode or just sync with the original video?
 It could be done with any text-to-speech converter, but then you would have to manually cut and wrap each piece of text.
 Example: 
 1 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520 In this space we like to feel a bit of everything,
 2 00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,600 but the important thing is to make dance.
 3 00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,680 A task performed by all digiles
 4 00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:12,160 and one who has been doing this since the 80s is the maestro Maik
 5 00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,240 Good evening Maik.

We heard from a lot of people that the biggest thing holding them back from starting a company was that they didn't want to do it alone and didn't have any friends who wanted to do it with them.
So we built a site that's similar to a dating site but for co-founders, and launched it on HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27750298.
Like any new product, we weren't sure how well this would work.  Other people had tried this idea before, and none of them had really taken off.  But we thought YC had some unique advantages in doing it.
Fast forward to now, and frankly it's worked better than we dared hope.  In the first two years, YC has invested in dozens of companies that came from people meeting each other on the s…]]></summary>

I have not seen much of anything online about Merrimack so I’m hoping to hear some reviews of this program. I’m thinking of Merrimack & Eastern University as my backups in case I don’t get accepted into Georgia Tech. Anyone have any insights? Thanks.

 I got an invitation to a second interview for a Data Analyst position. For the interview they want me to present a case study for which they have provided a csv, my question is what is expected of me?
 The csv is a customer satisfaction survey with columns regarding: "How easy was it to handle the matter?", "Did you receive the help you expected?", "How satisfied are you with the recieved service?" and "How likely are you to recommend us to someone you know?"
 During the first interview they discussed data visualisation alot so I feel like that is at least expected of me. Any general points of directions what visualisation and analysis that is probably expected would help alot since this is the first time I've gotten this far in the interviewing process.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been self-studying gaussian processes; watching videos, reading papers and blogs, and started with the Rasmussen & Williams book. I’m still quite a way from fully grasping it.
 Now, gaussian processes is a non-parametric model, requiring access to all the training data when making predictions. I’m often coming across the information that GPs don’t require cross-validation. How then can one confidently assess the model? Especially with regards to higher dimensions, when you can not visualize it as a plot.
 As a side not, although I am trying my best to understand the math, I am using scikit-learn.

 I'm only working toward the multi layer ANN, I don't want to tackle with others like CNN, RNN, LSTM, Transformers and so on, for the moment being.
 From my own research I have figured a few, which are:
  
Momentum based optimizers for saddle point problem
 batch, mini-batch and stochastic gradient descent
 batch normalization
 L1, L2 regularization 
 dropouts
  
Can you tell me what other techniques available?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data for non science background people
 Hi everyone, i come from a finance background and want to move into data. I'm not sure whether I should start with data analysi, data science, data engineering, BI, etc. So many things out there which makes it equally confusing for me to choose from. I don't know if data even is for me. At the same time i don't want to just sit idle till i come to a decision. What would you suggest i start with atleast so that i can figure out the process as i go? 
 I'm a qualified CMA and have experience in accounts and costing, zero idea of data science and don't know where/how to start.
