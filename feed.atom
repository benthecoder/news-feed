        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I'm working in a startup and I'm running a lot of reports and do data cleanup / wrangling for finance reports. Most of my work I do in python and some Excel here and there.
 That's all fine, but the next evolution is that I want to build systems in which I don't have to run the reports for my colleagues but build some sort of system / UI that makes it easy for them to run their own reports.
 The data flow is not very complex but also not very easy to understand for novices. We have a lot of 3rd party csv files that need to be manipulated, merged and formed into reports.
 My colleagues are tech illiterate. So installing python on their laptops and letting them run scripts is too complex. Writing a UI in python and letting them run self coded .exe files is prevented by IT department of the holding our startup is connected to. 
 So I'm searching for a soulution that has a) great data manipulation capability and b) is capable of building nice UI capabilities
 ​
 A typical task looks like this:
  
Download one or more .csv files from a 3rd party tool
 Data Cleanup
 Match the data to entries in our database
 Create various pivot tables
 Loop through the user database and create PDF reports for each user
  
​
 I tried building most tools in excel, but boy do I hate this program. I mean... for easy data manipulation and visualisation it's fine, but there's a lot of issues when you start writing a lot of UI
 I thought about PowerBI - does anyone have experience with it? Looks great for even more complex reports, Tableau would also work
 That's a first time I have to choose the infrastructure, so I'd love to hear your opinions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I get stressed out a lot by my work. The people, and the lack of autonomy.
It invades my evenings, my nights, I spend sometimes hours unable to sleep dreading the next day.
I don't have any autonomy. I'm treated as a resource to be "used". And I work with people I don't respect personally or professionally.
I have been looking for a way out for a while, but let's just say that quitting or finding another job is NOT an option for now, for the sake of argument - to hopefully get some actionable advice.
I already stopped caring about my work. But my personality finds it difficult to ignore things that are wrong. Sometimes I look at other colleagues communication with others and it affects me also, I see so much wrong but I can't do anything about it.
How can I just stop caring?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Often I see people post about how most of their time is spent on SQL. 
 What % of time do you spend on repeatable / simple SQL? 
 Complex queries / something you are doing for a deep dive can be ignored (consider this part of core work) 
 I’ll go first, when I was in an individual contributor role this would be 30-40%
 EDIT: by repeatable I mean queries that are simple and don’t vary much. For example, orders by day, week, month or retention by day, week, month. Basically queries that are straightforward but you HAVE to do cause other folks don’t know SQL

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a dataset like this, a bunch of employees’s data over a period of time say daily or monthly over a year. The metrics are employee atrributes say how much occupied the employee is each time frame, how engaged he is with his team in terms of percentage, how much absent he was from work etc… all these are already available measures.
 I also have some employees data who have attrited voluntarily. What I need to do is to predict who all would be the future employees that would potentially resign based on the metrics captured over a period of time.
 Which model should be ideal to begin with. Its would be a potential binary classification problem. So the output will be for existing employees 1 or 0 based on the time series metrics of his past datapoints based on the assumption of the already attrited employees with similar metrics.

 I have an engineering degree (graduated in 2005) but have always been on the management side until after my MBA. Post-MBA, I had my first Analytics role in FedEx in Pricing Analytics and I really enjoyed my time there. I had to leave my job as I was diagnosed with a chronic illness and haven't been able to hold down a job in the last five years.
 During this time, I tried to bolster my foundation in programming, stats, and math through online courses but it feels quite shallow to me. I was admitted for a Master's program in Analytics in 2020 and I have been deferring it because every time I feel what I know in the areas I mentioned is inadequate.
 tl;dr: I am looking for book recommendations (or any other resources you can think of) to make my foundations stronger in Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability and Statistics. I have a fair bit of an idea about what courses to take for SQL/Python/R/Tableau but if you have any suggestions there, that would be great too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I work for a company that has limited data. We are a manufacturing company with 4000 different items. The cycle time here ranges between 7 and 90 days (on average 3 weeks). There are different product groups with production lines.
 We have various challenges which cause individual orders ( 1 item per order) to be delayed. These are manufacturing, assembly, and packaging processes including times when items have to rest for a certain time.
 Now I would like to determine per order - when a process has been started or completed late - which remaining cycle time is still to be expected.
 I have the following historical data (2 years) in a simple form:
  
 Item Process Start End 
  
 IK100 1 01.01.2022 02.02.2022 
  IK100 2 04.01.2022 06.01.2022 
 
 Based on past performance, I would now like to determine what the expected time is. 
 ​
  
What would be the best way to do this? 
 So what basic steps are necessary now?
  
​
 I have some knowledge of statistics and simulation, just need to brush up on it. 
 I am grateful for any tip, blog, book

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All,
 I'm starting a masters in CS (OMSCS) this upcoming January with the goal of prepping myself for data science. I’m looking to bring my stats knowledge up to par to understand texts like Deep Learning- Goodfellow, PRML, ML A Probabilistic Perspective, etc. 
 My background is civil engineering and in undergrad took Calc 1-3, Diff Eq, Linear Algebra and a non-calc based stats 101 type class. When I got my masters in Civil-Transportation I took some stats modeling classes that covered regression (linear, logistic, poisson, negative binomial, etc) pretty heavily using R+NLOGIT.
 At this point my stats knowledge is pretty disjointed and feel like I dont have a solid understanding of the fundamentals. From what I can tell with some research the most popular recommendations I've seen are:
  
Statistical Inference- at first glance this book feels way above my level, like I can probably work out some things with effort, but I'll probably need another book to fill in the gaps.
 All of Statistics- Looks solid as a reference for someone who's taken way more stats than I have, super concise but super dry read.
 Mathematical Statistics with Applications(Wackerly)- This is one that feels like could be a possibility
 Introduction to Probability(Blitz)- This feels like the other contender
  
So far books 3 and 4 seem like best options, is there anything else I'm missing or votes one way or another?
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love the new text to image generators, I think it's amazing. I love scifi and stuff as well it all got me thinking about where this is headed and I wanted to know how long it may realistically take till we get there. I could see a world where you could feed a neural network all the episodes of Seinfeld and it could give you an infinite number of new episodes, all rendered in photo realistic detail. Could be any show, King of Queens, Everybody Loves Raymond, Family Guy, Community. 
 You could also have an ai write and generate shows based on current trends with no input from human beings. All the voice work and acting would he generated. Then the show could morph and change in real time based on reception and feedback. 
 So how long until those things are realistically possible, or at least close? I know we already have some video generators but they aren't very good. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I’m currently working as a data scientist with a undergrad background in Economics with a minor in data science
 I am planning to pursue a masters in the future and am unsure which master (Comp Sci, Business Analytics, Stats or Data science) would better suit me and benefit me the most. 
 I feel that I am neither here or there in both CS Or Stats. Also, if possible, I would like to try out different roles in the data science branch (MLOps, Data Engineer etc). Let me know your thoughts! Thanks in advance

 I tried with sentiment analysis but it’s not good enough, since the book goes basically like:
 Man is about to meet an old friend -> he finds out he died -> friend wakes up from the coma and is alive -> he’s an impostor and the actual friend did die. 
 Any other ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I only have about a year of working experience as a data scientist so far and a relevant graduate degree and have been more open to opportunities in the US than I was in my previous field. Some colleagues always mention to me that I could always find some work in the US for DS since they are always looking for DS talent. People in the field I've talked to always mention that because I'm young and don't have a family to worry about, I should consider working abroad. I currently reside in Canada and have always wondered about the degree of difficulty it would be to get a job below the border as a Data scientist. Are companies in the US generally open to Canadian talent since getting a work visa is much easier than workers from other countries? Or are US companies who are in need of DS talent averse to foreign talent irrespective of their origin?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have inherited a project of maintaining and improving a large regression model. To sum it up, it's a neural net that's trained on huge amounts of historical data (millions of records with 1000+ data points) and with several regression outputs. It's not a time series model, although time (date) is one of the data points. The way it's structered, every week the data is updated with the most recent data and I transfer the weights from the latest model and continue training. However, I find it very difficult to evaluate this model if I want to introduce changes or additional data points because of the weights that are being transferred and the size of the model and the time it needs to train. Additionally, it's very resource intensive so it's difficult to train in parallel and see how the output is affected. All in all, any tips on how to make this process more friendly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a little context, my academic background is a BS in math with a minor in Computer Science.
 I was having my weekly one on one with my thesis advisor for my master’s program (in industrial engineering) and he was telling me what courses I needed to take next semester in the event that I do wish to pursue a PhD (which is eventually what I plan on doing). He asked me if I wanted to go into teaching and I told him no but that I had thought about being an adjunct eventually, but that it was not my overall goal, and he said that my reasons for doing a PhD were more unclear if I didn’t want to teach. He’s constantly telling me that I have the ideal background for data science/operations research type positions in whatever industry because of my background and work experience (currently working as a data analyst and a research assistant), however, I’m only using these positions as a stepping stone. My actual overall end goal is to end up working in healthcare in a data science roll, and I’ve seen that typically at the entry level I meet the minimum requirements, but if I seek advancement for a lead researcher/lead data scientist position a PhD is really almost necessary.
 Aside from that I really enjoy learning and have thirst for being a pioneer/researcher in the field and with my undergrad I really didn’t feel like I delved enough into the topics I was interested in, which is partly why I wanted to pursue an advanced degree, but even now getting my masters and being halfway through I still feel like I still don’t delve enough into the material, which is another reason why I want to do my PhD.
 So, are my reasons that unclear? Or am I probably not conveying this information enough to my advisor?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a full-stack web developer with a few years of experience, but I would like to switch to data science in my company. The problem is, besides programming, math is required. I did not do it for 5 years now, but always liked it and been good at it. It would not be a problem I guess to learn it. My question is, how should I start? I need a roadmap. I want to start from the beginning. Any suggestions for books, courses, etc?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dall E 2 and it's image generation competitors like midjourney and stable diffusion really opened my eyes and made me feel like ai is coming faster then expected. 
 Maybe it's because I am more interested in the creative field but I havent heard much about ai in other fields... Having a program that can generate images just by describing them in any style I want is cool but it's not something I think anyone really needs and it will just take jobs away from artists in an already precarious industry with excessive supply.
 Now why isn't Ai creation being focused on making the stuff most of us human need but don't enjoy doing. That's what tools are for aren't they? 
 Why can't AI do a business plan, take care of taxes or manage finances, reply to boring work emails, write me a report, make a website, organize my calendar, diagnose me when I feel sick etc
 I feel like the creative fields are some of the last that need to be automated since alot of people enjoy the process of creation even more then the results and almost no one is crying out for AI to come and save art.
 In a utopia ai would be used to automate all the parts of work that we don't enjoy but are necessary so we could all focus on doing what we love.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little background at me: I am about to graduate with my degree in statistics within the next month. I am looking to start applying to entry level data science roles at the beginning of the new year. In my degree, I took a machine learning, data mining and deep learning class on top of my statistics coursework. 
 The issue I have is, during this coursework, most of our assignments consisted of smaller datasets in lower dimensions. I know in the real world I’ll have datasets that may consist of 100s to 1000s of predictors as well GBs to TBs of memory. Im not sure where I can find exposure to datasets as large to practice with. Also, I’m not sure what techniques I can use for proper feature selection. Im aware that to look through and remove any predictors that aren’t relevant to the problem. Also, we can remove any predictors that have 0 variance. After that, I’m a bit stumped on where to go. I know creating plots/ histograms of each predictor will be very time consuming. I know this is one of the most crucial steps in the process so I want to make sure I strengthen this skill. So I guess, in summary here are my questions:
  
Where can I find large datasets to practice? (I love kaggle for smaller datasets but it doesn’t seem to have many in large dimensions)
 
What are some techniques or skills I can use for feature selection? Are there any resources I can read to learn? Books/articles/papers/etc.
 
 Thanks in advance and I’m sorry if this has already been asked… I’m having trouble finding a post.

 With the rise of Artificial Intelligence in the last couple of years, AI writing and AI imagery have become quite common nowadays. Multiple companies and software like such have successfully integrated AI into their products because AI is definitely making work faster and sometimes even better than people in a lot of cases. So my question is, what is stopping companies from implementing AI in web design?
 Apologies if the question seems naive. I'm neither a design expert nor an AI expert. Just a student who was exploring these fields. 
 So I was wondering whether AI can boost their design industry in Web development. Can't AI be used to improve landing pages or even create them? If AI text writing, AI painting and AI illustrations software are all readily available, how hard will it be to implement the same concept for web designing?
 TIA for the insight!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So it looks like this sub has converged to a shared realisation that most DS jobs these days are just glorified BI Analyst roles. All these years I was super stressed that I was somehow incredibly unlucky in how I picked DS jobs, but now I can see that being a SQL monkey is actually the norm. Good.
 I can also understand the sentiment of those who are happy to stay in their boring but overpaid DS / BI jobs with 200k+ TC. But this is not why I made the switch into DS a few years ago - if anything, I was looking for a more exciting technical challenge after a couple of years in a pretty mundane SWE job.
 To those stuck in "BI" data science roles but keen to grow - what's your way of giving your brain cells some intellectual stimulation before your job makes you too dumb? Do you still manage to somehow dedicate, say, 20% of your time to something actually interesting? Or is it side projects? Or something else?
 Generally speaking, any pro tips to find joy in Data Science again after years of being a SQL monkey?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I had previously set up my home server with SSH on a high port, and did the port forwarding thing on the firewall so that I can SSH into this system from elsewhere on the Internet.  It worked fine for months.
And then, it stopped working. The router didn’t have a software update as far as I can see. I re-checked everything, but I just can’t initiate a connection to the server from elsewhere on the Internet. It seems like it is filtered somewhere in the ISP’s network.  I can, and possibly will switch ISPs, but in the mean time, I’m looking at other technical options. Though we use the other main ISP for work, and their uptime in the last couple years has been… less than stellar.
One option is obviously rent a VPS, and set up a VPN or something, and have the home server connect to that at startup.  I can and have done that in the past, but even a low-cost VPS is $10 USD per month.
Some of the VPN providers out there have relatively low-cost multi-year deals, so I was looking at one of those. But it wasn’t clear if any of them supported what I wanted to do. I don’t really need to watch Netflix from a different region, I just want access to my server remotely.
I just wanted to see if anyone else is doing something like this.  Thanks!]]></summary>
