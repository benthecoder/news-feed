So, when I first saw this story, I wanted to get Hawaii's porn consumption data and use the synthetic control method to construct Synthetic Hawaii (i.e., if the missile alert didn't happen) from the other 50ish American states and territories. Does anyone happen to have experience using PH's data, or know where I might get it from? Ideally I'd want minute by minute (or hour by hour) data, but I don't know where I'd even go. Google Analytics? Or should I just try and email their insights team directly?

Did construction, real estate, grew weed in Denver for a year (legally), ended up bartending for roughly a decade.  It was great in my early 20s.

 From my networking and research, it seems data science interviews do not really focus on leetcode. Rather the focus is: - strong understanding of conceptual ML, statistics - ability to code in SQL to pull data (huge importance) - ability to code in Python/R to create models - genuine curiosity and drive to get answers. - Ability to frame and understand the business problem 
 I’m currently doing a masters in analytics and after a series of SQL, Python, Machine Learning and Statistics courses I have a decent grasp of everything above. I am far from an expert coder and don’t generally have coding memorized from the top of my head - I do require the internet. However, I have a decent ability to use code to perform data engineering, data cleaning, data visualization, data modelling. Just not at a level of a computer science student for example. 
 But my worry is mainly that if I get handed an algorithm leetcode type question in an interview for Data Science, I’ll fail. So wanted to understand people’s opinion on this as I am a soon to be graduating and am looking for a job in data science.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know there’s no hard and fast rule, but what is considered a good timeframe for PhD students entering industry to begin sending applications? I do data science in agriculture and am hoping to get a DS role at an AgTech company.
 I graduate in late May/early June and have been applying to DS positions in my domain since December. I’m aware that there are a lot of factors at play, but I’m getting quickly rejected for positions that fit right into my area of exercise and that I feel highly qualified for.
 Assuming that other elements, like my CV, cover letter, LinkedIn, etc, are strong, am I simply applying too early? Is there a chance that a company would be interested in me, or am I misusing my time at this point by applying now? If so, when should I realistically expect for graduation date to not be an issue?
 Thanks in advance for any thoughts here!

 Imagine if you draw lines between the players of the home and away team separately. 
 How would you do that and with what code? 
 How would you measure the space when lines are drawn in triangles within the teams.
 So imagine using the video in the link (for example): https://youtu.be/9ALZ5Wjy22Y
 Thinking about creating this data and selling it to football clubs so they could see which players are disturbing space covering per positions. 
 Happy hearing your thoughts!

Majority of my courses are Statistics related. I am taking data-related courses and trying to land an internships right now. Almost, all of my courses are taught in R.
 I just do not know the begining of the road map in the field. I know that my program combination is ideal for Data Analyst/Analytics jobs. However, I need your recommendations on how to build up my skills. 
 I am planning to take online Python and SQL courses and do some projects to learn and put on my resume. Is there any advice you can give me on that? Such as which online resources should I start with and what projects should I do and put on my resume as an undergrad student. 
 Is my degree suitable enough for this path? 
 Any recommendation would be appreciated! Thank you so much!

I was confident in my ability to identify what factors to include in the system, how to validate it, how to create actionable insights and communicate to nontechnical stakeholders. But where I got tripped up were some of the technical questions, mostly because I never had the experience. Should I have been expected to:
  
Answer how to create a new ETL process? That feels more like a Data Engineer/System question which was not stated anywhere in the job description.
 Optimize SQL statements? I know SQL and how to use it, but the majority of my work is with Tableau and pulling in extra data sources as needed. 
 Answer how I would create a database? I built a very small database with mySQL back in undergrad, but that's the last time that I personally built a database. I've always relied on whatever vendor the institution had a contract with.
  
I know the definition of data scientist varies, but I was just curious if I should brush up on things like this should another data scientist role in higher education come my way...
 Here were the posted duties/responsibilities for context:
  
Collaborate with stakeholders on data management best practices, ethics, privacy, research, and use of data
 Design and implement data processing techniques for large datasets using a future data warehouse in consultation with campus partners
 Coordinate efforts to collect, clean, analyze, and document data and management processes
 Analyze data to generate actionable insights 
 Communicate insights through visualizations/presentations
 Advocate for data privacy, ethics, and equity

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The demise of Moore’s Law has led to the rise of hardware acceleration. However, the focus on accelerating stable algorithms in their entirety neglects the abundant fine-grained acceleration opportunities available in broader domains and squanders host processors’ compute power. This paper presents Duet, a scalable, manycore-FPGA architecture that promotes embedded FPGAs (eFPGA) to be equal peers with processors through non-intrusive, bi-directionally cache-coherent integration. In contrast to existing CPU-FPGA hybrid systems in which the processors play a supportive role, Duet unleashes the full potential of both the processors and the eFPGAs with two classes of post-fabrication enhancements: fine-grained acceleration, which partitions an application into small tasks and offloads the frequently-invoked, compute-intensive ones onto various small accelerators, leveraging the processors to handle dynamic control flow and less accelerable tasks; hardware augmentation, which employs eFPGA-emulated hardware widgets to improve processor efficiency or mitigate software overheads in certain execution models. An RTL-level implementation of Duet is developed to evaluate the architecture with high fidelity. Experiments using synthetic benchmarks show that Duet can reduce the processor-accelerator communication latency by up to 82% and increase the bandwidth by up to 9.5x. The RTL implementation is further evaluated with seven application benchmarks, achieving 1.5-24.9x speedup.

Despite this, the construction of lattices and use of lattice reduction algorithms for cryptanalysis continue to be somewhat difficult to understand for beginners. This tutorial aims to be a gentle but detailed introduction to lattice-based cryptanalysis targeted towards the novice cryptanalyst with little to no background in lattices. We explain some popular attacks through a conceptual model that simplifies the various components of a lattice attack.

I haven’t been really in the weeds on analysis for a number of years now, and I don’t know what I could do that would still have a good 6-figure salary but more of an individual contributor with maybe mentoring instead of managing. I’m definitely up for learning skills like SQL and Python, but would really like to make a move soon. Maybe I’m being unrealistic, but my current job is killing me and I need to make a change but am feeling lost about options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am getting more and more requests from my students asking if they should go into data fields X, Y, and Z. There's a lot of personal preference here. Still, I would like to give them a data-driven way to say the market is hot for data engineers but less for data scientists and openings for data engineers have increased over the past year wrt all job openings. I checked Indeed and LinkedIn jobs - none of these websites seem to have a service that offers career advice based on current job offerings and trending. I am sure that must exist somewhere. Anyone?

 Thanks a bunch!

 Microsoft has dominated BIG TECH headlines over the last few months, thanks largely to a drumbeat of headlines involving their partner OpenAI and its world-shaping ChatGPT. 
 So awe-striking is Microsoft's hand right now, it has made rival companies' advancements, like Apple's recently announced and insanely powerful M2 MacBook Pros, look pedestrian in comparison. 
 But now Google has entered the chat. 
 And by "entered the chat", we mean that CEO Sundar Pichai - Pich-AI? - released a distressingly long 15,000-word(!) treatise on its own endeavors in AI, signaling a counter attack... maybe... at some point in the future... when and if it…]]></summary>

I thought maybe I could ask on Reddit first to see what's the most recommended and check them out from here. I want to share my code output with non-tech team members, and oftentimes we end up sharing screenshots through Slack. This also happens when I want to ask someone about a bug on a particular block code. Right now, we are just looking for a notebook that works well for sharing + collaboration both in the notebook as well as through Slack mainly.

 And Ive been wondering what program these might be using, and if its open to the public. If not is there any program that any of you might suggest to achieve identical if not similar results as I have a few ideas on how this could be utilised within a game engine and animation workspace
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 Mid level data scientist here very interested in learning more about ETL. I’m fluent in both R and Python, but I have no interest in SAS for many of the reasons that have been discussed here previously. 
 I recently joined a company that needed some help with both basic analytical insights, but also needed to build out robust ETL pipelines. I was excited about this opportunity as I really want to learn more about ETL and the entire process of curating high quality data. 
 During the interview process they indicated they were on a relatively modern ETL stack (Apache Airflow, DBT, in the process of integrating Great Expectations, etc.) so I was really excited to learn!
 Fast forward to about a couple of months in - everything in the ETL pipeline (99%+) is in SAS. I feel like I got tricked!
 I have no interest in working in the traditional SAS industries (insurance, banking, etc.) and I know that convincing them to move to python is a hopeless endeavor. 
 The WLB is crazy good, the pay is mediocre, and I know I won’t develop here. Should I start looking elsewhere or try picking up SAS?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For some explanation, I am more familiar with PyTorch but I wanted to refresh my knowledge of machine learning and deep learning concepts. However, with the recent trend of moving away from TensorFlow and towards PyTorch, I wonder if TensorFlow and other ML frameworks are still worth learning today. I know certain algorithms are exclusively implemented in one or the other framework.
 I think at least TensorFlow is good since they’re well-documented and put to the test by other experts. But I’m not so sure about the case of newer custom frameworks. If I dive into them, it could be a step back for me especially after reading this article. It talks about newer ML framework launches and how a lot of people try it out at first, but then interest in said frameworks starts to decrease.
 I know there are a bunch of good custom frameworks out there but it might take more time for new tools to become mainstream or eventually die down. Which is why I’m afraid to use them at the moment. Let me know what you all think! Thanks!

 I'm part of a book club at work that includes data scientists, but also more general data analysts. 
 We've just finished 'Hands on Machine Learning' which was great as it started from fundamentals but got on to quite advanced topics.
 I'd like us to tackle NLP next, but I'm struggling to identify a suitable book. Ideally, it should start at first principles and then move on to modern tools like spaCy, and finish on BERT and transformers. 
 I can easily find both basic and advanced books, but nothing comprehensive, and a lot of out of date content.
 Does the sub have any recommendations for good books?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title correction: Adstock parameter *selection*
 In Marketing Mix Modeling, it is a common preprocessing step to apply the adstock function to the data to model carryover effects. The adstock usually has one parameter that needs to be estimated somehow. It can be estimated by using prior business knowledge, or it can found with cross-validation to find the one that fits the data best, for example by choosing the model with highest R2 (or other metrics).
 However, there might be multiple adstock values that result to very similar R2. With many media variables, it is easy to have models with very different adstock parameters per variable but with very similar R2.
 In this situation, what is the common practice to select a model?
 Note: A Google publication touches upon a similar issue (section 4.3.2) but without clear answer.
 Thank you!

I want to develop a AI model which will determine that if the space in a room is enough or not. Like it’ll determine whether the space in the room in enough or not. We’ll provide the pictures of the room and it’ll give us the output. I think there might be some pre-trained models out there which might be helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings everyone.
 In some days I will undergo my last step in the hiring process for a Senior Data Analyst role. 
 The first phase was an introductory call with the hiring manager.
 The second phase was an assignment (end-to-end data analysis) they sent me and i had to finish it in 2 days' time and send it.
 The last phase is something like a "virtual working day" where i work with the official team from 9 through 5 and in this time period, i have to finish an assignment and present it to the stakeholders of the company. 
 The thing is that i have no idea what are they going to ask, my thinking is that in ~7h is really hard to finish a data analysis project end to end and also do a kickass presentation for it. I don't know if I should expect an end-to-end project or something "lighter". A full project seems too much for me in this timeframe (depends on the # columns though but still..).
 ​
 Has anyone had any similar type of experience? can anybody tell me what I should expect?

 Abstract: 
  
Recent progress in generative models, especially in text-guided diffusion models, has enabled the production of aesthetically-pleasing imagery resembling the works of professional human artists. However, one has to carefully compose the textual description, called the prompt, and augment it with a set of clarifying keywords. Since aesthetics are challenging to evaluate computationally, human feedback is needed to determine the optimal prompt formulation and keyword combination. In this paper, we present a human-in-the-loop approach to learning the most useful combination of prompt keywords using a genetic algorithm. We also show how such an approach can improve the aesthetic appeal of images depicting the same descriptions.

The interview went really well, and they asked if I would be interested in a technical program management role or if I wanted to strictly stick with the original data science role. As far as I know, the pay is the same. Is the ceiling higher for TPM’s? Is TPM a major career shift? I’m definitely more people oriented, so this feels like a good fit, but I want to make sure I’m making the right career move.
