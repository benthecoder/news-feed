        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm taking a class where the professor is talking about removing data points based on IQR and based on variance... Does it ever make sense to remove data points based solely on this?
 Another question I have is about removing duplicates. She says we should ALWAYS remove duplicates. Is this correct?
 I'm asking because this does not make any sense to me.
 I thought you should only remove data points if they don't represent the real world data distribution (duplicate data entry, wrong measurement, etc...) but in case of doubt (like in our assignments because we don't have enough domain knowledge/knowledge of how the measurements were made) you we should never remove these data points
 EDIT: I want to get a good grade so I'm going to do what she says in the assignments and tests but I want to know what real data scientists do and what I should store as knowledge

Most of te columns are fine but the location column is unbelievably dirty; the provinces are either wriiten in full, in short form, written in a way i cannot extract the province using split(), not written at all but instead only the city is written.
 So far I used a third party library that finds the province using the latitude, longitude of each observation ( This works but it takes more than 30 mins to complete)

 I just wrote my first book! :) It's called "Little Book of Principles" by Homerus Gigas. 
 I used artificial intelligence (ChatGPT) to compile the wisdom of many great thinkers, including Lao Tzu, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and Krishnamurti, into a collection of art and poetry - written in the style of the Tao Te Ching. Then I used StableDiffusion to illustrate the book. 
 I'm not sure if I can post the link to the book here, but would love to get your feedback on the book! It's currently for free on Amazon.

However, after you've printed a bunch of pages, they stop working and display the error message "Printer setup incomplete. Your HP+ printer must be set up using the HP Smart app. Visit 123.hp.com to download the app and complete the guided setup. Any pages you have printed were intended for setup and have been exhausted."
Conveniently, this usually doesn't happen until it's too late to return the printer.

 b) start an online masters that could be comped by my job but through Purdue Global or 
 c) just keep applying and trying to add some projects that hopefully catch the eye of recruiters.
 Given that I already have a data-related masters (biostatistics) with *some * PhD level coursework (longer story), courses in graduate level biology, chemistry and neuroscience, and have been a working but miserable and bored statistician for over two years now, 
 what would you do if you were me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! I'm not sure if anyone here will find this useful or interesting, but I have a Youtube channel where I make Python tutorial videos focusing on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. I'm currently a Bioinformatics PhD student, and I'm trying to share the material I learn in grad school with the internet so that other people can learn these skills for free.
 For example, here is a video I just uploaded on how to make gene expression heatmap plots in Python.
 And here is an entire course I made on writing simulations of gene regulatory networks with Python.
 Bioinformatics is a really cool and exciting field to work in, and definitely a career path that programmers should consider (even if you don't have any prior biology background). I hoping my videos will help introduce people to this field and learn some new, useful skills.
 Btw I'm not exactly sure what the self-promotion rules are for this sub, so I apologize if I violated any rules or anything!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TDD has always been a great in theory, pain in the ass in practice approach to me. Writing tests and covering edge cases before you even write a line of code, far too much thinking ahead for my liking. But pairing that with a bot that gives mostly right but subtle when wrong code, seems like a perfect match. Write the tests yourself, then let gpt write the code. Do people think it's plausible that it could take over via tools like gpt/copilot in the next few years?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I’m unsure of what career I want to pursue, but based on my interests and skills, I think working in Data Analytics or UX/UI design is where i want to be. My school doesn’t offer Stats or Web Design as majors, but the DS degree teaches Python, Java, R, and SQL. I also want to minor in Chinese (for fun). I just want to know that I’m making the right decision, especially since I’m a bit behind (I’m an English major right now, though I realized that it’s now what I want to do with my life.) I considered sticking with English and teaching myself the skills, though I’d imagine they’d just toss my resume. 
 I’m just a bit worried about the future and know that this sub prefers Stats. Any advice to make the most of my education (i have a full-ride) would be welcome!

I'm wondering what kinds of professions/industries work with data like this (and don't just analyze each kind individually) and what tools do they use, that I could use as inspiration for my work?
 Is there any terminology that can be used to more precisely describe the kind of analysis I'm looking for?

Does anyone have a suggestion for a book or other resource that covers these sorts of situations? Both in terms of visualizing these sorts of analyses and performing statistics.

 All other things being relatively equal, let's say.
 Is Excel the huge red flag to GTFO or have any of you had experiences successfully pulling data out of the trenches?
 And broader - I think the philosophical question here is - from the lens of data science, is software like Tableau, for example, a crutch? or should it be seen as allowing you to get to business value added insights faster?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I decided to scratch my own itch and write about things happening in mediatech weekly. (Done it for 3 weeks now)
 And as there’s an AI boom happening, the content will be generative-AI heavy. 
 Backstory:
 I’ve been working in tech/media/marketing for years, and for the past couple of years have closely followed what’s happening in generative AI, VR, creative production, design-tech, etc.
 Everything audiovisual - creating - writing-media essentially.
 But I’ve never found any newsletter focusing on this broad yet niche topic, so I created my own. 
 There’s just so much exciting stuff happening currently in generative AI (and media in general) that’s worth sharing.
 I’m trying to capture the biggest announcements every week. 
 This isn’t one of those highly technical, solely Ai newsletters covering everything about the industry in deep nuance. 
 It’s for a broader audience interested in all the cool stuff happening in media. 
 The content varies from week to week. 
 But it includes a couple of longer stories & links to news, or products, or demos, or videos, or papers, etc. 
 Some of the stuff in the last email: 
  
ChatGPTs threat to Google and our society
 5 Ideas people could build on top of ChatGPT (For example, ads & BS-free recipes. Googling recipes is a torture.)
 Cool stuff people have used ChatGPT for. 
 European Union spent €400,000 on a metaverse party 5 people attended.
 World Cup fans using Snapchat filters to stick to display the pride flag at football games.
 And ofc, Snoop Dobby Dobb (Snoop Dogg X Dobby from Harry Potter)

 If you’re interested in checking it out, there’s a link in the comments. 
 And if you hate me for posting this. Call me a spammer, cast a spell on me, and hold a grudge for the rest of your life. 
 Todaloo!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If anyone can offer any guidance on problems I'm having with my chatbot, I would be very grateful. 
 The default model is here: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/chatbot_tutorial.html
 It is a sequence to sequence RNN encoder-decoder with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). It uses a greedy search method and a Luong attention layer. 
 My task is to alter it, the project is very open ended. I've decided to try and change it into a "therapist/doctor-Bot". At the moment everything is the same but I'm inputting vastly different datasets to the movie_dialog conversations that were default. 
 Problems:
  
loss: messing with normal parameters (learning rate, number of layers doesn't seem to be helping all that much, can't seem to get the loss < 3. The best I've got so far is 2.4, but that took approx. 3 hours of training with multiple disruptions from Colabs GPU. 
 
Sentence length: I have a pretty big dataset formed from 4 separate datasets of patient doctor conversations. Most of the sentences are > 20 words long. At the moment I've limited it to process sentences of 100 words. I can't go too low, the patient doctor conversations are simply very long and if I reduce the sentence length too much I don't have many patient-doctor sentences left to train the model! This is a substantial problem to overcome I feel. The default sentence length was 10, and training was much quicker as a result. 
 
Talking to the bot: The main issue appears to be that the bot's response sentence tends to repeat tends to repeat tends to repeat tends to repeat tends to repeat tends to repeat... etc. Just like that, in a single response. Any tips on how to prevent this? It also will repeat the same response to different questions, especially if those questions are short in length. I can't figure out where in code I should attempt to "punish" the bot for doing this. 
 
 Thanks for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a data analyst. Not scientist. However I do have interest in building basic models for certain ideas that I have. For example, recently I wanted to build a model that predicts if a customer will make a purchase. 
 In model building, I usually start googling, reading up tutorials, going to YouTube etc. When I find something that works, for example a logistic regression model, I use the code, execute and then try to understand the workings of the code and math (on a high level that is). 
 I don't know the code or math natively. But I can Google and then reverse engineering the understanding. At the end I feel proud of my work but then start to realize that it's just all YouTube and google that I used. Is this common?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am very bad at writing stories as i am too fact oriented and also englisk is not my first language.
 Using Chad (ChatGPT) we wrote my true story.
 I told it the plot and the important details. And after about ½ hour we together had written this true story. Chad took my facts and reformulated them also describing the scenery. It even added some details that was true but i did not tell it.
 I had to hold Chads hand or he wondered of on tangents. But easy to 'nudge' him back on track.
 Then i used the Colab Notebook from tortoise-tts to train a TEXT2SPEECH model with the voice of a famous narrator where i sampled 3 times 10 sec. speech and used for training. No intention to get the voice to sound like the original narrator but just as an ok human like voice.
 Added some ambience sounds and this is the result:

 I welcome Chad (my name for ChatGPT) as a new tool in my digital toolbox.

 TLDR: Any A/B/n test books for intermediate-advanced statistics readers?
 ​
 Hope all of all of you are enjoying your weekend!
 I recently joined the product data science team in my company and have been asked to work on the projects related to company's experiment (A/B/n tests).
 To understand better on the underlying methodologies (e.g., Sequential testing) and theories on A/B testing, I am hoping to gain some insights from books.
 Could anyone recommend some books on this?
 ​
 FYI, so far, here is the list of my books for A/B testing on my shelf:
  
Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments: A Practical Guide to A/B Testing, Ron Kohavi
 Statistical Methods in Online A/B Testing: Statistics for data-driven business decisions and risk management in e-commerce, Georgi Zdravkov Georgiev
 And other medical / clinical trial statistics textbooks
  
​
 Thanks in advance and enjoy your weekend all ;)

 Hey all,
 I've been working as a data professional for the past 5 years in academia and government after obtaining a masters degree in clinical research (strong stats skills). I've seen people say 'all you need to know is a little bit of python and you can EASILY get a $150K+ data science job". I don't know if that's people just exaggerating on the internet or that I'm truly behind (it does feel like my progression hasn't been as great as others at times).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently using tweepy.Cursor(api.search_tweets, q=query, result_type = 'recent', count=500000).items(500000) to get the all the tweets regarding a specific query from the last 7 days. My concern is, will this hit the rate limit for twitter api? How many requests would this be?
 And what's the difference if I do:
 tweepy.Cursor(api.search_tweets, q=query, result_type = 'recent', count=500000).items()
 tweepy.Cursor(api.search_tweets, q=query, result_type = 'recent').items(500000)
 Thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Where I stand for context: So, I used to do Machine Learning in my university (a few years ago) but then shifted to back end for some time and now I'm trying to get back to ML. I have a good math background and I'm thorough in Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Probability and Statistics, etc. I have completed Andrew Ng's ML Course. I studied CNN through Karpathy's CS231N, and have studied about RNN, GAN, Transformers, and some other Deep learning models from discrete sources. I have used Tf/Keras/Numpy/Scikit/Pandas, etc., before.
 My query: It's been a long time since I last worked on any ML project. Things have changed A LOT since then. I have no idea about the workflow of any ML project right now. How the data is prepared, how to check what parameters would good for training, how to understand the data, how pre-trained models are used, where to deploy, etc. In short, I know the basics but I don't know the application/workflow part today. Can someone please suggest me where to go from here? Any course that would help me with this? I want to know how to understand the data and how to select the best model for any application. I used to write models back then but now pre trained models are used mostly. Where to start? What resource would help me the most? Any course that would help me understand the workflow that's being used in the industry currently?
 Thanks a lot.

I have also written this book with working programmers in mind. Many of them may have not had a formal computer science education, or at least one that included a proper introduction to programming languages. At some point, like that 90% of students, some of them become curious about the media they use. I want this book to speak to them, gently drawing them away from the hustle and bustle of daily programming into a space of reflection and thought.
