        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I wanted to ask your opinion if you think DS is over saturated? I know DS is an umbrella term since it can be applied to various industries and academia but what direction do we see the field moving? It seems with all of these new “breakthroughs” like ChatGPT that we will have no need for as many humans to code and work through standard data related problems if computers can just learn to solve it themselves. Maybe a pessimistic view but Ive just started learning DS and really enjoy it. Just seeing how others feel in general if their will be a big need 10 years from now.

 Few questions I have are 
 Is there a way to simulate model in production by backtesting a fitted model with drift triggers? Is this be a practice?
 Does data drift alone work or is it necessary to have error analysis dashboards set up to monitor where the model can mess up through time.
 What about features importance, wouldn’t feature value loss/gain importance with time? Is it better to stick to what makes sense then select features later? (Even when using more robust methods such as SHAP these features can lose value eventually)
 I would like to learn more and take insight if possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear datascience sub.
 My team is asking some advices on some A/B testing regarding a model I did not design and I also now need your help !
 Let's say we created a ML tool that returns me a list of clients that are considered as "high value". The first time after being detected that they enter one of our shop, we greet them in a special manner. Some of those detected are NOT "activated" in order to be our control group.
 Now, stakeholders want to know if the model works, meaning if there is a difference between the clients we contacted and the ones in the control group : we shall look at expense, number of visit, etc.
 How would you compare the two groups, knowing that within the group of people who are activated, all of them are at a different date (and I don't want any time effect to pollute the analysis...)
 Any ideas ? Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I went to school to learn about coding and am currently working as a software engineer. I like working in tech industry. But since anybody with a internet connection and laptop can pretty much learn what I do and get into this industry or data science, I was wondering if this is a good career. Because of lower barrier to entry, it creates more competition.
 For example, in career such as law, doctor ..etc. you need a good degree and few years of training. The cost of these is high and there is a high barrier for entry. One simply cannot become a doctor or a lawyer without having credentials. You cannot become a lawyer by watching youtube tutorials. In that way are these professions more stable and more secured with lower competition compared to tech careers?

 I just use a basic excel spreadsheet and 95% precut cover letter and I am at 151 jobs applied to since Thanksgiving and I got two callbacks this week. Marketing Analytics and Data Science Analyst position both sent me links to www.codility.com
 The first is likely 100% remote and recruiter has been very prompt and forwarded me to a tech screen. I just got off the phone with the “it’s pretty standard but you should have no problem if you know what you’re doing”
 …famous last words.
 These recruiters each need me to do a two hour “codility” test, which I’ve never heard of but who has tips about the format or what to expect?
 Obviously I’m not asking for any answers or links to data dumps, I just have never heard of and don’t know what to expect for www.codility.com. Any reccomendations that I can prepare or brush up on my SQL code or maybe they’re more situational questions I don’t know?
 I’ve signed up for the developer account and waiting for their verification email to start to practice but advice is welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am working on a data science task for my university. The goal is simple: Two datasets have the same "meaning", but the data record content is written differently. The task is to create a machine-learning model which predicts whether the data record is the same or not. My problem is: what is the best way to convert both data records so they can be used for an ml model (I am currently using sklearn.linear_model => LogisticRegression as a machine learning model). I already tried doc2vec, but my results were poor, and I am now trying to use TfidfVectorizer. But there, my problem is that my feature vectors have different lengths. Do you have any tips on how to solve this?

 ​
 Hey everyone! I graduated from my bachelor’s in Biomedical Sciences this past spring, and have been exploring career options since then, including working at a clinical job, a research job, and self-learning programming/advanced math. 
 I’ve come to realize I enjoy specific aspects from each experience:
  
Data visualization: I enjoy analyzing and communicating research visually, pulling from background courses in biostatistics and graphic design. 
 Research methodology: I noticed that the subject matter didn’t matter (ranging from cell biology to public health), but rather I take interest in how research is s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started using the statsmodels python package and I'm having trouble figuring out how we should fit and evaluate a time series model.
 My way of thinking was: you split data into train and test, you train a model with the train data (say ARIMA for example) and you evaluate it on the test set, but I've seen people do different things.
 I saw a lot of people feed the ARIMA model the whole dataset, fit it and then evaluate on the last couple of data points. This would be training and evaluating on the same dataset and I'm sure that is wrong.
 I've also seen people train the model with the train data and then forecast X time steps into the future and compare those results with the test set (RMSE, R^2, etc...), but this has the disadvantage that the forecasted values will tend towards the mean, so it's not really a good way to evaluate the model, right?
 Why isn't there a more straight forward way to do this with statsmodels? At least from what I've seen you can't feed an already trained model test data to evaluate it, right?
 I thought it should be done like it is done in this notebook but I never seem him give the model the test data, so how can it work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this moment, I am close to losing my job as an investigator at a university where I have been working with machine learning models for almost 2 years. Because of this, I am thinking of starting as a freelancer as a data analyst and then as a data scientist. However, I am aware that the business environment is very different from the academic environment. So, I want to ask, what should I know (or study) before starting so that this transition is not so difficult and I can perform better as a professional?
 Currently, I am working on a portfolio using Kaggle's competitions and reading "Storytelling with Data" by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic.
 I am very grateful for any input that can help me in what seems to be a new phase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, just to focus this question, I don’t want to touch the subject of password patterns or password generation.  Let’s focus only on “random passwords” (for whatever that means) of a given entropy.  (In other words, let’s assume there is a fool-proof function genpwd(entropy_bits) that generates a password with the given entropy and we’ll just use whatever it spits out.)
Also, to focus even more, the intended use-case is for encrypted offline storage (which includes anything from GnuPG keys, Age encrypted files, full-disk-encryption, etc.).
Furthermore, the only threat we want to protect against is brute-force against the cryptographic primitives.  Furthermore say the attacker has enough hardware power (say a few millions $) and enough patience (say a few years).  And let’s also assume we’ve reached the peak of the technology capabilities (both hardware and software).
(I am well aware that by now I have waved away so many potential attack vectors that we are currently in the theoretical space…)
Given all that, the obvious answer is “just use a password with at least as many entropy bits as the underlying cryptographic construct”.  (For example in the case of something based on AES-128, just use a 128 entropy bits password, passed through an at least 128 bit hash function;  key derivation with iterations isn’t needed.)
However, at the other end there is memorability which pushes the entropy down.  As a user I would prefer to use a short and memorable password (regardless of what that means), which means having fewer entropy bits.
Another complication is password derivation functions (like Argon, scrypt, bcrypt, the newer bscrypt, or in the worst case some variant of PBKDF) which helps us gain some entropy bits through time spent.
So my question is:  given adequate defaults for a password derivation function, how many bits of entropy do I require for my password to be practically unbreakable in my lifetime (~100 years)?
Is 64 bits enough?  Is 72 bits enough?  Should I go up to 128 bits?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My career started as an academic doing my PhD in cancer immunology research and extended through jobs at Harvard Medical School (Postdoc), Uber, Facebook, McKinsey & Company.. and finally back to doing cancer research again.
 Over the years I've found that "Data Scientist" is a heterogenous term that primarily centres around anyone who can derive insight from data. And I've worked with both the traditional data scientist CS/Stats background types all the way through to data scientists with bachelors in Art History. The bottom line is that each bring their own unique and very invaluable thinking styles to the field.
 The art historian turned data scientist once proposed an extremely interesting way of organising plots way before sns.pairplot() was a thing, our client LOVED it. Another data scientist who had a background in sociology was able to pull some awesome insights around credit default rates given the average number of letterboxes in a neighbourhood.
 The point is, some of the best DS people I've worked with came from eclectic backgrounds and it's usually those ones that I learn from the most. So if you're thinking about becoming a data scientist, don't be dissuaded by the coding aspect (which can be learned in months). The thinking style you've cultivated takes YEARS to develop.
 ​
 EDIT: a bunch of people have been asking about DS entry programmes. Don't pay for tech skills you can learn for free on youtube. For example I teach DS on my channel - the fundamentals - totally free forever.

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCN_14OCc8&t=2s - Week 2
 If guys need any help breaking into the industry shoot me a DM and I'll see if there's anyone I know that can refer you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Our retail customers sell products through our platform, they are free to enter the product name as they see fit, this causes a problem as we would have different strings referring to the same product.
 ​
  
 product entered by user actual product in reference table 
  
 tothbrush red 100 toothbrush red 100 
  toothb r 100 toothbrush red 100 
  X shampooooo! 100ml X shampoo 100ml 
 
 I would like to build a model that given a text entered by the user it will find it's closest match from a reference list containing all the product names. However, I have three major concerns:
  
Thousands of products are sold each day, comparing thousands of products with the reference list that is approximately 10,000 (and keeps growing) would yield tens of millions of iterations. How would I tackle this computational complexity.
 I am thinking of using sentence transformers, where the incoming product embedding is compared to the embeddings of the products the reference list, returning the one with the max similarity, or using a siamese network where each pair of products is fed to the network and return the first match found.
 The goal of this exercise is to diminish the manual work involved in linking the products, but how do I define a similarity threshold, such that if the similarity is not sufficient, it has to be reviewed manually by humans.
  
Note: I can utilize an additional feature such as the price of the product to reduce the number of products am iterating over as well.
 your thoughts veterans would be highly appreciated.

 I created a data analytics portfolio consisting of SQL projects on Github. I had my friend review it who works as a data analyst, and he liked these projects.
 However, he pointed out that my SQL projects consist of files that have bunch of queries in them. But their outputs are not visible in these files, since there would be at times too many rows visible.
 Now, is there a simple way to display query outputs for these projects on my portfolio in Github. I am currently thinking of creating xlsx files for each project showcasing the query outputs. 
 Thanks in advance for your help!

 In this role, I was actually doing Data Engineering. 
 Is it generally a bad idea to change that job title on resumes/LinkedIn? People say they do this, but it seems like you would fail background checks.
 I ask because I plan to transition to DE next year.
