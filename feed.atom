 The following attached pictures are outputs from the same Tweedie model with power parameter = 1. The only difference being one uses the default IRLS optimizer and the other one uses a powell optimizer. How can the resulting p values and coefficients be so drastically different as a result? Isn't this changing hte entire result based on what optimizer I use?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have tabular data where each group of 100 rows represents a deployment of a specific geometry that has certain features measured. For example, I have 10000 deployments stored in a column called "Dep," which ranges from 1 to 10000. When fitting this data to an xgboost model, the model may mistakenly assume that the deployment numbers have an ordering relationship (e.g., that deployment 1 is less than deployment 2, which is less than deployment 3, and so on). However, this is not the case because all deployments are independent of each other. On the other hand, if I remove the "Dep" column, the model will not be able to differentiate between the different deployment groups and their unique geometries.
 I got the idea of one hot encoding of the column dep, but it's useless as the training dataset has 7000 deployments while the test dataset has 3000. If I do a one hot encoding, the shapes will not match (along with a slew of other issues). Better think of another approach.
 What is the solution to this issue?

Did a data science boot camp, learned python, PostgreSQL, scikit learn 3. Did 10+ guided and unguided projects 4. Achieved Data scientist certification and AWS ML specialty certification 5. Doing a mentorship program, refined resume, LinkedIn and other job boards profiles 6. Applied to easyapply jobs, applied on websites, asked people for referrals and applied. Have been doing it while working full-time. But no luck. It seems a never ending process.

Opinion: I think PCs are better because you have more control over your machine. The only advantage Mac has is that it's already on a UNIX system.

 I wanted to share a new video I just released on YouTube here called "Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA) Paper Explained." It's a deep dive into the concepts and techniques of ADDA, which is a powerful method for adapting machine learning models to new domains. If you're interested in machine learning and domain adaptation, I think you'll really enjoy it.
 Thanks for considering giving it a watch, and I hope you find it helpful! As always, feedback is extremely welcomed!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The annual survey on the state of AI from McKinsey's QuantumBlack artificial intelligence division shows business adoption of the technology has doubled in the last five years. Half of the survey's respondents said their business has adopted AI in at least one business area. That's up from 20% of respondents in 2017.
 McKinsey also found that AI is being embedded into a wider range of business capabilities. The average user of AI in business is now using the technology in 3.8 applications, compared to 1.9 in 2018.
 The use of AI in business covers a spectrum of applications, including process automation, digital twins, and facial recognition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was born in the late 90s so by the time I got involved in technology, my introduction to Unix and Unix-flavored systems was limited to Linux and MacOS. However, I've read about the history of Unix at Bell Labs, the BSD systems derived from research Unix, and the eventual commercial releases of Unix System V from AT&T themselves. I also see that HP-UX, AIX, and Solaris are apparently still maintained and get releases, which suggests that they are still being used in production in some places.
I'm curious if anyone here currently works (or has very recently worked) somewhere where proprietary Unix is still used for production. If so, can you tell me what they're used for and why those deployments haven't been moved to an appropriate Linux distribution?
Not suggesting Linux is necessarily better for all use cases, just wondering what keeps these small number of entities clinging to closed-source Unix with presumably pricey license costs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I have a DS technical interview coming up. I asked the recruiter and she said it won’t be a coding technical interview but they want to know more about how I would work through problems. Does anyone have any ways on preparing for this? This is my first DS interview and I’m about to be a new grad so I have no idea what to expect 😭

I want to grab the same data (within the same city) from a few different sites and compare it all. What would be the best way to structure this project? Should I write multiple functions to pull from each website, or would this be too messy? Would anyone be able to share some examples of projects that pull the same data from multiple sites and compare them? thank you!!

A bot that functions as your best friend/soulmate, who can communicate with you, cheer you up, support you, entertain you, debate with you, make jokes that are perfect for your particular sense of humor, order your favourite food online and have it arrive a few minutes after you get home, etc. 
 I believe this would be a game changer not just for old people, who live alone, but for everyone. People would spend more time with that bot than with social media. 
 When I see how good some of the recent AIs have becone, I wonder how long it will take until we get this. What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent article I read discussed the most current AI news. A brand-new AI product on the market is getting a lot of attention. 
 ChatGPT is a piece of software that allows people to converse with a computer by typing in a question or task, and the program will create a response that is intended to appear human. We fed it billions of Internet-sourced text samples to train it. Moreover, one of its distinguishing features is its ability to grasp and generate natural language. This indicates that it may answer naturally and conversationally, making it a helpful tool in various settings. 
 However, how well the processing technology "understands" language is unknown. But still, it is getting people talking. According to the researchers, "you can have what looks dangerously similar to a human dialogue with it." ChatGPT has grown in popularity as a result of its ease of use. It has only been open to the public for 11 days, yet it already has over a million users, making it more popular than Facebook in less time. 
 Although, it faces challenges that even the company behind it admits, such as a proclivity to make "nonsense" as it advances. 
 Please let me know if you have any recommendations or believe this topic might interest you. https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-1.6681401

What I want to do is to train with small, medium, and large training sets, and to reduce variability, using three different random splits for a total of nine models.
 How should I go about splitting the data into train and test sets? For each random split, do I take a random 20% test set first, and then from the remaining values randomly generate the differently sized training sets? When looking at the effects of training set size, should the smaller training sets be a subset of the next larger training set or completely random? How do I go about analyzing the results and comparing the nine different models?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m adapting one of my old algorithms where adds features based on some weight vector and then recalculates a score to see if adding the new feature helps. 
 I’m testing it on the iris dataset with 996 noise features and noticed that sometimes it adds around 50-90 noise features because it increases the accuracy. Less features is more in this case so I’m wondering if there is any penalty I can add that is on the same scale as the scoring metric (eg accuracy for classification which ranges from [0,1] or negative mean squared error which goes from (-inf,0]) but based on the number of features. Basically saying “is it really worth it to add this feature?”
 I know there’s L1 and L2 penalty for linear models but I don’t think that applies here because if o square the number of features or something it will be largely out of scale with the scoring metric (eg adding a feature has a positive change in accuracy of 0.3 so let’s keep it, another feature only adds to the accuracy by 0.001 so let’s not add it). 
 Any brainstorming on this would be very helpful so don’t hesitate. I’m currently stuck on this idea.

 I live in a Midwestern city and I have been looking for an onsite data science/statistician role. I'm that weirdo that actually hates remote work and I've been doing it for 2.5 years and I don't want to do it anymore! I thought my willingness to work in person would make my job search easy and quick.
 I'm a week into my full-tilt job search and so far all of the local jobs I'm qualified for don't pay what I'm looking for... and then recruiters contact me about remote jobs that pay way more 😭.
 My partner keeps encouraging me to prioritize finding an onsite job instead of giving into the temptation of picking a higher-paying remote job, but it's tough. I start thinking "well, I'm already working remotely... And at least here I'd make significantly more money..." But frankly if I can't find an onsite position then I should just stay where I am. 
 Where are all the good paying local jobs at?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[10 months ago, I started to work at a company that uses Slack heavily. They have 1000+ channels and my team is tagged in a lot of stuff so I get a lot of notifications.
I can't concentrate at all. It's not like it's annoying, I simply cannot work.
I have been spending 10x more energy since I started to just keep above the water but now, after 10 months, I'm simply drowning and my tickets are all piling up.
I don't want to be that person that's not reachable but more and more, I'm thinking about closing Slack and opening it 2-3x a day.
Any advice?

I really want to get involved in AI and start creating my own projects but I did not study coding and feel like this would be a must for AI?
 Is it even remotely possible to get into AI and learn how to utilise its power without knowing fundamental coding principles?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm almost certain this is already an idea someone thought of, but I had to write it out here anyways, just in case. I think a super interesting use for AI voice generation/cloning of someone else's voice could be to generate the vocal audio for movies, in different languages. This could also probably apply to the video too, since that's possible now also. I think real acting and vocals are the way to go first, but I think this could also be a great fill-in if the actor doesn't know different languages, or if the movie is under too low of a budget to record in different languages. Then you get the actor's same exact voice, but in different languages! Sounds surreal, and super cool. There's a lot more CGI in movies nowadays, and that has become the norm, so I imagine this could have a similar outcome if it started to happen more and more (relating this to CGI, from feeling foreign to becoming more popular and part of the norm). What's your thoughts? Not sure if I like it, but I do like it as an idea at least 😆

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like, are there entry level jobs that are open to people who don't have a degree in data science or statistics if they have some knowledge of the field? I'd honestly consider switching majors, considering how much I've liked all the DS courses I took for my minor (just completed the minor) and that some of my favorite EE courses have been those that use a lot of statistics, if I weren't more than halfway finished with the degree already. 
 Would it help if I have some software engineering experience (I did an 8 month internship in firmware test engineering this year, which was mostly low-level C programming), or is that not really relevant, since statistical coding is pretty different from software engineering? Would I be better off looking for an SE role that involves working with a lot of data for a few years and then later on looking for something more directly in the data science field? 
 I'm also trying to do some personal DS projects, just for fun and personal knowledge, because, you know, data science is cool. Would that help my chances at all? Or would applying for DS roles right out of college be a waste of time without my degree being in data science or a directly adjacent field?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I posted last night asking whether it's worth learning SQL if I'm only doing DS as a hobby, and a lot of people said there's more I can do if I know SQL. So I'm willing to give it a try, but I don't really know where to start. I mean, there are plenty of tutorials available online, but I learn best from doing an actual project and looking stuff up as I go (I'm not interested in doing a course on Udemy or the like because I hate learning from recorded lectures -- especially since I'm doing this for fun, because I like data science, I don't want to force myself to watch a bunch of lectures). So I was thinking I'd find an actual database online with an interesting dataset, pick some project I'd like to do with it, and then find tutorials in to how to use SQL to extract, clean, and manipulate data, and use them as I go. That's pretty much how I've been learning statistical coding in both R and Python. 
 The problem is, when I Googled variations of "publicly available databases", I just found freely available datasets, the same type of stuff I'd find if I Googled "free datasets". I figure there have to be actual databases available to the public, because otherwise how would anyone self-teach SQL, but clearly I'm using the wrong search terms to find them. 
 Part of the problem is perhaps that I haven't had a course on what databases even are really -- I just completed a DS minor, but all the projects and assignments we did involved using R and/or Python to read in data from a CSV or XLXS file. I have a general idea of what databases are and I figured I'd learn more about them as I started using SQL (I learned about data cleaning and manipulation almost entirely from doing projects in R) but right now I'm very much a newbie to databases. 
 Does anyone have any suggestions for the search terms I should be using to find a database I can use for learning? Or links to any websites with freely available data stored in a database?

 Is it something which is super important or just a fancy accessory that you throw in your resume or cover letter? Never getting checked. 
 Also are there any other social media or project hosting sites that recruiters specifically look out for?
 Thank you.
