        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently applying to jobs and almost any company asks for at least 4 interviews plus a test. I spent the last 2 week-ends doing those tests for 2 different companies and then received feedback that they chose other candidates. This is the last one I have received. Do you guys think this is reasonable? I feel like doing this within a job would take weeks in order to do it properly, and they want you to do it in a few days after your day job. Not to mention that this should be paid. What can we do to change this trend?
 Looking forward to hearing your comments.
 ​
 PD: I have been a DS for 10+ years.
 PD2: they still have not said if my salary expectations would be good on their side, because, you know, it depends of your test performance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m curious what people make of this situation; in particular the general issue of tech companies being unwilling to place stronger than “do whatever you want” restrictions on open-source code.
in this instance i understand that the company wants to switch a license because they only have an approved set. but what about changing that set? what are some good open-source licenses that allow us to place (small, let’s face it) restrictions on our users?
does anyone have any opinions on how we can push companies that do contribute to OS to use more progressive licenses? (i.e. recognition that neutrality is in fact not “neutral”, etc, etc.)

The model will accept a full instrumental music (1-3 mins) as an input for prediction. And will predict all the musical notes by sequence. What could be the best model or algorithm to use for this project? If you want me to clarify something please do. Thanks!

I am interested in data science and machine learning specifically in the finance domain, and I would like to use these skills to solve a real-world problem.
 So far I’ve thought of an idea to utilize real-time data collected from social media platforms to analyze financial markets, for instance analyzing certain stocks from data collected from Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc. but I feel like this idea is a bit overdone. 
 If you have any ideas, please share them with me! Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! I'm one of the developers that were working on this project for some time. In recent months, users started to ask us more frequently about the ability to run algorithms on a part of graph stored in database - subgraph. Now to do this, we extended the implementation of C API we had and brought to you the graph project feature that enables running algorithms on a specific subset of a graph stored in the database.
You can now do graph analysis with PageRank, degree centrality, betweenness centrality, or any other algorithm on subgraphs without any additional adjustments. Before you had to create new query procedure. You can fire up a graph machine learning algorithm, such as Temporal graph networks and split the dataset inside the query to do training and validation without splitting the dataset programmatically. And last but not least, you can use your graphics card to run one of cuGraph's algorithms on subgraph in terms of seconds.
You can find the whole explanation in blog post [1] and you can checkout the code at Memgraph GitHub [2]. Furthermore you can check cuGraph's algorithms we have integrated [3]
I'd like to hear your feedback on our approach. Also if you have any general feedback, just write it in the comments :)

 I made a video called "The Map of Statistics" on my YouTube channel. It tries to summarize the whole of statistics in one go, and also talks about its relations to Data-Science, Math, Optimization and Computer Science.
 Maybe you find it useful.

I intend to do an Online MS in Data Science and slowly transition into a Data Scientist. Do you think being a part of core Data&AI team can help me progress in my career more than working independently?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Current context: Have two bachelors in CS and Business. Been working as a DS for about a year.
 While working as a DS, I have noticed that job applications for DS have been more explicit in asking for a Masters in CS, Stats, Math, DS etc... So now, I am curious about the future of DS, and whether only individuals with a Masters / PhD will be accepted for these roles; or that experience alone would be enough to bypass these filters?
 Especially at larger tech firms, it seems that they only look for applicants with at least a MS. What do y`all think about this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am building a data science project portfolio type of website and right now I am planning how to build the home page and the basic framework of the website itself. 
 I am thinking that I will use Java and Javascript (in addition to HTML, CSS) to build the website itself. I will reserve Python for the actual Data Science applications.
 I am choosing these languages by default as Java and Python are the only languages I have experience in or knowledge of. Are there any other options I should consider?

 I study a msc in business and data science, where I transferred from a market analysis- oriented bachelors.
 For the third semester we can chose between electives or an internship, where I am wondering whether I should take some statistics/CS heavy electives or if I should do a 6-month internship. 
 As the masters only have 45 ECTS worth of hard, actual Data Science oriented courses, I was wondering what would be the smartest choice ?
