To develop the project based on that thought, I was thinking of putting an endless stream of AI-generated images that respond to live tweets using keywords. Is this doable? 
 I found this website (https://art42.net/) showcasing an endless stream of cubist art pieces and was wondering if there's any way to recreate it so that it responds to tweets using any "x" word or hashtags. (it would be great if it could respond to tweets from specific accounts-but that might be asking for too much lol). 
 Thanks in advance :)!

 I'm currently writing a Tools for Data Science course for my university, and we're wondering what tools would be great to teach students (It's a sophomore level class). This is to get them ready for machine learning/data science internships that they may have during the summer in between their sophomore and junior years, or junior and senior years.
 ​
 We currently looking into these technologies for the class, although any recommendations for the best tools you've used would be great!
  
Git
 Docker
 Tableau
 Google Bigquery
 Amazon Sagemaker
 Cloud Computing In general (Like AWS)
 Apache Airflow
 PySpark
  
Thanks again for all your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'd like to ask for language in the right corporate-speak about the new responsibilities I've taken over in the past year.
 I was hired into as a midlevel Operations & Data Analyst under a Senior Systems & Data Analyst, who left in June. That means I am literally the only Data Analyst left on the team, with no backfill on the horizon. In addition, we had a complete data systems overhaul in May from our 40 year old mainframe system Old System to one I will just call New System. 
 These two events significantly shifted the scope of my responsibilities - now instead of me running and maintaining queries from Old System, I was charged not only to learn the design of New System, but also lead the data community at my institution for best practices and query "recipes."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have years of experience in data science, but for a new project including a big dashboard I want to choose the right libraries. It will be a dashboard "inside the browser", so I need a good JS visualization library.
 I'm looking for:
  
something higher-level than d3.js : d3.js is very cool, but it's too long to create a simple line chart, and this example even doesn't have zoomable plot/pannable axis... Adding the latter would be quite complex to do properly from scratch with d3
 
somehing lower-level than dash/plotly/altair/etc. : I don't want the lib to do the client <-> server for me, actually I don't want the lib to run a Flask/Tornado server for me. I want to do the live plot updating with AJAX myself (with Javascript fetch(...))
 
I need line plots with interactivity (zoom/pan), heatmaps / images (like imshow in Matplotlib), sliders
 
NB: seaborn seems to be mostly static, but I need more interactivity (zoom/pan)
 
 Which JS library would you suggest?

During my first year at DoorDash, I followed conventional criteria for how to plan and ship experiments. Following conventions was a mistake that hurt my velocity and impact, since I wanted to execute on ten ideas, but could only focus on two or three. In this blogpost, I cover several approaches for balancing velocity and experimentation confidence. I personally wish there was someone who gave me this advice earlier in my career, so I'm sharing it here in case folks find it useful.

However, you don't always have lots of data to train your machine learning algorithm. Which classical machine learning methods work well with little data? I'm thinking of things like KNN, linear regression, support vector machines, random forests etc. Is there a paper that systematically investigates machine learning methods when data are sparse? If not, are there some rules of thumb one can follow?

We've made a “data lake” (industry jargon for a large data store with lots of heterogeneous data) that’s optimized for deep learning. Keeping your data in an AI-optimized format means you can ship AI models faster, without having to build complex data infrastructure for image, audio, and video data (check out our GitHub here: https://github.com/activeloopai/deeplake).
Deep Lake stores complex data such as images, audio, videos, annotations/labels, and tabular data, in the form of tensors—a type of data structure used in linear algebra, which AI systems like to consume.
We then rapidly stream the data into three destinations: (a) a SQL-like language (Tensor Query Language) that you can use to query your data; (b) an in-browser…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I'm pretty new here and I'd like to tell you about our open-source project.
 My team and I are interested in the multitude of AI APIs that have emerged on the market in recent years from large cloud providers (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.) but also from AI specialists (OpenAI, DeepL, Assembly AI, etc.) and that allow us to handle specific tasks: image recognition, translation, audio transcription, document parsing, etc.
 We develop an API to rule them all: we standardize competing APIs into a single one so that developers can change providers whenever they want, use several APIs at the same time if needed, combine engines from different providers, etc.
 To be transparent about this standardization, we decided to launch an Open Source version where we display the connectors we created to allow any AI service provider to add its own connector or to allow anyone to use our standardization for free: https://github.com/edenai/edenai-apis/ For those who are interested in these topics, I would love to have your opinion on our project and how to nourish it (please note that at the moment, only members of my team are working on it). As I said at the beginning, it's new for us :)
 Thanks in advance,
 Taha
 PS: If you can star the repo that would be great and would help us a lot!

 I have a list of securities and have collected a list of descriptions that i view as a Value or Growth factor. For example for Value: i have the book to price, dividend yield etc. And for Growth i have eps growth, historical growth, sales growtg etc.
 I have then calculated their z scores, and applied winsorisation to cut of the extreme outliars. 
 Im left with some statisitics - negative and positice applied a weighting for each and summed them up. 
 Now im left with a score positce and negatuce and am confused as which one should be classified as value vs growth? 
 Can someone please provide me witg some guidance please as im stuck on a exercise. Thank you

Unfortunately due to the timeline it will probably be best to just do the analysis myself. I was asking around for reasonable rates and someone told me $50 an hour is a reasonable rate. To be clear this isn’t a long term project, it’s over the next 1.5 months to conduct some analysis and I estimate will take 15-20 hours in total. What hourly rate would you charge for this analysis. Also, the analysis isn’t in depth, it involves some webscraping using Selenium, counting certain words and then visualizing distributions. (All things I know how to do)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was listening to a podcast where they talked about the possibility of utilizing large language model interfaces to optimize learning, the example they gave was, if you want AI to reserve a booking, it would take ages for it to learn this in traditional way, but supplemented by an LLM, it can understand what the words mean and in what context they are utilized so it optimizes its learning.
 That made me wonder, is all current AI learning fundamentally based on trial-and-error approach and only guided by limits set from the outside as it were?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many classification and regression challenges in business have been effectively solved using artificial neural networks. Even Nevertheless, for issues involving pattern categorization, backpropagation neural networks typically forecast more accurately than decision trees. The predictions of neural networks are not as easily interpreted as those of decision trees since they are frequently viewed as "black boxes." It is desirable to extract knowledge from trained neural networks in numerous applications so that the users can comprehend the solution better. This article will help to understand the process of extracting rules using a neural network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in ML/AI in a different country than my own, so I live away from my family. After having lost 3 family members during covid, including dad, I've been doing a lot of thinking about how life is short and whether it really is worth spending the finite time we have far away from family.
 So, I've been looking for jobs in my home country - but either the pay is too low or I need to migrate to the big cities, which defeats the purpose of staying close to (with) family. Therefore, I'm now thinking of trying my hand at DA/DS/ML/AI consulting service.
 But how do I go about setting it up? I set up multiple gigs in Fiverr, one for each subfield (NLP, CV, ML, etc), but I have so far only received 30-100 page views in 2 weeks, and 0 jobs. I've reduced the price of some of the gigs to as low as $5 (starting price), but even then I've received no paid jobs yet (I've had one guy approach me to help him for free on his project).
 Obviously I lack marketing skills. So, do I need to find a marketing partner or hire someone to do the marketing for me? Is it worth paying Google ads for my Fiverr gigs? Or do I spend some time to create my own consulting website and do paid marketing for that, instead of the Fiverr gigs? If there's anybody here who has successfully set up their DS consulting gigs, any help, guidance and direction from you is much appreciated.
 ​
 All the project names in Fiverr start with \"I will\" for buyers, but in the seller dashboard \"I will\" is not shown

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not a data scientist, but looking for guidance on where to start looking. First of all I have my data sets in CSV tables, and am working with the data in python using PanDas.
 So I have a modest set of data, like 500 data points (16 fields and like 30 uses), across around 90 sets of data. But my data is about users... I am wanting to publish the data, but obviously not have the users be obviously identifiable. My data tends to fall within fairly similar ranges across users.
 I'm wondering if there is a way to like 'jiggle' the data so the values don't actually lineup with any individual users, while preserving as much of the underlying statics (like Mean Deviation, Variance etc, but nothing too complex). The data isn't inherently sensitive in any way, most of it can already be obtained through various means, I just don't particularly want to publish something with all the data in one easy to use format, and have individual users easily identified.
 Edit: so the data is already publicly available, there is nothing actually sensitive about it, it's just a bunch of usage data, nothing a kid with a python script couldn't quickly recreate, or a kid with a spreadsheet and too much free time. 🤣😂 I've done similar things myself before I learnt how a simple script can automagically do in seconds what took me hours while watching TV. 
 I'm not actually publishing any directly identifiable data, everything is pseudonyms to the username (and the usernames aren't necessarily identifiable to individuals). I'm just wanting to make the date I publish a tiny bit opaque to the actual reality, I'm probably just being overly sensitive about protecting my users.

 However, I was wondering whether any other method can be used to find out such question pairs.
