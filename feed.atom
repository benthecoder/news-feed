Development continued in the past 6 years, and now clickhouse-local becomes a swiss-army knife for data processing. Say "ffmpeg" for datasets and more.
It can resemble textql, octosql, dsq, duckdb, trdsql, q, datafusion-cli, spyql, but has better capabilities and performance.

"serverless" in the same sense as here: https://www.sqlite.org/serverless.html
and also in the more common sense - clickhouse-local can be packaged into AWS Lambda and serve queries on a per-request basis, as here: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43589

 I'm a masters in DS grad with 4 previous years in analytics trying to improve my skills with data engineering and data modeling. Stanford has a 5-part databases course that looks useful, but it's over 10 years old and I'm not sure how relevant it is today. I did the first part in 2012 and it definitely stands the test of time, but I'm not sure about the rest of the course.
 Here is the course:
 https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ydatabases-databases
 More generally, if people have recommendations for resources to study intermediate/advanced topics in data engineering and data modeling, that would be very helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has the potential to transform the way we diagnose and treat various health conditions. From X-rays to MRI scans, these techniques allow doctors to see inside the human body and identify problems that might not be visible to the naked eye. However, the adoption of AI in the medical field is not without challenges.
 A recent study has explored the determinants for the adoption of AI-powered decision-making support systems in the medical imaging workflow. The study used data from clinicians who participated in an international evaluation of healthcare practitioners and applied confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling to understand the factors that influence the adoption and usage of AI in medical imaging.
 The results of the study showed that understanding the role of security, risk, and trust is crucial for the intended usage of AI in the medical imaging workflow. These findings provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners looking to understand the adoption and acceptance of AI in the medical field.
 As AI continues to make advances in the field of medical imaging, it is important to consider the role of these factors in the adoption and acceptance of AI by healthcare practitioners. By understanding and addressing these challenges, we can ensure that the adoption of AI in medical imaging is seamless and effective.
 In your opinion, what are the biggest challenges to the widespread adoption of AI in the medical imaging workflow?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple quietly launched a catalogue of books narrated by AI in a move that may mark the beginning of the end for human narrators. The strategy marks an attempt to upend the lucrative and fast-growing audiobook market - but it also promises to intensify scrutiny over allegations of Apple's anti-competitive behaviour.
 Apple's development of AI to narrate books could represent a significant shift in how major technology companies see the future of audiobooks.
  
In recent months, Apple approached independent publishers as potential partners, including some in the Canadian market, but not all agreed to participate
 Apple would shoulder the costs of production and writers would receive royalties from sales.
  
The Future
  
While there is potential for backlash by professional voice actors, authors themselves are increasingly being asked to narrate their own books
 There is a financial incentive for the writers, both in the upfront payments and the expanded availability of their work
 But producing an audiobook with a human voice can take weeks and can cost publishers thousands of dollars
  
Apple and Amazon
  
For years, Apple has sold books and audiobooks through its Books app
 Apple was rumored to be interested in developing its own audiobook service and shifting from a reseller to a producer
 The move represents a direct shot at rival Amazon, with Apple listing what it said were the benefits of its own system compared to Kindle's Direct Publishing
 Lawmakers in Europe and the United States have put in place increasing scrutiny of the company in the wake of allegations that Apple limits competition

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently in grad schools for data science and it's cool and all, but there's so much bs to deal with.
 Like, for a final project, we had to have the professors approve our proposal. It was written well, but he just kept rejecting them for dumb reasons and because he said "the data isn't rich enough". Like bruh, that's for me to deal with and you to grade later on, we'll figure it out, I don't need you to hold my hand. Like, I get he wants us to do a good job, but at some point he just has to let us figure it out. Then he approved it two days before the final project was due. Like wtf.
 And then on top of that, the teams, Jesus christ. You would think people in grad school would know how to work in a team.
 We'll be assigned a project due in like 4 weeks. And for the first two weeks (or sometimes more) , no one does anything. So then, I have to speak up and get the ball rolling. But even then, people who know HOW to do tasks won't do them until they are specifically told what to do. Literally, people won't do or say anything until someone else comes and plans it out for them, I've pushed the limit before to see how long people will wait and it's scary how long they will until someone speaks up. 
 So I have to plan everything out for everyone and delegate tasks and then put it all together all while the professor is asking for updates, and of course I have to speak to him because no one else wants to. Like, my guy, let my team do their shit and we'll get it to you. And it's me having to do that like 99% of the time.
 But then it feels isolating because while everyone does their one task, it feels like I'm juggling a million things just to get a final project out so we don't all fail. 
 God, it's so frustrating. I heard it gets easier in the real world, can I hope for that? Any advice for the real world?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm another DS trying to get a job since September. It's been hard to be honest and my savings are getting dangerously low. With 2 YOE (SQL, Stats in R) and a MSc degree I barely qualify to most job ads, even the junior positions.
 I've been doing an Udemy course on ML deployment, but of course this won't compare to having experience in a company, although still covers a lot of topics from modular code to deploying in AWS, CI/CD, Docker, etc.
 I'm wondering if a better use of my time is to focus more on the analytics side (Power BI, ETLs, Excel, etc) than on ML engineering. I've been looking at DA job ads but most of them ask for advanced Excel, being able to write ETLs, etc, so it looks like it's a whole other area that I would need to learn.
 Should I keep on doing the production course or it doesn't have much value if I'm not already in a company trying to implement those things? Or maybe finish that first and then learn at least ETLs? Big data technologies?
 This field is so vast that is hard to have a sense of direction on where to focus my time. Plus you need the time to keep knowledge fresh for any interviews that come about.
 Thank you for your advice :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my boss asked me to make a time series of our current sales data. It has been going up year by year and the only model that has captured that is Facebook Prophet. The problem is the data is non-stationary so I transformed it by differencing. But now the values are too small (some values are even negative). 
 My question is can I transform the data back? How could I do that? Examples in Python would be great.

I have this goal in 2023 to create my own data science projects to improve my skills and learn more about data science but I am struggling what project I am going to begin with. I already have knowledge in coding in python and had done some data science projects as well but it was in a boot camp setup. 
 Anyway, here are some of the projects I have in mind for now:
  
Forex prediction - my problem is I don't have that good foundations in terms of trading.
 Filipino Recipe Recommendation based on Ingredients - I have already scraped the data of their recipes but I don't know what good approach I would do on this one, NLP with Topic Modelling or Deep Learning (I don't have experience on this one yet)
  
Or if you have other topics you can suggest pls I highly appreciate it! Also, is there a community of data science here in the philippines and other community for me to have a collaboration in building data science projects? thank you!

 Long story short - I'm a data analyst for a small retail company. Very small data team (started 2 people, now 4 people). It was really great at first as I would get to touch everything data related (frim data viz to dba to small heuristic models to API development, etc.). However, as a result, I'm feeling stretched all over the place and unable to gain significant knowledge in any area (im slowly learning about each instead of rapidly about one).
 So, I've started looking at the job market and found an interesting job - although one that looked too senior for my current status, and that paid 3x as much as I make (which seems too good to be true).

 That means keeping track of tasks, hours, epics, sprints, etc. in Azure DevOps, kanban board, or some project management tool. 
 Question: how much time do you spend on the project-tracking work compared to your core work? Like, 4 hours a week? 10% or 15%?
 What PM tools do you like or hate? 
 I'm trying to get a sense of what's common. My team use Microsoft TFS, which I find crappy and highly manual. Our manager just scolded us because we didn't enter the tasks properly. But maybe it's normal and I shouldn't complain. 
 Anyway please share your experience with PM tools. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiya All! I am a one man data shop that manages a couple $bn in operational/sales/marketing data. I do it all, from building the architecture to dashboards/analysis. I've been able to manage meetings along with building/ programming by working late when it's quiet to get the bulk of the programming done. This led to nearly 3 weeks of use or lose and countless hours of "volunteer" work. 
 The biggest issue that I'm finding is that people stack my calendar with meetings to explain their great idea, problem set, general request, or they like to call me in to monitor a meeting to offer data driven answers on the spot. 
 How does everyone else manage the balance between meetings and actually making the things? I can't be alone here... right?
 **I absolutely love my job. Love, love, love my leadership who is responsive to suggestions, and my general working environment. I really am looking for a better way to manage the workload between building and people-ing in the work place.... so I can love it more🥰🤣😊

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody,
 I've recently finished my Master's and am currently applying for data scientist/analyst positions. During my studies, I have acquired a decent knowledge of different algorithms, data cleaning, visualization, evaluation, etc. However, I feel like I didn't learn a lot of the fundamentals around any projects. That is, how to properly document code, use virtual environments and version control, etc. Basically, anything that will make a project seem professional and easily usable by others.
 Are you aware of any resources on such best practices? For example, a course dedicated to a bunch of them or individual resources to help me to get a better understanding of how to create a professional project.
 I would appreciate any pointers! :)

 Hello Redditors!
 I wanted to share some practical strategies that you can use to get rich. Whether you're just starting out on your wealth-building journey or you're looking for ways to take your financial situation to the next level, these strategies can help.

This might involve setting a specific financial goal, like saving a certain amount of money or achieving a certain level of income. It's important to have a clear idea of what you want to achieve so that you can stay motivated and focused as you work towards financial success.

Security review of a new architecture takes months. 
 Azure shell is completely disabled. Even for the dev environment!
 The Azure portal is read-only. You can’t actually click a button to make something happen - you can only view the status of an existing asset. Even for dev!
 All work must be performed through dev ops
  
In my personal account, I can use the portal to create assets (VM, app service, etc.) and the Azure shell to work through commands for hosting apps, connecting to data, etc. With the portal read-only and the shell disabled, I would have to somehow use dev ops and CI/CD to work through and debug any challenges. Am I missing something? I am much more of a mathematician than a developer, and this is my only experience with cloud computing at a big company, so this has me baffled.

 I really want to try and preserve (and hopefully contribute) to what's out there currently. I know there has been a large movement to keep open source AI projects alive while these private groups gain momentum.
 Also, this goes out to the mods, but maybe we should have a pinned post with a list of community driven/open source AI that people can download, mess with, and hopefully contribute to?

 I was initially planning on using the Open AI API but it's way to costly and honestly I already wrote the code for it generally and don't feel like I'll improve much as a programmer if I continue by using the API. I'm considering pivoting as a programmer anyways and figured I might as well tackle this head on while using it for my business.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 My company has a strong focus on learning and developing your skills. We have a lot of programs to help with this - for instance, we have courses where people volunteer to teach something they are an expert on, and we get a large learning and development budget to spend individually. 
 We still feel like this falls short of being effective though - primarily because most of our programs lack the depth or hands on experience needed to really develop most of these skills. As a result we’re looking into ways to revamp some of these programs, and I was curious if anybody here could share what does or doesn’t work well within your own companies. Thanks in advance for any discussion!

 I'm trying to downsample this dataset to optimize the algorithm - I'm currently extracting some elements by the date (removing elements with less than 15 days intervals).
 But now, with that sample that I extract, I don't know how to ensure the quality of the data. How can I make sure that I don't lose any important info in the removed elements?
 ​
 TL;DR: How can I ensure the quality of info on downsampling compared with the original data?
 (I can't use correlation because of the different lengths of the original data and the filtered data.)
 (Language is not important, but I'm using Python)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I'm new here and I just want to rant and rave a little! 
 I studied statistics with a minor in programming in college. Afterward, started to work as an analytics campaign manager in a healthcare company. My job covered making sure the architecture was working correctly to using basic algorithms like K-means, and logistic regression to create campaigns to increase cx and sales. My job was very satisfactory in a way as I could see cancer patients struggling less or people would find they had cancer in the early stages and could get treatment before it was late. 
 ​
 Due to financial reasons, I decided to become a data scientist, did a master and found a job in Western Europe. I'm working at a consulting company where I just do the analytics and prepare presentations but all the interesting stuff like creating the solution, and presenting it to the client belongs to other people. I'm just doing my 'numbers magic' - whatever they asked me to do- and they do all the fun stuff. The worst part is whatever I do is just for companies to save money, it doesn't affect people in any way. 
 ​
 I can't go back to my old work because I have to stay in Europe to make the money and send it to my parents. And my visa allows me just to do technical jobs, nothing like marketing, sales etc... 
 ​
 I feel stuck but don't know what to do. I'm not asking for advice or anything, I just wanted to share, to relax a little.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, thanks in advance for your advice.
 I'm trying to determine whether certain product feature improvements increased the number of monthly active users (active is defined as whether the user made a purchase in the last 28 days). We have the ability to A/B test but I'm getting stuck because this MAU metric is a moving window metric. If we run the experiment for exactly 28 days then I think calculating the impact to MAU is easy. But most of the time our experiments run for more or less days than 28 days. Below are a few scenarios to illustrate my point.
 Note: All scenarios are A/B tests where we split our user base into equal treatment and control groups. So far, I've been calculating "MAU Rate", which is the proportion of users who placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment.
  
Scenario 1: Run experiment for exactly 28 days. At the end of 28 days, simply compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order.
 Scenario 2: Run experiment for less than 28 days, say 14 days. At the end of the experiment, compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment. The issue is that this will include days from before the experiment started. If I use only the days during the experiment, then I'm not really measuring MAU since MAU is 28 days and the experiment ran for only 14 days.
 Scenario 3: Run experiment for more than 28 days, say 35 days. At the end of the experiment, compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment. The issue is that this will exclude data from the first 7 days of the experiment. If I use all the days during the experiment, then I'm not really measuring MAU since MAU is 28 days and the experiment ran for 35 days.
  
Does anyone have any advice on how to measure impact to MAU through experimentation? Thank you!
