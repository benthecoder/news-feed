We are heavily using AWS, is there any reason to add DataBricks into the stack or odes SageMaker fill the same role? 
 Thank you :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! I'm working on a project building multi class classifier. As a part of it I'm required to evaluate my machine learning model on different sets of test data. Consider each test data represents a different section/location. 
 However, we want to present a single metric combining the results on all of these location through aggregation. The location specific test data can be of different size and different label distribution. Right now, we average the result obtained for each location. For example final result = average ( acc of location 1 + acc of loc 2 + acc of loc 3) Acc - accuracy. 
 Is there any other way to reflect the dataset size and label distribution while combining results from multiple test data?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I am posting this with a throwaway account.
 I have been recently let go in a round of layoffs from my Supply Chain Data Science job from a F500 retailer that is based in Middle America. 
 I am trying to find resources for a remote job in Data Science or Data Analytics as my experience is somewhere in between the two. 
 I am also willing to relocate if the job fits but remote is preferred. 
 I have almost 5 years DS experience, self taught through the job. A Supply Chain undergrad from a top 3 university in that field and an MBA from a top 10-15 university and about 10 years of professional experience overall. 
 I believe I am also cutting myself short when it comes to salary expectations. The job I just left paid out $100k in TC which at the time, was a decent salary in LCOL city and I was getting a company to pay me to learn in a real world environment instead of the structure of a class room or MOOC. 
 Any advice would be appreciated.
 EDIT
 If I had to relocate it would be to Austin (lived there for before), Nashville, DC, or NYC (all three of those are closer to family).

 Why did the authors choose not to use dropout for ResNets ? Is it because they use L2 regularization(weight decay) and batch normalization which are forms of regularization which can substitute dropout regularization ?

 The price range is up to ~3200$.
 Which one would you recommend? 😊😊
 She is a windows user but has an iphone, so open to mac, but some software she is using like SAS is not optimized for mac, she said.

I don't think that I want to do pentests or bug bounty. I'm more into research. I like to be the one ahead discovering new stuff. But, how do I get there? Who hires someone like that? What do you need to get the role? How is this job for real? So many questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Farmers still exist today but they exist in drastically fewer numbers than two centuries ago. The modern farming machinery and techniques did not replace farmers but made the industry much less labor intensive. 
 Nowadays programming is a labor intensive activity with relative high salaries. AI is introducing the possibility to do this activity, that worldwide cost companies billions of dollars in programmers salaries, much more efficiently.
 In my opinion, this is the goal of companies like OpenAI. They know that they can’t remove humans out of the loop because current AI is not able to substitute all human cognitive capabilities that intervine in a software developer daily job; like talking with the client, figuring out what he wants and translating it to functional requirements. 
 But nonetheless, they think they have a clear shot to make programming a non labor intensive activity like farming is today. 
 Of course, this is a compelling multibillion business opportunity that is attracting increasing capital from the tech and the financial sectors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! So I wasn’t even intending to go for grad school right after my dual BS CS BS DS program, but I found out I would qualify for a full tuition and fee scholarship for UMSI’s MSI program at Michigan. I’d do the big data analytics curriculum full time and finish in the standard 2 years with a required internship in the summer between the first and second year.
 I’m pretty much already fully invested as it’s a free master of science at a top 5 public uni, so I thought I’d ask what y’all think of the situation, particularly the opportunity cost of delaying full professional entry into the field by 2 more years for an at worst tangentially-related graduate degree. Thanks!
 Some other notes: I’d likely be able to fund living expenses comfortably the entire time, and I’m a nontraditional student finishing undergrad in late 20s with some internships as a data analyst and “machine learning engineer” (more like data engineering bleh)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve recently been laid off from my Data Science role in the UK. Currently looking for some ways to make ends meet whilst I look for another full-time role, and was wondering if anyone had some experience with contract or freelance data science work.
 I’m most intrigued to know:
 1) What the best way to find these roles would be. Seems to be quite a few platforms, if I used one I’d be unsure how to choose between them. 2) If this would be appropriate for me. I’ve only got 1.5 years of commercial DS experience post-uni, largely designing models and putting models into production.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to see if I can use an image generator to illustrate a story I am writing. The thing is the story itself is action-packed and dramatic so I thought I could illustrate it instead as a graphic novel generated by AI but I am worried about the consistency an quality of the images. Also, I can't really use passages in the story as a prompt because the generators don't seem to illustrate the scene well. 
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FYI I'm still a student so if there's sth I'm missing and/or misunderstanding, do enlightment me on this topic. Esp. from the perspective of practitioners in the real work setting.
 When it comes to hyperparams tuning, I've always been directed to using GridSearchCV or RandomSearchCV and that's the end of that. However, I've never really felt that those 2 are the best methods as the former seems to be rather arbitrary and the latter, well, simply random. After more research, I found out abt Bayesian optimization and based on my experience using it so far, it's always outperformed GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV.
 If u're a practitioner in the field, do u use Bayesian optimization for hyperparams tuning or not? Is there perhaps a more practical reason as to why/why not? (e.g. from a computing cost perspective, etc.)? Since GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV are so prevalent, it appears that they're the go to method for hyperparams tuning altho they're suboptimal compared to Bayesian optimization - even some practitioners I've managed to ask abt the subject actually do know abt Bayesian optimization as a concept but don't rly use it in production.
 Appreciate ＆ thanks for the insights in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw a poll on r/cscareerquestionsEU which asked the number of weeks SWEs get as vacation in Switzerland. Most people replied 5 and 6 weeks. I guess there's a lot of declared holidays too (~30 days in a year). Unlimited sick leave is common across EU I guess. 
 Which countries have good pay and the highest possibility that I can take a 1 month long block leave (bring completely out of reach)? 
 And which countries or organizations have the highest amount of leaves in general that people do end up taking? I'm going to be doing an MS in AI/DS soon in the US. But can apply to some Unis in EU as well. I'm learning that US wouldn't let me take much leaves. 
 Also any other Careers that let you take 3 weeks to longer than 2 month leaves?😬

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SVMs were covered quite poorly in my Machine Learning course last semester, the teacher quickly glossed over the maths, only ever mentioning the key bits of it like "Langrangian" or "Kuhn-Tucker conditions". Most resources I referred just went "the math is out of the scope of this textbook"
 Now I still have no clue what or how SVMs find the Maximal Margin Hyperplane. I am looking for resources that help me understand. I have no problem sinking some time into learning the maths (I believe it's called optimization theory?) behind it either.
 Thanks!

 To use a Gaussian kernel SVM, we usually normaliz the feature. Which one or few of following options is (are) True?
 a. （I don't quite remember this option. This one I pretty sure is True, but next two I am uncertain about. Can anyone help me remember it?) b. Sometimes some features cannot be normalized like categorical feature. c. Gaussian kernel SVM cannot be done without feature normalization.

 I have 2 semesters left to get graduated in economics and so far the subjects that I enjoyed the most have been econometrics and statistics. In fact, I just finished a DS minor this semester which was pretty enjoyable for me. 
 The thing is, I'm starting to look for bootcamps or self-taught so I could start developing my career in DS as soon as possible, but I'm not sure if this is the right choice. To make it clear, I would 100% finish the degree but maybe not as my first priority if I could get a DS job.
 Would you recommend finishing my degree and then focusing on DS or is it a good choice to prioritize learning DS and trying to get a job?
 Thanks in advance,

I lead the technical efforts at one of the charities in Ukraine; we're now trying to rebuild connectivity for people in some of the areas where much of the civilian infrastructure was destroyed and Starlink® is not a viable option, or perhaps "not-to-be easily scaled option."
The world of long-range Wi-Fi is a wild one!
We are now trying to evaluate the cost of a point-to-point mesh network using commodity hardware, and so far have only experimented with Raspberry hardware to work the antenna, and some Atheros AR9331-based SoC's. The idea is to make a single device that can act as both a relay station, as well as an actual hotspot, it then can be placed in line-of-sight configuration to potentially cover huge areas (the accepted performance would be anywhere from 0.1-1 Mbit/s point-to-point over anywhere from 5-20km. We are aiming to bring the cost of such configuration down to $100 per unit at least. Hopefully, we also wouldn't need to do so and somebody else could do the whole thing for us at a similar price... Where would you start, i.e. with the vendors, as well as the commodity hardware, firmware that should work best for a setup like this? Bonus points; if it can be somewhat be aware of the current happenstance. In terms of bleed from Electronic warfare deployed by the enemy in Ukraine; it has to work hopefully in adversarial environment!
Best regards,
Ilya

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with large datasets or executing complex operations using pandas, you may experience Out of Memory (OOM) errors or long waiting periods for the results.
 Xorbits can be an ideal solution for these issues. Xorbits is a scalable Python data science framework that aims to scale the Python data science stack while keeping the API compatibility. You can get an out-of-box performance gain by changing `import pandas as pd` to `import xorbits.pandas as pd`.
 Compared with other pandas-like solutions, Xorbits offers stronger performance, simpler deployment, and better API compatibility.
 With TPC-H benchmarks at scale factor 100, Xorbits is 7x faster than Dask. For the benchmark results compared to other pandas-like systems, please visit: https://xorbits.io/benchmark

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, 
 Currently working through the IBM DS and Google Analytics certificate. I am a complete rookie in DS.
 I am interested in where linguistics and behavioral economics intersect with data science in terms of the types of jobs/research fields to target as it seems like 'Data Scientist' is somewhat of a catch all term for HR departments. 
 In terms of a following a learning pathway, employers (HR?) seem to all look for a degree, however online postgrad and BsS computer science course seem overpriced and, outside of data science specific programs, not as good as combining bootcamps, certificates and other online learning routes. Is this the case? 
 In terms of building a portfolio of work, or a learning journal that can be linked to CV, does anyone have any recommendations? 
 Many thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I notice a lot of my research at work ends up taking me to methods in information theory or signal processing. I was wondering what graduate college courses in mathematics would be most helpful to me as a data scientist. I have an undergrad in mathematics with calc, linear algebra, probability and statistics, ODE, analysis, etc. but no PDE, information theory, signal processing or graph theory. I also don’t have any courses in advanced or specific statistics courses such as time series analysis, combinatorics, or Bayesian inference—although I’m familiar with the fundamentals from my undergrad probability courses.
 I’m already pretty familiar with most of the models and methods in elements of statistical learning. It’s more about being able to develop or understand novel methods and having a foundational base that prepares me for anything.
