        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wondering what you need to do to attribute a passage that was written by Chat GPT.
 I think it's good for providing a few structured paragraphs on a topic. Say that you use what CGPT produces but then you add a further 50% of your written work on top of the base it provided plus editing every 2nd sentence that CGPT wrote.
 In this hypothetical would you need to attribute / credit CGPT for the work? what license is it published under and what does this mean (ELI5)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for any suggestions. I have a dataset of a few hundred thousand records and need to use some features to properly map to another column (classification) but the column has over 1000 possibilities. Was curious if there is any sort of rules engine that could generate rules based on a few features or if I should just stick with something like a random forest or decision tree. 
 Will also add that most features are text as is the target column, so maybe there could be something in the NLP space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. relatively new data scientist here. I was recently trying to see how to build a model in my situation.
 Basically I have a bus data of past five years that run regularly each day, and bus has all kinds of information including (# of passengers per hour, revenue earned, origin, destination, etc). Then we wanted to increase the frequency of buses running in preparation for some upcoming festivals during this weekend in the regionsome time late 2023. 
  
The question is I need to figure out how many additional riders this additional services (increasing bus frequency) will bring and I was having hard time predicting/figuring out how. 
 Instead of additional bus frequency, let's say we introduce additional taxi boats to take people to the festival, then given two different modes of transportation happening (bus and taxi boat), how do I create a collective model around it? I also have past five years of taxi boat usage data.
  
Any help/advice on how I should approach (or some kind of model I should use, Bayes?) this appreciated because I was thinking all day and a bit stuck. Was thinking of doing some blunt estimated simple math but wans't sure if that's even accurate. Figuring out the effect of what happens when something happens has been challenging.

 I have a review system and I stumble over the fact that I want to make a fair ranking and not just the average. The average is allready calculated but when you are sorting on this average the results are not fair.
 EXAMPLE:
 Company A has an average score of 4.8 based on 5 reviews. Company B has an average score of 4.7 based on 43 reviews.
 If you rank on average score Company A is above Company B in ranking but it ain't fair because it is a lot harder to get a 4.7 based on 43 reviews.
 I want to create a number that is based on the average review score and the number of reviews that are submitted.
 Maybe I am wrong here for asking this question but what is the best formula to create such an average and wich values do I need for creating this?
 I am developing in PHP if this should be important for you to know.
 I allready found something like this based on the bayesian average, is this Something that I should use?

 The sky was a deep shade of black as the group of friends made their way to the cabin, the only light coming from the beams of their headlights piercing through the heavy rain. The cabin, located deep in the woods, was said to be haunted, but the friends brushed off the rumors as nothing more than tales meant to scare. As they settled in for the night, they laughed and joked, telling ghost stories and watching horror movies. They passed jokes about how they would run if they saw a ghost, unaware of the danger lurking outside. But their laughter was cut short when Dave stumbled across a letter in the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was offered to work on a project as a freelancer/independent contractor. I'm having trouble coming up with the pay rate. 
 The project involved a dataset of 8k rows x 351 columns of data. I'm supposed to structure this data set differently to fit a Salesforce template they have. This would increase the rows by about 3x, but reduce the columns to about 50. They told me they would consider doing this manually, but they know that it can be done with a python script (which is where I come in). 
 I have no idea how long this is gonna take me, since the data is pretty sensitive & old. It goes back to 17 years and it seems to be poorly maintained. 
 Anyone have any idea on how I can start pricing this? Or suggestions/things to consider? TIA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a little more than a year into my first data analyst job and recently graduated with an MS in Data Science. The program was great and I feel comfortable saying that I'm probably at about an intermediate level given my degree and work experience. However, I'll also say that while the program gave me a good understanding of a lot of different subdomains of the field, it didn't necessarily allow me to become an expert in one particular subject matter. 
 I know a big part of being successful in this field is research, continuous education, and being aware of new technology and advancements in the field. I'm looking into subscribing to an online education platform and wanted to know A) is this common for someone of my level? and B) what platforms should I look into? 
 For context, I have experience with all of the major names - DataCamp, Dataquest, Udacity, Udemy, and Coursera. I get the impression that the first three I named are geared much more towards beginners and probably aren't necessary for me. I like Udemy for the ability to buy classes on demand and keep them for life though I feel like some classes can be hit or miss. Coursera Plus is on the pricier side ($200 a year), but getting access to classes by college level professors could be beneficial. 
 Just wanted to throw this out there and ask if there's other platforms or educators I should be looking into. Thanks!

 My background is in mathematics and so far I’ve been focusing on learning the fundamentals of ML, CV, NLP to a reasonable standard. Also have used AWS and Azure a bit.
 My main problem is I have no idea how to use GitHub or how to deploy a model to production. Not sure if there is anything else I show be learning too like computer science fundamentals. 
 Please can you recommend topics and resources for what you think I should be learning next? Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm putting together a trivia night, and one idea I have for a round is "The Pen*s Game" where I replace a word from a famous movie quote with the word "pen*s". I could simply replace it with my own voice, but I don't think it would sound as good/be as funny, so I think it would be amazing to instead use a tool (presumably AI-powered) to achieve this.
 Is there a reasonably user-friendly way of doing this?Ideally it would be some magical tool that has a nice GUI and celebrity voices already trained, though I doubt this exists... I am well-versed in Python, and am always looking to learn new tools, but I don't have the time to scrape voice data for each actor and train a model (not that I even know where I'd start on that front).
 As an example, imagine this clip from Shrek except "parfait" is replaced with "pen*s".
 https://youtu.be/-FtCTW2rVFM?t=86 
 I don't know this threads rules, so I censor "pen*s" just in case. Any suggestions would be appreciated! Thank you.

 It's $50 for 3 months and he has a bunch of courses on the website. He keeps talking about how most ML jobs are just SQL and Python - I am unable to judge how true this is because I have zero exposure to the field.
 I haven't been able to find any reviews on Mike West or Logikbot. Does anyone here have any idea if this is a reliable guy and would you recommend signing up for his courses?

I had this weird idea lately, with the rise of AI to the mainstream, to implement some kind of "Simulator", where one could input a webcam picture, some basic info through a form, & get an alternate small narrated video narrated of one's future. I'm looking for suggestions for open source AI APIs I could use for it. My idea, very simplistically put, is to combine them through input, outputs and some basic logic manipulation. I'm also looking for recommendations for the stack I could use. I've worked with NodeJS and Java w/ Spring Boot on backend, & Angular for frontend. Any recommendations based in the APIs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[around 3 years ago I was trying to make a TTS AI model, I got the entire dataset, audio voice lines, transcript, the whole thing, I had everything setup in Python and I was using linux.
 The issue was I had a GTX 1080 and I wasn't using any cloud services to train the Model, it would take me around 2 weeks of non-stop computing to get it to work, So I was stuck with experimenting doing it a few hours at a time.
 So now I want to actually do it for real, however the Friend that was a python expert helping me, we are no longer in contact, and I do not know jack about Python or coding.
 So Redditors, Please tell me what I can do to take my Dataset/WaveRNN thingy that I have setup both on my Windows PC or my Linux PC, and how do I use Microsoft/Nvidia cloud computing to train my TTS model within hours instead of weeks?
 The Final product I am aiming for is:
 Me writing Text into a promt, and it will generate a TTS voice just like the voice I am trying to make, and eventually be able to use it on Twitch.tv for fun or in-game.
 It would be similar to how Twitch Streamer Forsen uses multiple different TTS voices.
 Thanks in advance

 I have 2.5 years of quantitative finance and algorithmic trading experience and also ran the trading club at my university for 4 years.
 Yes, I know that I could go back to finance, but I want a new challenge with a better WLB. 
 Would these 6.5 years of QF and AT be considered as relevant job experience? Should I add my projects to my DS-related GitHub and portfolio?

 I had this interview today. It is one of the most prestigious banks in my country. Tbh questions were pretty basic. And i failed to answer them througly since i havent used them. what made me happy is I almost did it. All the questions asked were thr things that bothet my mind and i was looking for a chance to actually deal with them during real projects. Not just reading about them. Because there is a lot on my plate rn. (non CS background ) 
 I realized I was stressed out at first but then I realized i really enjoy the questions. This is a first for me. I really enjoy this field and working feels like solving puzzles. I just wanted to share this. I am already feeling too old (29m) but I like that i am sure this is what i would like to do.

I found some toy-like phone apps with very limited sets. The best more professional tool I was able to find was Photoshop's neural filters. They were introduced already a couple of years ago, so one would think more advanced specialized tools for this purpose would exist already. Are there such tools? Did my google-fu just fail?

 Have you found any application of AI in the construction industry (notwithstanding the design/modelization)? 
 I've been following the industry for ages and I believe there is so much to be done particularly with AI as it can manage dependancies.. 
 I've quite a few ideas too; get in touch if you are interested to discuss over this :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a project i’m working on, there will be two live video feeds coming from a drone each.they obviously won’t be in the same exact position but the Video will show the approximate same area, with some differences in angle and video quality. I want drone A to guide drone B to a target that was visually identified. Approach angle towards the target should be variable. Is there a AI that can compare these two video feeds and determine the position of drone B by the Angle of it’s live video and then based on that guide it into the target? This should be a purely visual thing and not GPS-Style. 
 What I was thinking is maybe drone A (with higher Picture Quality) spots something next to a tree. Drone B sees the same tree and the AI determines it is the same one, concluding that the target (wich is given to it by drone A) is right next to it. Then it flies towards the Target, only based on Visual Recognition.
 Questions; Does such an AI exist? How complex is it? How efficient/safe is it?
 I will answer additional questions if necessary. Thank you in Advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m feeling so lost here guys. Back in the spring I signed up for Merit America’s Data Analyst program and finished in November. I’ve been putting out applications like crazy and not a word back on anything.
 On one hand this part isn’t a shock, it lines up with everything I’ve been told about what to expect. But somehow I’m still losing my mind here. 
 All I ever wanted was a job that pays well and that I can get out of bed in the morning for. Data seemed great. I guess I was naive because I wasn’t expecting all this added career development networking LinkedIn bs to be a part of it. 
 I see people on Reddit saying that I’m probably not going to get a data job first thing, on account of zero experience. No, you have to “get your foot in the door” doing god knows what else in some other job and hope you can spend enough time looking at a spreadsheet to put it on your resume using flowery hyperbolic marketing horse s. What other job am I supposed to apply for? I’m in data because I don’t have any other skills! This was my last god forsaken hope. 
 I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. Career development is so f’d. I don’t care about any of this, I just need money and to not spend 40 hrs a week wishing I was unconscious. Why is this so hard.
