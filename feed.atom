 I just completed one year at my job. I’m gonna keep things really vague. It’s at a small organization. I work with a lot of attorneys. We do a lot direct client services, and we do a lot of public policy work. I have a technical background in biosci. When I was hired, they asked me to take care of some data stuff. Now i do a lot of data work. I taught myself python / pandas pretty well. I’ve worked with tableau. I’ve built scrapers. I’ve uncovered insights. I’ve communicated my work. I’ve helped customize a new CRM. I’ve designed new workflows. I also take care of a lot of the other tech needs of the org.
 I’m not quite sure exactly what I would call my job title at this point. I understand fairly well that I could be geared to become a Data Analyst…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To evaluate the performance of the KNN algorithm (using Euclidean distance metric), implement a leaveone-out evaluation routine for your algorithm. In leave-one-out validation, we repeatedly evaluate the algorithm by removing one data point from the training set, training the algorithm on the remaining data set and then testing it on the point we removed to see if the label matches or not. Repeating this for each of the data points gives us an estimate as to the percentage of erroneous predictions the algorithm makes and thus a measure of the accuracy of the algorithm for the given data. Apply your leave-one-out validation with your KNN algorithm to the dataset for Question 1 c) for values for K of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 and report the results.

 I’m not really versed in A.I or deepfake technology. My question is, with the democratization of this sort of tech, how can platforms or developers themselves prevent these kinds of videos from getting exposure, and possibly harming people? Can certain demographics be preyed on with this kind of tech?

The code contains python packages such as graphql to extract the data and sqlalchemy to inject the data into the database. I’m trying integrate this code into beam api, but I have no clue how to do so. Do I have to generate the data first and then use the csv output for my pipeline or can I just insert all of this into a beam pipeline and extract the csv by executing the apache beam code? Any help is extremely appreciated thank you for reading.

 We have a ID (let’s call it Pseudo ID) which represents a customer, that has their session(s) as another ID inside of it. 
 We’re seeing about 4% of the sessions have the same Pseudo ID. We think it’s because it’s the same customer switching between desktop and mobile devices, but hard to tell.
 Should we exclude the duplicate Pseudo IDs? The lift of the experiment is positive if you include or exclude them, but the variance is about 5% between the results. 
 How would you look at this? Include the duplicate IDs, or exclude them?

Operational Research and Applied Statistics where I did time series forecasting, supply chain modelling, Credit risk churn models, Financial risk analysis and math behind hypothesis tests and more statistics. I did my dissertation with govt predicting property values where I used XGBoost. I am really confident with python and I believe I can learn anything If I put the time and effort. Though I am finding it hard to find my first job because of lack of experience. I'm planning to enhance my learnings in Data visualization like PowerBI which I used in dissertation though I didn't have much idea on it. What do you think I should learn or do for increasing my chances of getting hired. I almost all the time pass the numerical and logical assessments companies offer but Im having a hard time finding my foot into the industry. I wish I could do work for free for a month or so and make them believe I can learn stuff.

I am at a New Zealand university (top 150 in all three fields, top 100 worldwide). 
 A lot of my interested overlap with data science, but focusing down on it would require me to neglect a lot of other interests.
 My interests include;
  
Parallel/distributed computing and algorithms
 Algorithm design and analysis, proof of correctness, etc.
 AI (interested, but never worked adequately with)
 Business Analytics
 Probability, stochastic calculus, modelling
 Data collection, data engineering
 Systems designs - e.g. distributed web crawlers, the specifics behind obscure stuff like link shorteners.

 I work for a fortune 15 company. We work for internal stakeholders and try to build an ML use case around their problems. We work in a team of 3-4 people, we call it a pod. Our pod consists of DS, DE, BA, Data Visualization engineer, and product owners from the business side.
  
Do you typically work in this structure?
 For DS to succeed, what do you think, how important is it to have a great supporting team (DE, BA etc.)?
 Are there pros and cons of it you can think of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got a scholarship to do a MSc in health data science but its an applied program and has no math. It also has no databasing or data management course. SQL isnt covered at all. 
 Im wondering if I should skip on it. The alumni tell me its no good for people who are already professionals and I am already a professional epidemiologist with a fair amount of stats background. 
 Is it worth it? I mean theres the opportunity cost obviously. I lose a year of life and income, and then Im forced to remain in my third world country for 2 years after. It is offerred by a so called top 35 world University in the UK but the omissions are very strange. I do not know R, Python, machine learning, AI, etc
 CLIFF: I am wondering if in the opinion of data scientists out there if the ommission of math and data management would be a complete deal breaker for you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'll keep this short. I learned and had been using R for Data Science. Unfortunately R has fallen out of favor, and I clearly see the vast majority of organizations moving to Python if they have not already.
 How do I transition and get into Python? I have zero experience with it. I'm a bit of a throwback statistician who's previously used SPSS and SAS at various points, plus some propriety tools. My background and interest is more on the statistics side in general, less on computer science.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just figured the explanation that I added with question wasn't posted. So, here's the scenario:
 We open sales of a product begining of the Fall every year. Now that we have data collected about the customers and their transactions, we are trying to predict customer level probability of purchasing the product before Fall - ideally each week of Summer to use that to customize promotional campaign. 
 What we are planning to do is get historic data snapshots as of the end of Summer, train model on this data. Thhen from the next Summer use this model to predict the outcome of the Fall purchase. Now the question was basically, does it sound like a sound technique to use this end of Summer model to predict during the Summer? Or should we train separate models for each week of Summer - so basically for each weekly model we'd get historic data snapshots as of the end of that week rather than end of the whole Summer and train the models separately.

 One question is should I be taking the raw values or taking the difference between time steps? What are some other approaches for accounting for non-stationary features?

 And honestly I have no idea what to do going forward. Everyone there is accountant and a few economics background. But no one with a statistics or math background to my knowledge. 
 So basically they have given me a list of every audit they have done for the last ten years. And want me to find a way to help them choose vouchers to audit that are more likely to be inappropriate. 
 I have a bunch of data, the vendor, the payments amount, how long did they look at the voucher before they approved it. And everything you can think of. I just have no idea the best method to use. I was just thinking of doing logistic regression, but I don’t know if you guys have any better suggestions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Comic Code is a monospaced adaptation of Comic Sans. Designed specifically for programming, which is a corner of typography that involves intensive typing that feels more akin to handwriting than typesetting, this typeface took inspirations from the friendly characteristics and low-resolution legibility of Comic Sans. It is an unapologetic admittance of the positives of the source design, and a literal manifestation of “code like nobody’s watching”. Comic Code only takes inspiration from Comic Sans and was drawn entirely from scratch, in case you are wondering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, I’m employed as a data scientist, but primarily manage small teams and work with management on data strategy. It’s not an optimal layout, but I’m enjoying this, “management / strategy” aspect. 
 I might not be perfectly equipped to apply for data science manager roles, so I’ve come to ask for a your opinion. 
 What are your thoughts on the data science manager position: what skills are necessary, how does it differ to senior data science positions, and any personal experiences?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you deal with changing features in a regression problem? I imagine this is quite common in a product/marketplace company. Here's an example:
 Let's say the task is predicting car prices for an online marketplace, a value you'd like to present to someone about to list their car on the site. You can use your marketplace's historic sales as a training set. However, as the marketplace evolved, more features were added to the car object, and maybe some stopped being used. E.g., in the early phase of the marketplace, you had 3 features: car model, year, and color. Then maybe later on the company stopped collecting color, and instead now collect MPG and transmission type. So now you have 4 features on the newer dataset: car model, year, MPG, and transmission type. And so on and so on...did you just impute the missing values? not use features that are missing data? Split test/train to only reflect current features? Is it a constant game of cat and mouse keeping up with the fresh features?
