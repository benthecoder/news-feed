 Shiny and JavaScript
 Shiny has become the status quo of building web apps/dashboards with R. A major reason of its success is that you don't need to know javascript to create basic interactive web apps. 
 Although the concealment of this important feature is by design and makes Shiny in the first instance easy to use, in the long run when you want to build serious and more visual appealing apps, you most likely need to utilize javascript to make most of the web framework. 
 Learning javascript doesn’t only benefit your shiny apps, the new acquired skill set can be applied to other R web frameworks as well, such as OpenCPU or used outside the R spe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The topic of data recovery from broken phones seems to be a prime target from SEO optimised blogspam so I'm posting here in hopes that someone had a similar issue in the past and may be able to help me out.
I am tasked with restoring some photos from a Huawei P30 that has a broken screen/touchpad. The photos were stored on the device directly, unfortunately not on an SD card or on a cloud provider. The phone does still turn on (it vibrates when plugged into a power outlet and shows up on Windows). However, it's only showing an installer for HiSuite (which did not help), not the file system. USB debugging is enabled.
Things I tried so far and didn't work:
- shining a flashlight at the screen to see if only the backlight is broken (it seems the whole screen is done for)
- eyeballing it and trying to blindly enter the passcode
- connecting phone to external monitor and keyboard via USB-C -> HDMI (monitor stays black)
Is there anything that may still have a chance of working short of replacing the screen to unlock the phone? Thanks and happy holidays.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello dear Data Science community! 
 I am an uprising folk who wants to dive into the ML world. I have over two years of experience in software engineering and university math base(L.A, probability, calc). I started my journey by taking the Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng, and I successfully completed it! Meanwhile, I was contributing to my little GitHub repo, where I was re-implementing basic ML algorithms and related tools from scratch(Linear/Logistic regression, trees, neural nets, normalizations, optimizers, etc.). My plan for the next months is to practice my ML skills on Kaggle and then actively engage in building an actual ML project or even become active in my undergraduate research.
 The question:
 Recently, I started with a basic Titanic problem as means to start learning and practicing. However, now I wonder what is the best way to approach the Kaggle problems to maximize my learning output? What is a good methodology to solve Kaggle's problems? Are there any great step-by-step instructions on what I should focus on before trying the model? What should I focus on? 
 My findings so far about the question:
 What I have learned so far is that I think it is dumb to simply pick and try ML models without understanding your data. Right now, I am trying to apply for EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis(trying to learn some trends, visualize the data, draw some conclusions)), and based on that, I believe I might feature engineer some data, or maybe get rid of some features completely, and only then to start picking models. However, I wonder, is it the best way to do it? Moreover, how do I conduct a great EDA? How useful is it? Are there any other steps I might need to do before or after EDA, Data Engineering, and finally, model picking?

 I'm currently studying master's in physics (23) and considering taking a gap year to find what I really want to do and have a break from all of that theoretical stuff. But I really don't know where to start!
 It's a complicated situation, yet here is a summary: I have a good level of python and during undergrad worked with many libs for statistics projects +know some machinelearning and did some personal projects +I was fascinated by deep learning and neural networks (i generally like biotechnology and the concept of mimicking nature) , and did a course on it but never used it on a serious project. also, I always have seen app(or software) developers around me and think it is such a fun and demanding career.
 long short, I'm desperately in need of advice and will appreciate it if anybody can help me survive through this :)
 thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks!
 I want to update my Software Engineering resume to my ML Engineering Resume. Still, I wonder if I should even keep some of the software engineering skills/projects/courses I have taken.
 I have over two years of experience in Mobile and Server-side programming.
 On my resume, I have mentioned multiple work experiences(Android Engineer, Full Stack Mobile Engineer, Mobile Researcher, etc.), skills(Java, Android, iOS, CI/CD, Testing, Cloud, Databases, MVVM, Clean Architecture, etc.), courses taken(Spring Boot, Android, iOS, etc.), projects done(full stack e-commerce app, charity app, etc.)
 Now, as I am switching to the ML field, I want to update my resume to mention essential experiences, skills, projects, and research papers regarding Machine Learning. However, as you can see, my previous resume has a lot of stuff related to iOS, mobile, and backend in the skills/experiences/projects/courses sections.
 The question is, do I need to keep all non-ML but programming courses/skills/projects/experiences on my new resume? Or should I altogether leave only the ones that relate to Machine Learning?

For example, I know Georgia’s OSMA program has a micro masters you complete with eDX that would take 3 classes off the list of requirements. Ideally looking for one that uses Python over other languages. Thanks!

I try to apply what I am learning to get more from my education but are there any alternatives that I should work on to keep up with those already working in the field on the civilian side? 
 What projects do you suggest to help keep the skill sets sharp?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been an industry data scientist for 6 years in fintech and gaming.
 In fintech, I sensed a need for interpretability and robustness. Also, I was not working with a lot of data(~500k observations to train models). Consequently, I got into the habit of building tree-based models by default, specifically xgboost. Used explainability techniques such as shap to explain models. 
 After moving to online gaming, the scrutiny is less and the scale is far more. I now have the freedom to use deep learning. I need to be able to demonstrate the effectiveness using experiments, but beyond that, do not need explainability at a granular level. Advantages I see with using deep learning-
  
Custom loss functions - basically any differentiable loss function can be trained on. This has huge advantages when the business goal is not aligned with the loss functions out of the box
 Learning Embeddings - The ability to condense features into dense, latent representations which can be used for any number of use cases
 Multiple outputs per model - tweaking the architecture
  
See all this, Deep learning seems to offer a lot of advantages, even if the performance might be similar to tree-based methods. What do you guys think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
 ​
 For context, I'm blind. I loved video games when I was younger, but can't really play them all that much anymore now that I have lost all eyesight. There are some text based games that I can get into in the way of MUDs, and there are also some fighting games I can play, and a couple games that do have mods which make them fairly playable.
 ​
 While this is great, the selection of games for me to play is extremely low because of this.
 ​
 What I'm imagining though would be game changing for me, and would give me several hours, days, years of enjoyment. I'm thinking of a project that would use a large language model, such as ChatGPT, combined with some sort of sound generation AI, as well as text to speech AI, to create an experience similar to that of a MUD, but full of atmospheric…]]></summary>
