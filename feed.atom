        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to create signature recognition, they have two input sources, one is the signature in plain paper the other is the signature from ID Card. 
 Currently my preprocessing for plain paper is converting to gray, using HSV threshold to remove, remove noise by blurring, cropping with boundingRect
 This has the benefits that all input will have the same format. But Is it too much, or maybe can cause it to unable to generalize?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a project where we have users that perform a series of actions in a specific order, every day. I also have the delay between each action
 If I know that at least a know of subset of users do not perform a fraudulent action. What is a possible way to know which users are fraudulent or at least start an investigation.
 I have many ideas but I don't know where to start and not sure my ideas make sense. Here they are:
 - create a markov chain using the historical data and tag users that do a series of action with low probability
 - create the markov chain and cluster it in one way or another (dont know how yet), then tag users that do not belong to a certain cluster
 - create a markov chain and use a graph neural network to do some sort of classification (dont know how I will proceed without labels)
 Can you please guide me, provide ressources or any kind of feedback or concept that can help me move forward. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, so I have a dataset with 8000 rows and 200+ features, mostly numerical. By looking at summary statistics, I see that a good chunk of these features (100ish) have zeroes for 75%+ of their entries. Seems to me like all these zeroes won't contain any useful info for an eventual model, and it would simplify my process a lot to reduce the dimensionality. Would it be wise to simply remove features like this and continue on my way or would I be missing out on lots of possible info? Maybe take all of these sparse columns and use PCA to hopefully reduce them to one or two principal components?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a concept in graph theory, in particular when talking about tournaments, known as a median order, which is essentially an ordering of the vertices that maximizes the amount of edges pointing in the increasing direction with respect to the ordering.
 This can be thought of multiplying the adjacency matrix by a permutation matrix on the right and on the left, such that the sum of the upper triangular part of the matrix is maximal.
 I've coded it as an integer program github link here, but the problem is really slow. I've been thinking if maybe it could be done with some sort of reinforcement learning procedure, where you'd input the adjacency matrix of the graph and it orders the rows/columns in such a way that maximices the upper triangular sum.
 Is this a viable strategy or is this one of those places where ML does not apply? Is there any good reference for trying to solve integer optimization problems with ML?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have been trying to scrap the school schedule (for obvious reasons, of course). And so far, I saw coursicle claims that they get the data from "Smith's public listing course". I've tried to find it but no use, then I found a reddit post from the cofounder of coursicle himself saying that he ping the school gateway (https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/r0datq/where_does_coursicle_get_its_class_seats_data_from/). I'm not sure whether I understand his idea right, but I can't find any way to access my school schedule without actually have to login in, which is a big deal when employ bot to server. So do you have any suggestion, or have any source that has college's courses available publicly, please let me know. Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! 
 I've been pretty excited reading about all the advancements in LLMs over the years but never took the time to dip my toes in. I'm also a PC gamer and waited until the gpu market dipped a bit to finally buy a RTX3080 and figured might as well get into some hobbyist ML/deep learning experimentation with a new GPU with so many CUDA cores. 
 I'm aware its still nothing in comparison to an A100 or the like and that I might still be fairly limited working with any LLM, but wondering if anyone has any experience, tips or guidance on what's possible without a multi-gpu at-home setup, like what's the biggest model one could play with on a single 3080, what to expect in terms of process time per token, the biggest feasible model one could or should use to fine tune on a closed domain dataset, etc. 
 If I'm being completely unrealistic in even attempting to fine-tune an LLM locally, please also feel free to clear me of any dilusions. 
 Regardless, it's still so fascinating to see all the developments in the space happening so quickly. This is a super exciting time we're living in, and hopefully these kinds of technologies will be more accessible to hobbyists as they're developed to require less compute and consume less energy.
 Thanks in advance for any guidance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(I apologize in advance if this is the wrong forum for my question. I'm not entirely sure where to direct it.)
 Background:
 I'm a business professor in Boston, and I expect to be awarded tenure this spring. I also expect my teaching and service demands to reduce quite a bit in the next year. I would like to use this sudden flexibility to begin developing my technical and data skills, which are severely lacking. I am fine with a long-term pursuit (2+ years). I teach undergraduate analytics, but in a very applied and simple way (e.g., Google Analytics, SPSS, linear regression, binary logistic regression, cluster analysis, etc.).
 What I'm looking for:
 My priorities in developing a side hustle are as such (in this order):
  
Gain career flexibility. My PhD currently limits me to academia.
 Gain some opportunities for freelance consulting.
 Improve my capacity to build interesting datasets that could help my research and my students.
 Develop a more visible skillset that I can publicly showcase (this is understandably vague). Long-term ambitions are to build more of an online presence oriented around an in-demand skillset.
  
Ideas:
 Some areas that I am brainstorming:
  
Machine Learning (Not sure what this industry looks like, so may be a naiive idea)
 Data engineering (could help me build unique datasets, but would not have access to servers)
 Web development
 Data visualization
 Data science (I understand that some of the topics above fall under this category)
  
All of these topics have equal intuitive appeal to me. My problem is that I do not fully understand the dynamics of these industries, as I've been tucked away in my academic bubble plugging away at my personal research projects. I am looking to break out of this bubble a bit, while also holding onto the security it provides (not looking to leave academia anytime soon).
 Would love any insights you may have to offer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently working to address customer churn among deposit accounts of a retail bank. In this case, the churn is not explicitly defined since a customer- either an individual, or a corporate entity, both using the account primarily to fulfil business related transactions- is free to deposit or withdraw any amount at any point in time.
 I am inclined towards approaching this as an anomaly detection problem rather a classification one: i.e., identify customers as likely to churn by detecting anomalous patterns in their behaviour such as frequent, increasing withdrawals and/or declining credits?
 I would like to hear your opinion on this. Also, if you could cite any approach/existing solution for a similar problem. I am currently reading up on the following that considers hierarchical Temporal Memory Approach to address churn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello,
 I'm planning on using the shortened version of the schwartz value survey (SSVS) in my master's thesis. there are 10 basic human values and participants rate each of them on a likert-scale (0 to 8). I will later relate this survey data to some behavior of the participants (like "participants who value conformity behave like this") -but, I am completely lost on how to analyze the survey data. I guess I need to create a score for each participant, but is it possible? or logical? (values have a circumplex structure -each value is similar to one other while also being the opposite of another. so yielding just one score per individual seems like it wouldn't make sense? like they would cancel each other out somehow? i don't know)
 using factor analysis, the 10 values can be reduced into a couple (?) of dimensions (I guess). but would that lead to a score? or a score with two dimensions (like a point coordinate in xy-axis)? 
 does anybody have any clue? help.........please?

 In order to manage impacts from climate change and other threats, researchers urgently need to learn more about the ocean's inhabitants, ecosystems, and processes. As scientists and engineers develop advanced robotics that can visualize marine life and environments to monitor changes in the ocean's health, they face a fundamental problem: The collection of images, video, and other visual data vastly exceeds researchers' capacity for analysis.
 FathomNet is an open-source image database that uses state-of-the-art data processing algorithms to help process the backlog of visual data. Using artificial intell…]]></summary>

 I hope you are doing well.
 Would you please tell me the difference between the Retention and the Propensity models?
 As I understand, the propensity model has three types: Propensity to buy, Propensity to churn, and Propensity to unsubscribe.
 Is the retention model the same as the propensity to churn?
 Thank you in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been out of programming practice and not feeling very motivated for building something real, so I’m looking for programming games that are fun. I’ve tried a few, I think I’d like something that has a REPL or notebook interface as well as or instead of a file-based interface.
Here are some I’ve tried:
Using a general-purpose programming language:
bitburner - this is quite fun, though there’s quite a lot going on
hackmud - this seems fun and interesting, though the community is small now. This was my introduction to JS dependency hell.
Special purpose languages:
The many Zach-likes - I’ve enjoyed these a lot, but I want something a bit more open than puzzle-y
Else.heart.break - This was quite fun, but a very slow start and then I broke the quest triggers by skipping right to the end of the game once I got the hacking device.
colobot a cool classic educational programming game where you’re an astronaut controlling lots of robots - I remember the missions feeling a lot easier to solve without much programming, but apparently there’s a new mission pack…
Anyway! Interested to hear your recommendations!]]></summary>
