        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One claim I hear a lot in AI circles is that in the future AI will replace a lot of bullshit jobs, which will free up time for humans to focus on what matters. No more transcribing emails for a living. New, meaningful jobs will be created instead. In other words, the hope is that in 10 years more people will be psychologically happy with their jobs than today. 
 I'm growing wary of the opposite risk. 
 If we consider "bullshit" the part of a job that can be automated away, then sometimes the bullshit part of a job is what makes it pleasurable and fulfilling (provided it is not the only thing). As an artist you may draw pleasure in doing coloring after a pencil sketch. As an engineer, you may like a day without planning or meetings where you can focus on programming a small piece of code. As a blog post writer you may enjoy, well, writing. 
 AI are quickly becoming able to replace all these tasks, and to stay competitive people will increasingly be required to offload parts of their jobs to them. I can see a future where jobs in any field start looking the same - the person is in charge of having higher knowledge about the problem, planning tasks for AI, be able to evaluate AI output, and assemble final product. This is certainly not a bullshit job, but I also think that for many people this is not going to be a fulfilling job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently working at a trading desk in an asset manager firm. The pay is good but I grew to learn that the finance / macroeconomics side of my job is not what drives me the most. I realized what I enjoy the most is the technical / coding / data analysis or wrangling side of my job. The thing is I don't really know what habilities should I develop to land a decent paying job as data analyst or data engineer.
 Most of the tasks at my current job involves building automated reports and managing a database with information on what has been traded by the portfolio managers, performing risk analysis and calculating P&L of trades.
 The system that I developed is based on R, Rmarkdown (for reports) and is feeded from an SQL database that I also manage. I also have some fluency on python but but I have less experience on it.
 I also manage a systematic portfolio based on some regressions in order to recognize trends. But it's probably going to be taken from me, so I'll loose this fun project.
 My background is on electrical engineering (bachelor) in one of the best universities at my country although I was not a great student...
 So in my view I have something to show in order to persue a career in this field but I lack knowledge in the specific technologies more relevant than just basic coding and querying / updating / maintaining a database.
 I'm kinda lost and don't know where to start. Is Data Engineering too far of a jump? I feel like I would be prepared for a data analytics job but it seems not to be that well paying.
 What kind of skills do I need to develop for those jobs?
 Also, I'm 27 and turning 28 in March. Am I too old for this transition? Should I just stick with finance? My fear with sticking with it is that i won't have the passion to keep studying and progressing on the career.

 Life's priorities after age 30 being what they are, I [currently] really can't summon enough energy to learn on a regular basis outside of work.
 It's a good sign to me that there's other things in my life apart from work and learning but I'm curious, how do you guys and gals approach learning?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have heard that art AI converts images into "noise" to create their models.
 Question: Can you revert the "noise" into the image it was based into?
 E.G I take the mona lisa, convert it into "noise" so the AI can understand it.
 Can I then request the AI to use the mona lisa "noise" to generate the mona lisa back again?
 Or there is no way to return it back to the image after it is converted into noise? (not the exact image, but its equivalent based into the noise stored).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I paused my Bachelor's degree in Marketing almost a year ago to pursue an education in a technology field. I chose Data Science and I loved it!
 However, in my country, no university (that I could pay, at least) would offer a data centered course, so I decided to enroll in a Data Science course provided by a major technology school over here. It's not an university, but the school is great! It's recognized by not only big companies in the market, but even by the government itself as a professionalizing school. 
 I'm going to graduate on my data science course by July this year and I was told by my teachers that starting to look for jobs would be a good idea, and so I did. 
 I could look for jobs in my home country (many great opportunities around) but what I actually want is an international opportunity (better payment, even more opportunities in major companies, maybe a chance to live abroad for a few years, among other reasons). However, every job post I've seen so far requires you a Bachelor's degree in at least a related area.
 If I show them I have a degree (Not a bachelor's degree level one, but still a degree issued by an actual educational institution) and show them a good portfolio, show them I have the skills, etc, would I still have hiring chances? 
 I know a good amount of people who work in tech and have no Bachelor's degree and are not even enrolled to get one. I was under the impression that the Data market wouldn't be different, that it is in so much need for professionals that maybe companies wouldn't be so picky when they found a professional with the skills set and work ethics they're looking for, but I wanted to hear from international professionals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm new to Data Science and I'm going to have an interview on Monday for a Python Backend Developer of Data products (the job description also mentions Pandas and FastAPI). I'll be answering some technical questions and do some live coding. 
 I asked the interviewer if he could go into detail about what will be asked and he said they will explore my "knowledge to industrialize one data product in Python".
 I know I'm new to this, but I've never heard about this concept. At first, I thought he could mean something to do with deployment, but it's for a developer position. I believe this is not an industry term and maybe he meant something else that I'm not getting.
 Does anyone know exactly what this means? I would also appreciate if some of you could share some tips for the interview.
 Thank you all in advance!

 I'm looking for AI software that can do the following tasks:
 A fully automated chat bot that can be used to close deals.
 A telephone bot that can do outreach and also sense if a lead is interested or not.
 Basically I want to be able to automate the whole outreach + close process by AI so that I can process much more contact data as human sales reps could ever do. 
 If a lead is interested, they should receive a link with an offer where they can directly purchase the digital product that I'm planning to sell.

 While I love the thought of DS, machine learning and working with data, people say that you need to do at least a masters for entry level DS jobs and even if you do, the pay isn't as good as SWE without a masters.
 Can anyone give any pointers to help me decide what to do in the future?
 Current Location : India
 Preferable location for masters if the moment arrives : UK. Thought of US first but it's easier to get citizenship in UK and I like the culture.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Historically, job hopping has looked pretty bad on resumes but recently it’s become pretty normal in this industry. 
 What is considered ok for time between jobs and what raises alarms? It seems like it’s pretty common for people to land entry level analyst jobs and use that to take the step to DS after 8-12 months. I’d imagine most people leave this position after 2 or so years to get mid level or senior positions. 
 To all the hiring managers/senior level folks out there at what point does job hopping scare you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am 30, currently working as a data engineer for a product company. The team I work with has data scientists and I support them by building etl pipelines. As I am 30 now, I am worried what my career trajectory is going to be. I started as a Business analyst then learnt some python and moved to data engineering.
 Things I like/dislike about data engineering - 1) just do you task, build pipelines and it is systematic. 2) absolutely hate oncalls - I work weekends, have to get up at night regularly to fix bugs every 4 weeks. It is tiring and not sure how it will affect me when I have a family life.
 I started as a business analyst and struggled to make meaningful stakeholder relationships. I a introverted, but I feel that I did not put much effort Into people skills. Because of that , I moved to data engineering. I am thinking of three options 
 1) move into data engineering platforms teams like Kafka, spark and become more technical. This role will have oncalls. 2) move into proper software engineering - more interesting but again oncall. 3) move into mobile engineering - lesser oncall load, but may get pigeonholed into iOS development. 4) move into data science - more interesting, but absolutely need top people skills, extroverted nature. But I like the role. No oncall. 5) move into data engineering management - no oncall, but again need people skills. If I am going to try this, would data science be rather better?
 Can I actually learn people skills and succeed in data science. I feel it best role in tech with no oncall. Can i succeed if it is not in my nature to get along with people easily? I can learn the tech part of data science, just worried about people skills. On the other hand I like engineering , but hate oncalls. 
 I am so confused. Please help me.

 By 2024, there will be around a dozen good A.I. labs not named OpenAI. Google itself has PaLM with RLHF, Chinchilla, Google Duplex, LaMDA and Sparrow (DeepMind). More foundational models will arrive as A.I. labs make their models public.

Digging through some of the code, I see a lot of os.system calls which conditionally execute other stand alone python scripts. This doesn't seem like the "right way" to do this, but I can kinda see why someone would do it this way: the alternative is creating a single callable function within these called scripts. I'm not an expert dev by any means, so I'm looking to hear what people think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey y’all, I discovered this great community recently and was inspired by the high quality responses so thank you to all the contributors!
 I have 7 yrs of work experience in the insurance industry, first 5 yrs as a claims / actuarial analyst at a major insurer and last 2 yrs as a ds at an early-stage insurtech startup.
 I’m finishing up my masters in ds and would like to consider opportunities outside insurance.
 I have strong programming skill as a ds (helped built internal Python-based ds infrastructure) and I’m familiar with most popular tech stacks such as Airflow, AWS, docker, etc. I’m also familiar with building and using procedures like back testing, automation, and unit tests. However, my current role uses time-series and probabilistic programming techniques so my ML skills (NLP, computer vision, classification, etc) are limited to my masters coursework. I’m also more of a user and maintainer of the models at work rather than someone who builds them. I enjoy both the ‘building’ and ‘analyzing’ part of my job.
 The dilemma I’m finding is that I don’t seem to have the domain knowledge and real-world ML experience to jump into a different domain. For example, many of these role would say ‘previous fraud detection (plug in anything here) experience required’. I just turned 30 and live in one of the highest COL regions. I’m targeting senior ds roles with a base pay of $175k and up. Anything less than that isn’t worth it for me financially.
 I prefer the tech industry but am really open to anything. Am I realistic in my expectations and how should I approach this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When thinking about the possibilities of artificial intelligence, I couldn't stop thinking about some sort of interactive Wikipedia, imagine all the objective knowledge of the universe compiled into a firmware pre-installed app just like the 'Calculator'. Another type of device that could become an incredible tool for solving problems, might even be useful for business or professionals. We could name it the 'Communicator', just like a calculator you enter endless math problems, with the communicator you could enter endless word problems. I think we could grab much more productivity out of this technology than just asking philosophical questions to Chat GPT.

 but in the future I am considering going to the US because there are more jobs I am interested in (social media and music companies). I guess it would be a better idea to work somewhere you actually care about the industry. 
 for now, I was placed in the talent pool in Amazon (passed the final interview successfully but they don’t have a job for me now) and waiting responses from other companies. 
 I feel a bit lost so any advice would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I have been creating my on projects for a while. Most of them are in GitHub however I feel is hard to show your projects in GitHub and more to people who is not IT including some recruiters.
 I always thought the best option is a personal webpage, but it takes much more time than social media and is not free. 
 As a conclusion I think instagram is a good/ easy option to show all the projects. But I guess is not the most professional.
 What do you guys think? And what do you use to show your projects to your colleagues or recruiters.

 Something that made me hope that more people might try out being creative and expressing themselves.
 Instead not only do you have some influencer literally repeating (and monetizing) the prompts you find here in this sub but I now stumbled over an ad account that brags how it usesChatGPT+midjourney to create ads for their dropshipping business (wow /s).
 Imagine you can create any story you want, any story you can ever tell to mankind, filled with nothing but your soul, your experience, your very self - and instead you spent your time filling the world with more of the shit people literally install adblockers to avoid.
 I know that people need to eat, pay rent and care for their families but I'd hoped they use AI as opportunity to do "more" and not push out the same shit content just faster.
 Not even utilizing this technology to make it better, or more creative or whatever different. They just do the same stuff, filling the world with more of the same uselessness than before.
 It's sounds arrogant and cheesy but I just hoped that because so many cool things are now doable for a lot more people that a lot more people would do cool things.
 Instead we get just the same stuff but more of it.

 I am a pretty accomplished data scientist. I have a very successful career so far and have been the lead for a startup bringing it from being bootstrapped up to a series B (so far). We are going to get bought out soon, and I'm looking for my next steps. 
 I have very much enjoyed the startup hustle, where I do everything from software engineering, ops, writing sales materials, being in pitch meetings ect. I want this freedom again, but am a little burned out after startup life. 
 Can anyone talk to me about transitioning to being a private contractor? I want to use your experience as a jumping off point as I dig further.

 I’ve considered trying out a free coding boot camp to get my foot in the door before my python and data structures classes, as well as scouted out areas for internships.
