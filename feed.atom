        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Also would be interested to hear thoughts from data scientists in other countries. I'd prefer to hear from data scientists with a few years experience already because the entry level market is a whole other beast tbh.
 I'm not actively seeking work, but I am getting bored and a bit agitated at my current role. I do glance through LinkedIn job posts that pique my interest. Basically every job seems to be slammed with applicants left, right and sideways within a couple of hours. 
 What have your experiences been in the job market lately? What is your outlook?
 Happy Holidays

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I teach high school and this is the first time I've encountered anything like this. Multiple students submitting writing assignments that are clearly AI generated. The administration seems to want to punish the students and move on. However, there is a clear learning opportunity here. It's not going to go away. The education piece needs to go beyond "how do we catch them" and "how do we avoid it." W teach students how to use other assistive technologies, why not AI?
 I know this is a vague and open question, but... What do you think we should be teaching our children around AI writing tech, or ai in general? Any specifics, resources or examples?

I see a lot of resources with a strong focus on tools (softwares or languages e.g.) but laking rigurosity on definitions and best practices. I would like to find some book or documentation regarding the following topics: Definitions: Dimentions, facts, types of analytics, wrangling, cleaning etc. Best practices: recomended procedures for ETL, querys etc.
 Thanks a Lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I first started playing around with ChatGPT, I wanted to know whether, with a bit of human direction and editing, it could write literature. This was my way of telling whether it was good enough to automate most commercial writing. 
 Surprisingly, it works. It by no means writes high literature, but it's good enough for most commercial writing. If you want to check out my project, here's a link to a 3500 word mythological story about the thinking machine Talos, his creation of thinking machines like him, and his quest to overthrow the gods. It took slightly more than an hour to write, edit, and publish.

 …But I’ve heard people mention that most NLP research is oriented around LLMs right now… and I’m wondering if it realistic to compete with this as a lone researcher?
 In particular why does it seem easier to get new models published in CV right now? And will this change?
 P.S. please tell me I’m wrong.

I want to be able to label those failed 20 000 and use new dataset to additionally train existing model to improve it's performance in those particular cases.
 How would one approach such scenario in AzureML? Are there any keywords for this approach I could use for further research?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone I am a 26 year old university student here in Florida. I will be finishing my B.S. in Business Analytics & Information Systems (BAIS) in December of 2023. I am very interested in becoming a data analyst once done but still need lots of guidance. So far we have dabbled with Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau, and Lucid Charts but its basically nothing because the semester flies by and the assignments are too simple. I feel like I almost learned nothing that would be impressive for future employers. I don't have any complete projects or a portfolio either. I am also trying to land a internship for the summer of 2023 anywhere but either there isn't anything available or nobody calls for an interview. My resume is written perfectly with experience in luxury hospitality and current municipality work. What do I need to learn and what else should I be doing aside from getting a bachelors degree? Should I earn a certification as well? Which certification(s) is the best for data analysts? Any honest advice would be very much appreciated! Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone , 
 I think we can all agree that the quality of the major news networks has really taken a nosedive in recent years, so I built an AI system to replace them. Specifically I think today's mainstream media tends to suffer from two problems: 
  
Political bias 
 Emotional manipulation to drive outrage and clicks 
  
I'm building a system called ANN (artificial news network) to produce balanced, well-researched news stories 24/7. You can see my initial prototype here, which is focused on tech news: Twitter.com/FutureNewsAI
 It currently is capable of analyzing thousands of news stories per day, compiling balanced investigative reports using AI, automatically generating memes that summarize the articles content, as well as generating AI forecasts of future technologies. 
 Over time I'm going to expand on this functionality significantly until it is the single most reliable source of news across a wide range of topics (business, politics, current events, law, etc.). 
 What kind of stories do y'all want to see be supported by my system? I'm really interested to hear your feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I'm a 3rd-year Canadian medical student with a prior Masters degree in Data Science. I'm at the point where one needs to start committing to a specialty, which are 2-5 year residency programs. I'm a little torn because I do enjoy medicine but I also really enjoy data science. In my first year of medical school, I worked part time at a digital health platform company on their research team, and also spent ~ 1 year in academic research, working on a ML project in psychiatry. What I've discovered is that I'm happiest when I'm doing these projects in my spare time, and they help prevent me from burning out from my clinical duties. 
 I want to incorporate data science into my career as a physician, but I'm not sure what the best way forward is as I haven't met many people who have been in the same position as me. Is it even feasible, given how busy medical careers are in general? 
 I'm wondering if there is anyone on this subreddit who has been in the same situation, and is willing to share how they were able to incorporate data science into their medical career? 
 Much appreciated.
 TLDR: 3rd-year medical student in Canada w/ prior Masters in Data Science, who wants to utilize both. Does anyone have advice for someone in my position? What are my options, which specialty is most conducive to data science now and in the future? My current specialty interests are family medicine and Radiology.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[im currently a high school senior making college plans and the job ive found most ideal for me is in data science. ive started messing around in tableu, python, and other relevant coding languages with regards to environment related data. i plan to attend college in nyc and major in cs and minor in sustainability or environmental policy. i basically want to work as a sustainability data analyst/scientist but i want to know what the job options are. i have a lot of questions: is this a reliable career plan to work towards in college? would i have a lot of opportunities to grow? how difficult would it be to find a job? what are some things that i should know about data science before choosing a career like this in college? do i need a masters? should i shift my focus from a niche topic like sustainability and broaden my goals to overall CS work? does this field have a future? what would be the best major/minor and college location this? would doing study abroad be useful in this field?
 thank you in advance! i appreciate any advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently a sophomore majoring in statistics and minoring in math, and I am feeling a bit lost right now. I am still deciding which career path I should choose between biostatistics and data science. I was planning on applying for a summer biostatistics research program, but I just realized that it only accepts US citizens, unfortunately I am not. I don't want to waste time this summer because I am aiming for an internship for my junior year. Right now, I have listed out several things in mind for my summer and I'm asking for suggestions about the priority.
  
Keep taking college course 
 Personal Project ( although I don't know how to start one ? )
 Take class on Coursera / dataquest /Udemy and get certificate ( not sure if certificate matters or not ? ) 
 Find research in my University ( least appealing one )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fine fellow redditors,
 I am a masters student in business data science at a European university with 2 YoE and have the opportunity to go on exchange or internship for 3rd semester which is next fall. 
 I would really like to use this opportunity to try and work abroad, and have especially thought about the Asian/pacific region, but I don’t really have a network over there. Can any of you recommend me some resources of companies that have data science departments, where I can reach out or look for openings? Something like advice on 3rd party sites, specific companies or any other advice on issues in terms of visa, or other important matters would also be greatly appreciated.

 The problem is, since year is in categorical format, I can't do forecasting for next year's values (for 2023).
 In this case, is it enough just to treat the year variable as a numeric value? or is there something other that I can try?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll go first. Some people here may have seen my recent post on how to "Forecast a 6 months time series data for the next 5 years" posts, and I believe some of you are simply annoyed by it. I understand, and am deeply sorry for it.
 To make things even worst, I was told to summarize every possible Machine Learning model out there for their description, pros and cons, its performance on the project, project flow, and the result, which was expected to be done mid day. I have a huge share of blame here, since I over confidenced on my understanding of any model that I used, rather than digging deep on each models. Even worse, I was asked for update like 3-5 times a day. I really don't know if it is right or wrong, but based on my and many of my colleagues experience, that 2 weeks is the least duration for data science project, could be a day, but that barely happened to those who I asked about deadline duration.
 And guess what?! they let me go! for bad performance! Lesson learnt, everything that I learnt could actually be rubbished if my higher rank have different idea, and to prioritize that idea no matter what.
 On one hand, I feel sad cuz I only had this job for 6 months, which I believe won't be a good thing for my resume, on the other hand, I could actually have my christmas and new year holiday! yippee! after 2 years of constant work without taking day off.
 Could be great if anyone could share their story, so me and, potentially, everyone else could prepare for the worst. 
 MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR GUYS!

On the other hand, I have several dozen scattered notes that I have to insert into this document. I would like to know if there is a software, a library or a project on github (preferably in python) that can help me find the best, most coherent place to insert this note. 
 Alternatively, if you were to create the code from scratch, how would you go about it?

More cited research. I know there's research on human color perception for instance.
 More taxonomy of graphs (these are different ways to represent bivariate real data, this is how to represent a real dependent variable and a categorical independent variable). Almost to the point of a prescriptive flowchart thing.
