 He almost never shows up on time for our virtual code sessions. Of the nine times that we’re supposed to meet he’s showing up three on time and ready to go. Otherwise he’s anywhere from a half hour to an hour and a half late.
  
Our project lead assigned him to me because I was much more advanced and agreed to coach and mentor him but it’s like he thinks I’m going to telepathically teach him everything it’s like he doesn’t have the concept of how to study. Consequently he is completely lost in debugging and has just no idea even how to debug a basic python, import, syntax or any errors.

These models are making the company 100-200k a day; however, I can't physically keep up this pace. I've been working every waking hour of the day and last weekend I got fed up with it and I actually took my weekend off. Of course, there were request coming in throughout the weekend and I simply didn't respond. I got a message from a stakeholder telling me that they were disappointed that I didn't answer messages over the weekend. 
 I've told my manager I can't keep up this pace but I haven't received any protection. What should I do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm a uni student, I'm taking a course on robotics, a rough idea of the final project is to have multiple robots walking on their own, learning from the environment and sharing knowledge with each other (not necessarily building the robots, most probably we will just do a simulation, so computationally expensive solutions are also acceptable).
 The problem is i have never done anything related to AI nor taken any courses on the subject, and the prof expects us to pick it up on our own.
 I'm quiet good at programming(Python, C, Java), and i do know a bit of probability/statistics
 Could you please suggest some courses that would help me with this.
 PS: I did read the wiki, but feared that the courses suggested there are not necessarily the best in my context.
 PS 2:Sorry if this isn't the most appropriate sub, should i post this on /r/ML too?
 Thank you very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi everyone,
 good day! I am a newbie data analyst in a startup and have been given the responsibility to train the interns in python coding.
 However, my seniors didn't want me to teach them in Jupyter notebooks.
 (Reason they gave - "Teaches bad coding")
 Sure, the basics I can teach them via Pycharm etc. But now I am currently at a loss as to how else am I supposed to teach them the analytics part of Python (pandas, numpy etc).
 I googled "Cons of Jupyter notebooks" but most are about how notebooks shouldn't be used for deployment, which is kind of obvious to me. But I am not sure how to teach them in-depth analytics without Jupyter notebooks.
 Can you please advise on this??

Most awards are 25%-75% but there has been a few 100% awards. There is a separate one for Women and Tech and Veterans.
 All programs are online and with live instructors 100% of the time. 
 I am definitely biased because I work there, but, imho, it is a wonderful education at a bootcamp-style pace and gives you real world job skills that leads to employment.
 You can find all the details under Financial Aid on the website: https://digitalworkshopcenter.com/
 Hit me up with any questions too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a last year Data Science bachelor student in Europe on track to graduate by June 2023. I believe I have quite a strong profile for grad school applications and will be applying to some top grad schools in Europe/US for a masters in Data Science. I already put in all the effort of gathering letters of recommendation, writing SOPs, taking the GRE, etc... 
 For fun I applied to an Uber 6 month internship program and have now progressed to the final round. I will be left with a huge dilemma on what to do if I would actually get offered the role. So it's a full time 6 month internship starting in Jan which will cause me to delay my studies. This also means that my applications for my masters will have to be postponed for a full year and I (feel like I will) lose some of my momentum for my grad school applications as I don't think an Uber internship is really valuable for grad schools applications. Uber did tell me that they're looking to transfer me to a full-time employee after my bachelor's so I could work a bit for them and then go on to do my masters later. Although in the current market I don't know how good my chances for that happening would actually be. 
 The money from the internship would be quite a life changer for me but I would hate to see all my work for my grad school applications go to waste and perhaps not have as good chances next year. 
 Anyone here who would be able to give some perspective on this and perhaps some advice would be much appreciated!

 I already have clients via my relative area where I serve as their Customer Analytics consultant. What started as a side gig is gaining momentum, and I want to have an official channel to host my consultancy. I want to ask you all where's the best place to host the consultancy?
 Few details:
  
I live in the US
 I find my clients in-person and via referrals, and have a small business license (literally just a business name that I pay for every year)
 My clients usually need help in three areas: Analytics Implementation, Dashboard Setup, and Optimizing Campaigns.
  
While finding clients via referrals is great, I would like to establish a stronger online presence, and few friends told me to look into UpWork or Fiverr. But I want to ask if there are better avenues for finding clients online?

 Does any of you have experience with applying data science to business challenges in SaaS companies?
 ​
 For example:
  
Web analytics to optimize marketing spend
 Customer segmentation to personalize marketing activities
 Business dashboards to optimize strategies
 Churn analytics to minimize customer churn.

 I'm curious about your experiences.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What I mean is, requests that in general tableau is not built for or doesn’t have a functionality for. There are plenty of workarounds on the internet, but sometimes those “workarounds” added together make the back end of tableau super messy and super hard to modify/ debug in the future. At my current company, the previous guy basically did what he was asked for, but it takes me weeks just to edit one little thing and I hate it with a passion. When I joined the company, I told them it was my goal to clean it all up and leave it better for me, my coworkers and any future employee to work with. My boss recently asked for another of those requests but I told him I’d rather present it differently than what he is asking for because of those issues. I will always give him the data he needs, but I can’t always present it the way he wants because it makes things “unclean” on the backend. I worked as a software engineer and I’ve always strived for “clean code”, which is the approach I’m trying to use here. I haven’t heard back from him but wondering if other people have dealt with this and how you handled it?

For me, it was Stanford's EE261 course that made Fourier Transform click for me. Here is the link: https://see.stanford.edu/course/ee261
Similarly for deep learning it was fast.ai courses.

 Just want people's opinions on forecasting with minimal Data. I have 11 months of sales data and want to forecast the next month. The data has certain peaks during promotional days in certain months but the promotion days are not going to be in every year. 
 Also it is difficult to determine any seasonality or trend with just few months data. 
 What method of forecasting do you normally use with minim data? I heard that simpler methods are sometimes better in this case? 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'd like to introduce a semantic segmentation model called RTFormer, which is accepted by NeurIPS 2022. 
 Hope this be some help to you.
 RTFormer is an efficient dual-resolution transformer for real-time semantic segmenation, which achieves better trade-off between performance and efficiency than CNN-based models.
 To achieve high inference efficiency on GPU-like devices, RTFormer leverages GPU-Friendly Attention with linear complexity and discards the multi-head mechanism. Besides, cross-resolution attention is more efficient to gather global context information for high-resolution branch by spreading the high level knowledge learned from low-resolution branch.
 Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RTFormer, it achieves state-of-the-art on Cityscapes, CamVid and COCOStuff, and shows promising results on ADE20K.
 Official code is available at: https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg/tree/develop/configs/rtformer

 What are the new challenges for managers in the face of AI?
 According to an interesting article from the scientific journal Management & Datascience, AI could have an impact on managers' project management.
 Indeed, this is what Cecile Dejoux, decryptor and lecturer on managerial and HR transformations, describes in her article "How artificial intelligence attacks the manager?" in particular by the difference between Humans and AI.

Because the learner is trained to respond to “yes” and “no” type questions without explaining how the answer was obtained. An explanation of how an answer was achieved is critical in many applications for assuring confidence and openness. Explainable AI refers to strategies and procedures in the use of artificial intelligence technology (AI) that allow human specialists to understand the solution’s findings. This article will focus on explaining the machine learner using OmniXAI. Following are the topics to be covered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From my reading, the supply chain industry has a lot of fully integrated supply chain management solutions. These solution typically have some modules related to data science out of the box. Take for example Kinaxis, which has its Planning.AI within its ecosystem. Others like Blue Yonder, SAP and O9 also feature some readily built-in data science solutions to tackle supply chain problems. 
 Sure other industries also have their own popular proprietary solutions bought from the market.
 However, for supply chain specifically, I kinda have the impression that the usage of open source solutions like R/Python/Julia is lesser known. Python has PuLP, R has ROI package and Julia has JuliaOpt. But choosing which one over the other is not always clear. You have more resources online debating the merits of R vs Python, say for deep learning with concrete examples of how they are being used in the industry. 
 I just joined the supply chain industry and there is a lot of focus on getting certified on these paid solutions (Kinaxis, Blue Yonder, O9, etc). While the opportunity to learn the proprietary systems is great, I hope to ensure my previously acquired skills in R/Python remain relevant in this industry. For example, previously I used R forecast package to perform demand forecasting. This was because the client was mainly using Excel tool and the SAP system has very basic forecasting feature. 
 But now it seems that this proprietary systems are gettibg more sophisticated with the supply chain offering that you can run some level of AI within their integrated systems.
 So how is R/Python being used alongside the proprietary solution in the supply chain industry?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have to create a roadmap for my department. My boss wants me to create a 5 year roadmap.
 In my first year, i mainly dealt with descriptive analytics (dashboarding, visualizing, sql queries, some statistics). In terms of tools, I am well equipped for my work (PowerBI, PowerApps, Databricks, Git, ...)
 How could I set up a roadmap so that progress can be seen? I'm familiar with the principles of ML, so something like that would also be possible and I'm completely free.
 So I collected the first low hanging fruits. My work is appreciated. How to proceed? What are the options?
 More direction predictive/forecasting? Data governance? (more employees is not an option)

I get sick the Monday of, and if I call in sick, sure I don't work Monday, but the deadline remains the same. I basically just work the Monday into the following days. Does anyone feel the same?
 The project type work is so different than shift type work where the latter means if you take a sick day, your responsibilities are really removed from your workload.
 The only thing I can think of is, if a DS has a sick day, the workplace should automatically postpone the deadline by 1 day to give DS a real day to rest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming to the end of new college graduate hiring season and there has been an odd trend with candidates coming from these newer programs. I am not sure these programs are really preparing their students for success in the field. I had an interview with a data analytics major and they did not have to take any statistics classes and they are in their senior year. Likewise, they just had one machine learning course but did not have to take any programming classes. So, they might get through an HR interview with some surface level knowledge but once they get to the technical interviews, they flounder. 
 Are others involved in interviewing seeing this? I am starting to get bad vibes when I see these majors come up for interviews, especially if they list that they are in a business school (With some offer data science majors which seems like a weird fit).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I applied for a senior DS role, talked with the technical recruiter, and then spent the weekend on the take home project provided by the company. 
 The next week I met with the Director and he said he passed me through 2 rounds and that this discussion is the final step. He asked a few questions but had seemingly already made up his mind to offer me the job after the take home project (which he did at the end of the call).
 I have not met the remainder of the team, so I have some anxieties about accepting because it all happened so fast. Would you ask to meet a few other team members before accepting?
 Thanks!
