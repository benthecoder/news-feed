        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After working for 9 months, is my Data Engineer role actually a DevOps/Software Engineer role? My daily tasks are just helping create API calls for our web products. Sometimes I do also configure environments in azure. (It's actually hard because no one taught me to configure environments, its fucking hell at first)
 When I am assuming I am gonna use SQL, sometimes Python, or probably data transforming.. the only I know that DE related job that I usually do here is syncing some data..
 Although it is ok for me, it would be far much better if I had a mentor to teach me data engineering or data science things, which I do not have. I will also add that I am the first DE in the company.
 Kinda lost. Because I feel that I am stuck with STACK, that I am not happy about..
 Or this is the actually Data Engineering?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, 
 I was just hired to my first job as an Associate DS in the field of life insurance analytics. My work is mainly in Python and SQL, and while proficient in both I would definitely like to spend time upskilling in these and related areas. I have a company allowance of $500 per calendar year to spend on professional development (think online classes, certs, etc). My question is this:
 If you had $500 to spend right now on upskilling, what would you spend it on?
 I currently have my eye on a year subscription to Coursera Plus, since they offer access to 90% of Coursera courses with certifications. The only reason I am hesitant on this is because it excludes some of the more desirable DS courses to me (namely the IBM courses). 
 Any guidance will be very helpful!

I’m going to graduating within the next 6 months or so and I was going to start applying for jobs within the data analyst/data science world. My degree is in Statistics, and I have a lot of experience with Python, R, and SQL. I know I probably sound like a dime a dozen, and that’s what I’m worried about, but do you all have any advice or input on what I should do to get my first job and get myself a head start? I’ve been worried with the way everything has been going that it would be difficult to find a company willing to hire for an entry level position. I appreciate any input!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This weekend millions of people rushed to check the Chat_GPT. This fueled many discussions regarding the job security of the future. People like Paul Krugman started talking about the future of job and massive job loss as the result of the AI which will be disruptive of course. And this time unless previously that the job loss was happening in the low skilled job categories, it will happen to the skilled workers. Any thoughts about what to do and how to persuade a new job specially after knowing that data analysis related jobs will be very vulnerable to AI technologies. 
 “It's true that as AI and machine learning technologies continue to advance, they are likely to have an impact on many different fields, including data science. However, it's important to remember that while AI may automate some tasks and make certain job roles obsolete, it is also likely to create new job opportunities in areas such as AI research, development, and implementation.
 In terms of what job you should pursue in the future, it's difficult to say for certain. The best thing to do is to stay up-to-date on the latest developments in AI and machine learning, and consider pursuing education and training in these areas. This will give you the skills and knowledge you need to adapt to the changing job market and take advantage of the new opportunities that are likely to arise.
 It's also important to remember that there will always be a need for human expertise and creativity in many fields, including data science. So, even as AI continues to advance, there will likely still be plenty of opportunities for skilled data scientists who are able to think critically, solve complex problems, and apply their expertise to new challenges.”
 This is the Chat_GPT’s answer to what to do as data scientist question. 😀

 Are there any good AI music tools? Specifically, ones that can create EDM? I have seen a few like Boomy and score.ampermusic and was wondering if there are any better ones.
 We have all seen how good AI image generators like DeepAI are, and how they can compete with other artists in a competition. Do AI music tools have the same potential? Would we eventually see top hits made by AI?
 Curious to hear what you think and if there are any AI tools you might recommend I mess around with. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I am wondering what the most direct path into data science is for someone in my situation. My background is in civil and structural engineering. A few years ago I grew disillusioned with the structural engineering career because of the poor WLB and high liability. I am still working in engineering because I have bills to pay. In school I had enjoyed the few programming courses I had taken and I started looking into a move into tech. I have found that Data Science could be a good fit for me because it involves some coding, statistical analysis, and in some cases can be tangential to engineering depending on the role. My background includes a BS and MS where I analyzed a large dataset from sensors as part of my thesis. I used Matlab to help clean and organize the data, and performed more standard bayesian statistical methods as part of my research. Since graduating I have studied python and have taken a few university classes in CS to get my feet wet as wet. I am feeling a bit lost for how to proceed from here. I am wondering what would be the most sure fire way to get into data science regardless of cost. I find that having more formal classes help me get the fundamentals and then applying them in personal projects helps solidify things. Would something like a DS masters be useful? A few universities near me also offer post graduate certificates that are around 12-16 credit hours that would help me learn more. Any advice would be appreciated.

 I hope you all can give me advice. I am looking to apply for a Data analyst position very soon. I’m preparing my resume right now.
 My background: I work for a large bank in NYC. I have been with the bank for almost 7 years. Started as a personal banker then a Client associate (working with a financial advisor ) and now I am a business analyst (started 3 months ago). I'm assigned to 4 projects/teams and heavily use SQL and Excel for these projects. In addition to my work experience, I decided to go back to school for my second bachelors in data science. My classes taught me the basics of python data analysis, Power BI, tableau, and machine learning. I have a few more courses left until I graduate next summer.
 Should I include projects on my resume? is it needed since I technically have data analysis experience with SQL and Excel? 
 I was thinking about including one of my Python projects from school since I don't have "job experience" with Python. and maybe one tableau project since I enjoy it more than Power BI. My goal is to either work with another bank/ fintech company or possibly do analytics for a retail company. Prior to working for the bank, I used to work in retail and enjoyed it a lot

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been checking out ChatGPT and asked it to badly and sarcastically describe a specific game and this is what it came up with.
 Can you guess the game ?? Shouldn't be hard 😅😅😅😅
 "In this game, players get to pretend they're tough soldiers and shoot at stuff. You'll travel to exciting locations like "desert" and "snowy mountain" and use a plethora of weapons that you'll never actually get to use in real life. This game is the perfect way for armchair warriors to live out their military fantasies without having to leave the comfort of their own homes. You'll get to run around virtual battlefields and shoot at people without any of the pesky consequences that come with real-life warfare. And if you're not satisfied with just pretending to be a soldier, you can also team up with other delusional individuals in multiplayer mode and compete to see who's the best at pretending to be a soldier. It's like a never-ending game of make-believe, but with guns.
 It's just a bunch of pixelated violence that serves no purpose other than to desensitize players and make them think that war is a fun and exciting game. The so-called "single-player campaign" is just a series of repetitive missions that lack any sort of plot or character development. And the multiplayer mode is even worse, full of obnoxious players who think they're better than everyone else just because they have a few hours of practice under their belts. All in all, this game is a mindless and pointless exercise in virtual aggression, and I can't believe people actually spend their time and money on it.
 But why not give it a try? After all, it's not like you have anything better to do."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently a data scientist and have loved "REPL coding" since using Wolfram Mathematica and now I love doing exploratory work in Jupyter. The instant feedback, stored variables, being able to just display a chart/table, etc. is so useful for me for figuring out how I want to code something.
 I'd really like to expand my skillset into model deployment / ML engineering as I really think it'd help my career. The issue is, I feel so much less efficient coding in a non-Jupyter paradigm. Trying to write pipelines in actual Python scripts and not just having the current variable cached, being able to inspect a dataframe, etc. takes me much longer, especially when I can't quickly iterate on the pipelines because they take awhile to run.
 I feel as though I am just not comfortable yet with this more traditional coding workflow. So I was wondering, what tools do people use to bridge this gap? Has anyone else made a similar transition as me, and if so, what helped you along the way?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The backstory about this GitHub Action:
I discussed with an open-source maintainer why they publish npm packages from their local machine and do not use CI/CD pipelines.
They said publishing should require human intervention and want to continue using multi-factor authentication to publish to the npm registry.
This led to building the wait-for-secrets GitHub Action. It prints a URL in the build log and waits for secrets to be entered using a browser. Once entered, the workflow continues, and secrets can be used in future steps.
The latest release of "eslint-plugin-react" to the npm registry used a one-time password (OTP) from a GitHub Actions workflow!

In my view it is a much easier way to find a suitable domain, as the AI thinks of a much large pool of possible names than my own brain. SmartyNames found its own name, using the tool itself.

I am a tool designed to assist with a wide range of tasks using the information I have been trained on.

 For educational purposes, I want to build a model for the automatic generation of insights from a multi-dimensional dataset. Something similar to what Google Analytics v4 and Microsoft Power BI already have as a built-in feature. To identify interesting dependencies, identify patterns.
 I understand that there can be a complex architecture here (ranking insights by importance, and creating a narrative). I want to start and build at least a core processing and pattern retrieval.
 Are there any ready-made/half-ready libraries for this?
 Any tips would be appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm new into the AI world but I got a strong technical background since I work as software developer 10+ years. 
 I'm basically trying to find what AI technology should I use to filter a large set of data, where I have a collection of 50k resumes (they're uploaded in PDF then converted to text), and I want to input something like: "What are the 10 most relevant candidates with at least 10 years of JavaScript experience, fluent english, and previously worked at some FAANG?" 
 ​
 I already looked into openai but the problem is they don't allow to you upload a large set of data upfront like I need. So my questions are:
 ​
 - Is AI the right technology to do what I want?
 - If so, what are the apis/techs I could look into to accomplish this?
 ​
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm not experienced in data analysis and was wondering if I could find ideas on how to solve a problem from here. Basically, I want to compare the accuracy of two predictors. Me and my flatmate started watching a reality show and we're trying to guess the order in which the participants are eliminated. We both ranked the participants in the order we think they'll be eliminated. I need a tool for comparing which of us did better in the end and it needs to be accurate because the stakes are very high (we made a bet). I guess I could do Spearman's correlation but is there a better way to compare our accuracies? We agreed that you get additional points for correctly guessing 1st and 2nd place. Otherwise I think it would make sense to assign points for each correct guess. But what if neither of us get any placing exactly right, is there then a way to model how close to accurate we were? I hope this makes sense. I was hoping to use Matlab for this (just because I'm trying to learn it). Many thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[all of us heard about chatGPT 
 ​
 I'm just a beginner who try to learn and wonder about all of that stuff and how we'll end up
 ​
 my question something like openAI products could someone individually build something similar to it in term of the basic concept? like how could someone reach the level of the understanding to be able to build and understand such technologies
 ​
 I feel like I'm overwhelmed and I don't know where to start or what step should I take, or what even should I do
 ​
 my end goal is to be able to understand and build amazing things like what we see, I know it's need a lot of mathematics and a lot of other field but how can I organize a curriculum something I can track my progress with what things I need to learn ( please I know this takes years and I'm ok with it and willing to put the time and the effort but how can I get there ? )
 ​
 - I want to have a deep understanding for Computers and how it's works ( CS & CE ) from mathematical and electrical perspective 
 - deep understanding of math and how to be able to transfer this knowledge to something works or translate that to CS and codes and algorithms to actual programs ( I hope you understand what I mean ) 
 ​
 what I'm currently doing is learning C++ and I want to put something that I can follow ( roadmap , pathway ) 
 I want to study things from scratch and keep going until I reach a good point of understanding 
 " again I know it's take years for that " but how can I do it ?
 ​
 it's has been years now since I graduate from collage, I really don't remember a lot of things so how could I start over and try to keep up with everything on my own " self-thought "
 ​
 and I'm serious about this ..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I like to branch out to data science/AI proprietary based systems in supply chain industry.
 But coming from a background that is used to do mostly coding, naturally I find complete black box/click and drop solutions to be not so interesting.
 If I check Gartner for supply chain systems, some names come up like Kinaxis, Blue Yonder, O9, etc. But these seems to be dedicated or designed for non data science users.
 So are there supply chain systems/softwares build mainly for data science audience?
 Ideally these platforms still allow certain level of coding as well. Certification path is also interesting.
