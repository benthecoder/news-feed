 I'm a recent grad, May of 2021 with a B.A in Data Science & Statistics (it's an applied math degree). Although I'm a new grad, I'm fortunate to have 1.5 years of professional experience as a data analyst, spanning one internship and two contract roles. However, I am trying to get my foot in the door as a Data Scientist, and am currently participating in an Applied Data Science Program in lieu of a master's (I have my own philosophy of getting a master's degree AKA its too much money and I'd rather use all available resources at my disposal first)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently a senior, graduating this spring with a BS in Psychology and Criminology Minor. I want a career that has something to do with forensic/criminal psychology, but can’t narrow it down to a specific occupation. I don’t particularly want to get a doctorate, but I know I need further education to do something I’m remotely interested in. I’m from Illinois and if I continue school I want something affordable and close to home. I’ve recently been looking at being a Crime Analyst/Intelligence Analyst, but my only problem is I discovered this too late and I rarely have data analysis experience (besides the introductory data science class I’m taking this semester). I don’t even know where to start with grad school. Is it possible to apply for grad school for masters in data analysis/science without experience? Should I get certified as a data analyst through an online program instead? I don’t know this is a very unorganized post, but my mind is all over the place about this and I don’t know how to begin narrowing down my options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently came upon a news article on YouTube and there other sketchy websites about a classmate of mine who was in a serious car crash, but these were obviously not written by a human. I don’t want to post it here for her privacy but her name is spelled differently multiple times, there are incorrect details, and other giveaways that shows it was written by a robot. The weirdest detail was that she died, which wasn’t true. But how are there photos of her and other things like that ?? Super weird anyways is this AI and how does this happen?

 Example: Users on iOS -> Guest payment -> One product only -> fast shipment are down -10% YxY (4 dimensions out of 17)
 There are endless amount of possibilities and concats that I could do so I was wondering if there was an "algorithm" or python script / library that I can feed those 17 different dimensions and it would tell me the possible combination that performance worse?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: struggling to make an anthro shark using AI, and am seeking advice on how to get the result I want, or at least a legible result where you can tell that it is even a humanoid shark
 So, I am trying to create an illustration for a shark race in my brain universe (basically a universe I’ve been building canon for in head since I was twelve) and as I cannot draw well, for the rest of the races I have been able to create illustrations using AI generators like DALL E 2, wonder, starryai, and nightcafe, and this has occasionally been a challenge I usually am able to just put “anthropomorphic ____ wearing a jacket” and it gives me an illustration of an anthropomorphic race, however this hasn’t been working with the shark race, I have been trying everything from adding essays of keywords to grabbing starting images from artists and trying to get the AI to build off of that, and it just keeps looking messy, wrong, or comes out looking like an actual shark instead of a humanoid shark. “Well why not just use art you find other people have made if you aren’t going to profit off of this?” I hear you asking, and to that I say I need something unique to me in there in order for it to feel like mine, even if I’m just asking an AI to branch of and start with someone else’s picture, the end product still feels like mine. Anyways explanation out of the way, for the life of me I can’t figure out how to do it the way I want it, so my last resort is in turning here, does anyone else use AI to make anthropomorphic characters? And if so, what AI do you use? What keywords do you use? And please, do you have any tips to help me get the result I want i feel Ive tried everything haha

 I’ve made a post on a subreddit about my project (https://rawquery.com) and someone there suggested that I should crosspost it here because you would be able to give valuable feedback on it. So here I’m am!
 I’ve tried to crosspost but it’s a video and this community doesn’t support that. You can see the same video on the website, tho.
 Basically I’m using AI to let people interact with their data using natural language instead of having to write SQL by themselves.
 Since interacting with data is something that you probably do all the time, I would really appreciate your perspective and feedback.
 It’s paid, but if you want to check it out I can invite you for free, just let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the process of trying to land my first industry job after completing my PhD in Aerospace Engineering. Not related to DS yes but have had exposure to applied ML in research, good stats knowledge, know all the standard libraries, SQL etc. No AWS yet but I'm learning how to use it.
 I keep having the same problem over and over - I get a decent amount of interviews, but they invariably say something along the lines of "we really like you, but you have no experience so no thanks.". This even happened for a startup that was 80% made of aerospace PhD grads from my lab, which was both hilarious and incredibly disheartening.
 Any seniors/hiring managers in here have any advice for someone on my position? I am applying to internship/grad positions, junior and a few mid level positions there the JD says they will even consider grads.

 It seems to me like a simple description of an account would be sufficient for such a system to do the whole work automatically. 
 Do You think it is possible, or maybe it does already exist?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm thinking that maybe GitHub is not the best option for the long term. I just uploaded a 60MB JSON Lines file, and I got the large-file warning. 
 Kaggle might be good, but they're no longer supporting organizations, just individual accounts. And I'd like to publish datasets under my startup company's name.
 Is there anything else out there? I'm thinking I might need to build something myself: a simple front-end backed by S3 or IPFS.
 Or ... I'm thinking, maybe I will stay with Git and either GitHub and GitLab: but I'll figure out ways to divide up the data into smaller files. E.g., the 60MB dataset is all 800 chapters of the Oregon Revised Statutes. That could be 800 separate files. And maybe I'd store them in a shallow directory tree (by "Volume") so that there'd be < 100 files per sub-directory. By keeping these in Git, I couild theoretically track changes to the laws over time.

Typical data will have around 25M nodes; as per current understanding the data will be similar to any social graph or supply chain management. In future we possibly want to try GNN based model. The deployment will be on-prem or bare metal. Neo4j is not an option due to cost implication. The free version of Tigergraph supports up to 50G - not sure if that is good enough for our data.

 Look loser, I’m glad you paid big money for some fancy degree in statistics or whatever, but while you were up in your Ivory tower learning useless skills like bootstrapping, I was here on the ground working with real data, solving real business cases and delivering value. 
 Python? Don’t make me laugh. Excel is all you need. Why spend time on “containerization” and “dependency management” when I can fire up my trusty old XP machine in order to convert Jan’s old workbook into xlsx? 
 Plotting? Built into Excel. Aggregation? Built into Excel. Transformer-based natural language embeddings? Not built into Excel, and thus not important. While you were religiously watching Coursera videos, I was learning from Steve Balmer’s every move. That man knew how to deliver business insight using actionable intelligence. 
 I’m all about the North Star metrics. I align with the business leaders. I distill all day.
 Dweebs on my team keep talking about “controlling for multiple hypotheses” and “effect sizes.” Is it an Excel function? No? Then forget it, we have real work to do here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all!
 I'm excited to release AutoPlot, a tool I built to tackle the question: what if you could do any data analysis by just speaking in natural language?
 No confusing scripts, Excel macros, or Matplotlib incantations.
 AutoPlot allows you to explore the limits of next generation human interfaces for visually understanding data.
 Here's how it works: I've provided a few datasets you can analyze out-of-the-box such as Wine, Hurricanes, and Titanic. Select one of the datasets to see a preview of its contents including its schema. When you are ready to do some visual analysis, simply provide a natural language description of what you want AutoPlot to do.
 I look forward to hearing your questions/feedback.
 Hope you find it fun!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm not a data scientist, I just want to ask for your help/advice, since I figured you guys might be good at solving this kind of problems.
 My goal is to write a program that can find associations between random words.
 Like if I give it a word "cat" and a word "dog", I want it to be able to return me the words like "fur", "tail", "pet", "mammal" - all the things these two words have in common.
 I want it to work even for words that don't have a lot in common, or find associations that aren't obvious. Actually, that would be the main purpose of this model.
 So if I give it two words like "baby" and "onion", I want it to output words like "crying" (since both babies and onions are associated with crying). Or "cake" and "cow" would both output "food".
 Do you think that's possible to do? How would you approach this?
