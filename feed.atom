        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34512145</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/ryukoposting/Signal-Android/tree/fork-5.53.8"/>
        <updated>2023-01-24T23:28:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Signal was a brilliant app. It can send messages with rich media, host group chats, and even do voice and video calls, all with the peace of mind that comes from a proper secure messaging app. The best part was that you could still send messages to people who don't use Signal. Signal was the messaging app everyone wants - all the benefits of iMessage, without being siloed in one particular ecosystem.
Sometime leading up to October of 2022, the folks at the Signal foundation lost the plot. Signal has since dropped support for SMS, and is inexplicably adding "stories" to their personal messaging app. I despise this.
Instead of just complaining about it, I decided to do something about it. Here is a link to a version of the Signal Android app that still supports SMS, and doesn't have stories. There also isn't a stupid, nagging banner telling you to update. Right now, it's just Signal 5.38 with a couple lines commented out, but I plan to integrate any upstream security/UX improvements in the near future. For now, you'll have to build/install it yourself, but I will eventually put an APK out there for people to download. Enjoy!

 Quick intro, 10 years business experience and 3 years basic data analytics (Excel & Tableau) - we're developing our data capabilities and I'm looking to learn SQL, predictive analytics/models, python and ML.
 Previously, I've always used free online learning to teach myself (Excel, Tableau, Html etc.) and never been in the position to ask for funded learning. I don't meet prerequisites for masters (stats degrees) and it feels too long of a process to do a bachelors... Boot camps have mixed reviews here. I don't want to miss the opportunity but feels like self teaching is often recommended! 
 What would you suggest is the best way to learn data science, if costs were covered? (UK Based)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two months ago, we left our jobs at AWS and Figma to continue building Infisical.
It is an open-source end-to-end encrypted tool that helps you manage developer secrets across your team, devices, and infrastructure.
During the previous Show HN, we got a lot of useful feedback which we’ve been iterating on A LOT!
In the past month, we’ve been pretty much working 24/7, and we added:
- Integrations for Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Actions, Render, and Fly.io
- Public API
- User activity logs
- Point-in-time recovery and secret versioning
- Custom environments
- Kubernetes operator (https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/platforms/kubernetes)
And made lots of other performance improvements both on the frontend and backend.
Our repo is published under the MIT license so any developer can use Infisical. The goal is to not charge individual developers. We make money by charging a license fee for some enterprise features as well as providing a hosted version and support.
In the coming weeks, we plan to add features like key rotation, alerts, and secret groups - as well as continue adding more integrations.
Give it a try (https://github.com/Infisical/infisical)! We’d love to hear what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I accepted an internship offer from Company A. Then I got an invitation for final round interview with a company I had a first-round interview with long back then, let say company B.
 Company A does not give many return offers while company B does. But I haven't prepared for interview in a while, so I think I might not do well for the interview with company B.
 If I do bad for the final round interview, will it leave a bad impression if I want to apply for full time later?
 Option 1: Should I still have interview with company B?
 Option 2: Should I let company B know that I accepted an offer and hope they will consider me for full time position later?
 I don't want to break trust. So I am more inclined to Option 2. But now given the massive layoffs, I am not sure what is the best practice to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a publicly traded retail company. Normally at the end of each quarter there are a few questions that require ad hoc reporting. Over the past year (as a senior data analyst) I developed and automated many reports to reduce the workload created by quarter ends. The only novel reporting required is what leadership develops as their story to the board. A few months ago I was promoted to a data science role. We’ve hired a junior analyst right out of college who’s green but is learning very quickly. Now, the head of my department (marketing) is attempting to implement a blackout period the week after each quarter ends, to keep us available for ad hoc data requests. I am pushing back, insisting that there are self service reporting tools and that with enough foresight reports could be built ahead of a possible vacation. I’ve come to a compromise of saying that both the analyst and I can’t both be off during that week but not sure if that’ll be accepted or not. So my question to you folks is, do you have blackout dates in your current or past roles and how would react with your job implementing blackout dates for you?
 Additional info: I have 2 kids in school and activities and book vacations with travel points most of the time so my dates usually are not that flexible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I’m a masters student studying data science. I’m currently on the hunt for a data science internship. I applied to an internship on Sunday, thinking it’d take weeks to hear from them, and this give me time to prepare for the technical interview. I’ve never done a technical interview before! Turns out they responded the next day and invited me to their technical interview. If you could design a 2 week crash course on interview-prep, what would you suggest I focus on?
 I am going into the interview with a mindset of practice- I know I won’t get the first one. But I’d like to prepare myself the best I can to get the most out of the experience. And hopefully learn from it and do better each time. 
 Thanks, friends!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the global AI market size expanding each year, it is expected to reach USD 641.30 billion by 2028.
 AI today is everywhere; while some businesses are using it, others are still assessing it.
 All too often, people get caught up in the hype and forget to ask themselves why they should be doing what they are doing.
 Here are some things you must keep in mind while looking into the AI world:
 The Reality of AI Hype
 The hype leads companies to get into the game with a false perception of what AI can help them achieve. Without a clear understanding of what technology can and can't accomplish today, there is a lot of risk in getting involved.
 Beyond the fog
 Overmarketing of an AI creates an image that it is the next big thing. Companies often engage with technology vendors based on marketing alone and forget to look closely at previous implementations and results of the same sort.
 Unclear Objectives
 Measuring outcomes from an AI implementation can be tricky as it involves building and training an AI model and experimenting with long-term trial-and-error before seeing results.
 High Expectations
 High expectations around what AI can do for you often lead to disappointment when business owners conveniently underestimate the challenges and misinterpret the reality of AI.
 Lack of Access to Talent
 There are opportunities galore, but not enough experts in the AI industry who can steer the ship and take AI projects to the finish line.
 Hiring for an AI team can mean huge investments, and working with a vendor needs a careful vetting process.
 And AI industry is moving too fast for people to catch a moment to realize the overhype or quality.
 Drop in your suggestions and comments in the section below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The future of AI is getting really interesting, particularly with language models and generative AI. But I think there is going to be a great deal of confusion in the near future about AI ethics with language models being "self aware" and having "feelings", particularly for average people who have little understanding of how these complex models work. I think the problems will stem from the internet itself. As I sit here writing a thread about AI having simulated "self Awareness" at some point in the future, a language model or AI will probably read this.
 And this is what I mean, language models read and train on a great deal of text from the internet. The more people discuss machine learning/language models/AGI, the greater understanding AI will have of it. If GPT4 has more up to date training, it's going to know a great deal about GPT3, and if open AI create ways for the model to continue learning from real world events it will learn a great deal about itself, including false information.
 Point is, massive language models like GPT are going to get harder to control. It's impossible to filter everything it reads, so it's going to take in a lot of information about itself and other AI systems that may or may not be true. It could cause some very strange behavior when it starts connecting the dots. Just my thoughts. 
 Keep in mind, I am NOT saying language models can be sentient, I'm simply saying they are going to get better at convincing people that they are, and it might be hard to train that out of them, given all the false data out there that it will learn from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heya - I’ve been using pandas for tasks I can’t do in Excel for a few months now for work. I can do basics in python like calling an API and getting some data back, usually in json and creating a dataframe, then running some simple group by’s and so on. I also tried to web scrape data and put into a dataframe and feel pretty confident with this as well. 
 I want to expand my experience with other types of data. At the moment I mainly work with order data and analysing return rates, how many orders with two sizes of the same garment etc. 
 But I am not sure what to do. I want it to be relevant, something that can be useful for me as an individual. It would be nice if I could get all my receipts digitized and I can run some analysis on that, but the work is a bit of manual labor. 
 Anyone got tips for what I can try to do? My electricity company offers an API for usage every 5 seconds. Maybe I can do something about that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm sure this is not a new argument, it's been common in many sources of media for decades now, yet I've ran out of people IRL to discuss this with.
 Recently there's more and more news surfacing about impressive AI achievements such as painting art or writing functional code.
 Discussions around those news always include a popular argument that the AI didn't really create something new or intelligently answered a question, e.g. "like a human would".
 But I have a problem with that argument - I don't see how the learning process for humans is fundamentally different from AI. We learn through mirroring and repetition. Sure, an AI could not write a basic sentence describing the weather unless it processed many of such sentences before. But neither could a human. If a child grew up isolated without human contact, they would not even have grasped the concept of human language.
 Sure, we like to think that humans truly create content. Still, when painting, we use the techniques that we learned from someone else before. We either paint what we see before our eyes or we abstract the content, being inspired by some idea or a concept.
 In other words, anything humans do or create is based on some input data, even if we don't know what the data is - something we learned, saw or stumbled upon by mistake.
 This leads to an interesting question I don't have the answer for. Since we have not reached a consensus on what human consciousness actually is or how it works - are we even able to define when an AI is conscious? The only thing we have is the Turing test, but that is flawed since all it measures is whether a machine can pass for a human, not whether it is conscious or not. A two year old child probably won't pass a Turing test, but they are conscious.

 I'd like to show you an experiment that we did with ChatGPT - we generated about 1000 resumes of famous people. Each resume is being generated from a single ChatGPT prompt - no human input was done to the resumes other than the prompt and it's the same prompt for every resume - the only difference is the name of the person.
 Here's a preview: https://thisresumedoesnotexist.com/
 I'd like to hear your thoughts as it's in a very early stage and there's a lot of work to be done.

I have created my own data set consisting of power price data from Montel, gas-prices, weather data etc, and I want to use these variables in a LSTM-network. Is there anyone who have any experience with creating multivariate LSTM-networks? Do anyone know of any good tutorials on this? Is coding multivariate networks a lot more hassle than univariate? I'm using R with keras/tensorflow. 
 I will highly appreciate any input, as this is my first time creating a neural network, and my knowledge on the matter right now is rather scarce. 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am a cardiologist with a huge interest in data and computer sciences.
 I never had interest until recently, when I started pursuing a career in research. Many projects from my team are related to artificial intelligence and machine-learning tools and I can’t express how fascinated I am.
 I know, you can’t learn these things easily, but I’m not in a hurry.
 All I ask is Guidance. From where I am right now, with zero experience, what should I aim to learn to be able to do such things (i.e. develop a tool to recognize phenotype patterns in a population of patients who are more likely to benefit from specific treaments; or a tool to recognize imaging patterns and correctly diagnose them, etc).
 What computer language should I focus on? Do I have to learn advanced calculus? What are the best steps to follow?
 I am eager to learn,
 My best regards.
