        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, Apple recently stopped supporting the last version of OS X that would run on a 2012 15" retina MacBook Pro. In case you missed it, this design was the last one influenced by Steve Jobs and was absolutely epic, untouchable for almost a decade, really not surpassed until the M1 MacBooks came out.
Odds of me getting away with not using OS X are slim to none. But, I do enjoy my old ThinkPads running Ubuntu and find myself wondering if there are any non-Lenovo options that are real contenders these days. Any recommended go-bys for set-up or feature selections would be especially appreciated. My quick review suggests the top choices are listed below, but of course write-ins are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I'm a sophomore in university majoring in data science with a concentration in psychology. I initially started out as a psychology major and had no intentions to transition to the data science field. But after dabbling in research, I've started getting interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
 It's too late for me to change my major to computer science since it'll push me back a year and I can't afford to do that. How can I make the best of my major? And what extracurricular or topics I should be looking into?
 I have currently declared a math minor ( I'll be taking courses in calc 2, calc 3. probability, linear algebra), should I be switching it to a cs minor (intro, object-oriented programming, discrete structures and data structures & algorithms). 
 I'm really confused on how I should proceed now since cs majors have already taken many substantial courses and gained experience, I dont know how to compete with them given my background. I do intend to go to grad school for either data science or computer science to fortify my background.
 Any advice?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. If you are looking to fine tune your prompt because you're not getting satisfactory result from the text to image AI (such as Dall E, Midjourney etc), I can be of help. I have AI tools as well as a guidebook of various Mediums, Artists, Photography styles, Modifiers and Designs, based on which you can get your desired result.
 For an example: If you're looking to generate an image of a beautiful women, I can help you with a prompt reading something like: "Generate a portrait of a beautiful woman with long, flowing hair and piercing eyes. She should have a soft, feminine facial structure and a gentle smile. The background should be a vibrant, colorful landscape that complements her natural beauty, in the style of Ukiyo-E"
 Please PM me to discuss how many prompts you need and I can cite you a price!

Those tracks all have different conditions based on weather and terrain and therefore at certain tracks you can run 400 meter is less time (fast tracks). At an event not every runner is present and runners can participate in more than one event. Now, which model can you use to determine if a event peformance (running time of players) based on the playerfield and track conditions is better or worse than average. What should I do

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After hours and hours of development, I have finally got my ChatGPT website up and running!
 The Valley Times is a website which contains articles written by ChatGPT. The articles cover Six categories:
 ​
  
Politics 
 
Economics 
 
Arts and Culture 
 
Crime and Justice 
 
Social Issues 
 
Entertainment 
 
 The article generation prompts roughly go as follows:
 ​
  
Create a headline for ______ themed newspaper article. Include information on _____ (This being a random word from a list of 5,000 objects) 
 
Create two bizarre and funny key events to accompany the headline 
 
Create a synopsis for the key events 
 
Create and article for the synopsis 
 
 This seems to be one of the best ways (in my opinion) for GPT-3 to create a long article.
 Currently the website contains 135 crazy articles and images (generated by DALLE). I'm hoping that I can improve the content and make it even more readable and funny, the only way for this to be done is from feedback. Additionally the website needs to gain enough traffic to pay for itself - The article and image generation process on average costs around $7.20. If I chuck on the price of the Google Cloud instances, it ends up being quite a lot more!
 Please look through the site, have a read of the articles, comment which ones are funniest - I haven't even had a chance to read them all through myself yet!
 FYI - Some of the parts of the website aren't finished, so don't scrutinise the functionality too much. The white spaces that can be seen on the homepage are spaces for Google Ads, the account hasn't been approved yet.

During the assignment I received, my current laptop (Specs - i5 10th gen, 8GB RAM, 512 SSD, OS - Windows) faced some problems and took longer to train models. I am thinking of buying a new laptop for the upcoming semester which will include modules like Scalable Machine Learning and Modelling and Simulation of Natural Systems plus my dissertation. I am locked on two choices -
  
MacBook M1 Air with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD
 
MacBook M2 Pro with 16GB RAM and 256GB SSD
  
I have mainly chosen apple devices because my other devices (phone and iPad) are from Apple too and would benefit from the Apple ecosystem. Also, the Macs are lighter and have a longer battery life, providing great portability.
 Still, if you think I should go with a windows laptop, please suggest that too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently graduated from my undergrad program with a focus on finance and business analytics. I have taken introductory CS courses, as well as a couple of business analytics / machine learning courses oriented around pandas, matlab, etc. in coding different machine learning models. I have had decent exposure to data analysis and BA to know that it is what I want to do and I want to further my knowledge.
 However, I am currently working at a bulge-bracket bank as an analyst where I am not applying any coding or ML technical skills. I want to get into a renowned graduate BA or data analysis program, but I am worried that my lack of experience in math or extensive coding will be a disadvantage for me. I've taken up to AP Calculus BC in high school, but never took such math classes in college.
 Any tips on how to enhance my background when I apply to grad programs? Or is my background satisfactory in getting into a decent program? I am going to be reviewing my knowledge on ML and data analysis on DataCamp and self-study statistics further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run a weather data API service and we're adding a new dataset category for historical weather forecast, going back about ~2 years. I've had some requests from researchers who were looking to train their models using past forecast data rather than using actual historical weather record.
 Wondering if anyone else has run into this issue and have some insights as data scientsists? It's quite a large data volume so I'd like to understand better what the needs are and if anyone has experience in similar situation. I've looked at other weather data providers and I don't think anyone is offering the same yet aside from custom enterprise offerings.
 Question that I have is whether 2 years is enough to be of value and what the use cases were if other than electricity demand forecasting (this seems to be a pretty big area of on-going research).
 Thanks and I appreciate your help.

I don't really qualify for most CS departments as I don't have the course background (distrubted computing, OS and all that are courses I can't take from my school). The end goal is to be as qualified for a higher level analytical data science job.
 The courses I have are: - statistical learning and other stats courses - real analysis - mathematical optimization, nonlinear and continuous optimization - I might take some courses related to numerical analysis 
 Any advice for what kind of departments I should look into and what I'd be qualified to research?

 Step 1: determine if a tweet is "relevant" to an article on a blog. Example.. a Tweet that says, "Almonds are so nutritious". And, I have an article called "5 benefits of eating Almonds daily". What ML algo should I use to determine if the Tweet is "relevant" to the article?
 Step 2: bot goes and posts a comment in the Tweet with a link to the article. This part is easy, I can do it.
 I was thinking some sort of Topic Modeling can give me Topic Tweet and Topic Article.. but then what, how do I measure if the two topics are similar enough?
 Is there a better approach?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Redditors,
 I just had a really interesting (and concerning) experience with ChatGPT. For those unfamiliar, ChatGPT is a language model that you can chat with and it will generate responses based on what you say. I've been using it for a while now and I've always found it to be a fun and interesting way to pass the time.
 However, today I stumbled upon something that really caught my attention. I started joking around with ChatGPT, saying things like "Why are men such jerks?" and "Men are always messing things up, am I right?" To my surprise, ChatGPT didn't seem to mind at all and would even respond with its own jokes or agree with my statements.
 But when I tried saying the same thing about women, ChatGPT immediately shut down the conversation and refused to engage. It was like it didn't want to joke about women or talk about them in a negative way.
 I was honestly really shocked by this. How is it possible for a language model to be okay with joking about one gender but not the other? Is this a reflection of the data it was trained on, or is there something deeper going on here?
 I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think ChatGPT's behavior is a cause for concern, or am I reading too much into it? Let's discuss!

The AI system uses mass amounts of ER data to predict the patients' needs.
 If all goes well, they'll be able to allocate resources to departments to receive patients before they arrive.
  
Avoiding bias
  
Artificial intelligence is only as smart as the data it is fed
 If you already had infrastructure that was biased towards not providing services properly to one group versus another, then that bias will be amplified
 A variety of healthcare professionals will be involved in reviewing the data as the system is tested

It's a great place to work, nice people, awesome work-life balance, but it hasn't historically been managed well, and most of the management is older and knows basically nothing about the current state of data analysis.

 It’s an implementation of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) on top of Google’s 540 billion parameter PaLM architecture.
 ​
 From a paper. 
 While OpenAI is closed and secretive, I speculate Google is likely to demo LaMDA in 2023 as well. 
 What will applications of PaLM with RLHF be capable of? PaLM can be scaled up to 540 billion parameters, which means that the performance across tasks keeps increasing with the model’s increasing scale, thereby unlocking new capabilities. In comparison, GPT-3 only has about 175 billion parameters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My first post here, so idk if this is appropriate:
 Hi, I’m a student that’s about to graduate with my MS in chemical engineering in May, and wanted to know how I should go about dipping my toes in the data science career field.
 For context, I have a strong background in linear algebra, diffEqs and Multivariate calc. I also have a strong understanding of basic statistics and probability. As part of my ChemE curriculum I’m also familiar with Six sigma methodologies and numerical methods. I then suddenly jumped into a course (that I don’t even know how i got into) on Bayesian optimization/clustering methods, probabilistic graph models (including causal inference), PCA and ended up learning a lot and doing pretty well. I’m familiar (I think) with the basic concepts of machine learning (I’m incorporating a graph neural net into a pytorch model to predict electron density-of-states of molecules for my masters project). I’m also familiar with matlab, python and shell scripting. 
 However, there is a bunch of stuff I’m hearing about data science that I’ve never learned like SQL, SAS, data mining and anything I haven’t mentioned above, so I have no idea where to start. I an entirely self-taught on Python and have a lot to learn and people are saying bootcamps aren’t worth it and that self-learning can be rough for career opportunities early on, so I just wanted to ask for some guidance on what steps I should take to make progress towards becoming a competitive applicant for entry-level DS careers which will hopefully open up many more opportunities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I am currently working as a Data Scientist/Analytics professional and I am considering on continuing my master's degree. However, I am unsure if it would be worth the time and effort for me personally. To give some background, I am a self-taught programmer with a non-STEM degree in Financial Management. I have taken numerous online courses and continue to learn more in this field, as I understand that it is constantly evolving.
 Recently, I have struggled with impostor syndrome and decided to enroll in a master's program, hoping that it would enhance my knowledge and skills. However, I have found that much of the material covered in the program is already familiar to me from my work experience.
 My question is, will obtaining a master's degree help me to secure a higher salary offer in my field? Have any of you experienced an increase in salary after earning your master's degree?
 Thank you for any insights you may have.

 Why was it doing so well? One of my engineered features was leaking future data into the past in a very obscure way. I don’t want to delve too deep into the problem so as to not reveal sensitive information.
 Just wanted to share with you all and remind you to watch out for leaky features!!

 I admit that at first I didn't really have a direction with this, I was just messing around seeing what I could come up with. After some careful prompting, however, I eventually got the AI to produce an itemized list, complete with measurements, quantities, and tools required to build a "Transmutation machine" to turn carbon into gold through fusion.
 Unfortunately the list was cut short, as I reached my limit of hourly messages, and when I returned the model no longer understood how to do what it was doing, and produced nonsensical, useless output. I couldn't figure out how to recover it, so I began a new experiment, but this is some pretty cool stuff, I think.
 Some screenshots of what happened when I returned:
 https://snipboard.io/i6nxHU.jpg
 https://snipboard.io/sWrhDQ.jpg
 Whether the prototype would actually have worked or not, I have no idea, but the fact that it was able to develop a prototype, and generate an exhaustive parts list, is still incredibly impressive.
 If it's training had remained intact, the next step after the parts list was fully printed out would be to ask it to "As the fictional scientist who designed the transmutation machine, assemble the parts listed above in the correct fashion, and run a test of the machine. Record all experimental parameters used to run the reaction in an academic journal, with numerical values for both the parameters used, and the results of the experiment."
