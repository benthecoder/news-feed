        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am solving a regression case for an interview. They gave a dataset with 12 features and 800 observations. I made a regression model in LightGBM and it performed really well in the validation dataset. 
 The problem is that it is the only model I made and I would like to try more things to show to my interviewer. Some thoughts:
 ​
  
I thought about making a traditional linear regression to compare LightGBM with but the data they gave does not hold the assumptions of a linear model (i.e. residuals not normally dist.)
 I thought about XGBoost but, as far as I know, its performance is similar to LightGBM but LightGBM is faster and uses less memory
 Neural networks are not even considered given the size of the dataset
  
The instructions of the case say that the company is not so well interested in the prediction itself. They explicit say that the approach used to solve the task is more important than the prediction, especially because the data was randomly generated. In this case should I stress with making more models? 
 Given that the instructions talk about the approach, I did an extensively EDA, stated all my findings, why I chose to use LightGBM, etc.

I wanted to know what route to take, I basically self taught myself medicine and wondered if i should just follow a roadmap or should i go to formal schooling and get a certificate. If there's any other route as well, please let me know or any thoughts that you guys might have. I really just want to get started on the journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I now have a few projects under my belt in Jupyter Lab/Notebook and want to move them to Github, but i'm not sure about how much of the project I should be showing. 
  
Do I need to include all of the code even where I am just cleaning and preprocessing the raw files?
 Some of the data I worked with is confidential company data, how can I show it in my project and talk about the results without breaching company privacy?
  
I couldn't find any clear info on this online. If anyone has any tips on this or about how to format a github project in general that would be helpful! Thank you for your time.

I thought about maybe connect it to tableau and put parameters to limit what they can show/ pull down to csv at once, but sounded like they are interested to do exploration on the entire dataset since it’s so new. For more color, we have tableau, power BI, and Databricks. 
 Is there a good way or a tool to deal with this? Appreciate any advice

 I'm not very tech savvy either but I've listened to the recent A.I. voice recordings and heard that they use input text to work (if I'm not mistaken?).
 So with that in mind would it be possible to copy-paste a files text in it and have the A.I. read it into a recording?
 The reason I want to do this is because often I have to read a lot for my projects and would sometimes like to listen to information rather than being on my screen for 10 hours locked inside my home so if I could self create these form of audio files it would benefit me extremely.

It is a data science degree apprenticeship, but most of my time so far has been spent doing data engineering in pyspark on a dataset of about 3.5 billion (creating methods and implementing them to get our desired outputs)
 While I’m doing this, I want to get some experience in ML and therefore start my own ML project in my own time to further my skills/development. Are there any particular courses/videos/exercises that you particularly like and think are helpful to get started?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been building a project with the goal of adding it to my resumé but I'm not sure the results are anything to be proud of. Here's the Github repo: https://github.com/miguelscarv/opinions
 The project has to do with entity sentiment analysis, pretty much predicting sentiment on a document about a certain entity (like a person, company, product, etc...) using active learning. The data was scrapped with the Twitter API, so yeah the data is tweets.
 I scrapped 500 tweets about Elon Musk and saved the 100 most recent tweets as a test set and the remaining 400 tweets acted as my training set. I then used a roberta model finetunned for sentiment analysis on tweets (https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest) and it got 57% accuracy out of the box. Mind you that this is a 3 class classification task.
 The cool thing about my project is that it uses active learning to recommend tweets for someone to label with the goal of getting a better model with the least amount of labeled tweets possible. So using the training set I labeled 40 tweets and got my accuracy on the test set up to 66% - a 9% increase in accuracy because I labeled 40 tweets. Now my question is: is that good?
 The model I used was already finetunned for sentiment analysis and I just further fine tuned it. the training loop looks something like: the active learning policy asks a user to label 8 tweets (this is the batch size) and once they are labeled it updates the model and uses that model to recommend another 8 tweets for a user to label.
 The number doesn't really sound good enough to add to my resumé, but tbh I was surprised I got that improvement because there are a lot of tweets about Elon Musk that are hard to label, even for a human....

 Hey everyone! Wanted to share a platform a few others & myself have been working on: an easy way to build apps on top of AI Large Language Models such as GPT-3. This video shows the simplest app you can build -- just take one of your great ChatGPT prompts and quickly turn it into a shareable app with an interface anyone can use. You can also chain LLMs together, feed in data from outside sources, and a whole lot more. We have found a lot of value in this community, and so wanted to give you all early access before we release it on a wider scale: Agent Beta Access. Would love any feedback! Btw, here is the app in the video (it's a fun one!): King James Bible Verse Generator.

 The general feeling is that for the most part it should be “light touch” and based on risk - so asking medical questions is high risk and tightly regulated, asking for a poem is low risk.
 There is also concerns GDPR could come into play and a company like OpenAI could be forced to delete its model and training data if enough people complain.

It's been a huge rewrite to get this working on Linux and Windows from our original Mac and Metal code.
We also have some interesting uses of cross-platform Swift + Electron in our plugin manager app, and cross-platform Swift generally in the plugin. Hopefully we can detail that in a blog post at some point.
There's a free Filmbox Lite version to try, if you're interested.

 I have been taking an Applied Statistics certificate course at my local university and also the Google Data Analytics course on Coursera. The thing is I’m wondering if this is enough or if I am wasting my time. Should I keep taking courses on Coursera or am I just wasting my time? Is it possible for someone with no experience and an unrelated degree to get a job with just certificates? 
 I would like to get my Masters but I was hoping to get in the field first. I’m currently looking at the Master of Science in Data Science from University of Colorado Boulder. It is online and also on Coursera. 
 Is going the Masters route the best option? 
 For those with no previous experience of the field, how did you start?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 So here is some background. I graduated in Dec 2021 with BSCS (3.7 GPA). I accepted an offer at a Bank as System Analyst (mostly doing Project management and writing queries for reporting).
 So far the salary is good, great benefits and it's a remote job. I only work 4hrs a day and my bosses are pretty happy with my performance. Rest of my day I just learn backend stuff, LC practices, or some cooking videos.
 Lately, I am thinking about going back to school part-time for MS in DS, or something else. My company can pay 4k per year for a master's so why not utilize it? I saw a few job postings at my company for DS jobs which motivates me towards this.
 I am thinking to apply @ UIUC for the MCS DS program, as it's just an hour away and has a good reputation.
 So here are some questions:
  
Are there any other self-paced well reputed schools for MS?
 Finally, if you have any other advice which you might think I should know then please let me know.
 Are there internships for the DS role? (When I was in college I hardly saw any DS internships) 
  
My focus is to get as many DS internships within the company or outside of the company, and what I've noticed is most companies don't offer internships unless one is enrolled in school and pursuing BS, MS, or Ph.D.
 In the end thanks for your attention. I appreciate your insight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Preface: I'm on month 6 of being the first data scientist at this professional services firm and it's a total nightmare. All the worst symptoms of a badly managed 'innovation' team: swapping priorities just when i get into a groove with a project, an ad-hoc project management framework, management agreeing to deadlines without taking feedback on how reasonable or how much effort projects will take, management dropping messages in my inbox with suggestions on shiny low-code tools that they think would be interesting to try out (they are not), management not hiring more staff even though they agree that my position should be split up into at least 2 roles, management asking me to produce work that doesn't ever get used by anyone, etc. I'm quickly planning my exit strategy but have this immediate fire that i need to put out.
 The biggest issue at hand is that the person playing Product Owner is strangleholding me into working on project for which there is currently no data to work with. Product Owner's "strategy" for getting data is that when the beta app is built, we'll use the documents that clients upload into the app. However, these documents are highly confidential, and the project will require sending the documents to a third-party vendor for data labeling and re-training the head of a large language model. Product Owner has not indicated at all that these clients will be notified that their documents will be sent to third-party vendors. I know enough about IP law to know there's something off with this situation, but don't have the verbiage to know what to ask for, how to ensure Product Owner did their due diligence, etc. What is within my role as Data Scientist to ask Product Owner that this potential data source will be lawful to work with?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have noticed that I am getting more and more addicted to consuming information so I am listening to podcasts while working and I watch Youtube videos in my free time. This is all fun and interesting but I feel this makes me want to do things less and less. Instead of working on my own problems I distract myself by listening to ever more information. I get a lot of benefit from this information but somehow it feels shallow.
I think part of it is that my work is quite uninteresting and doesn't really keep my mind engaged. But the work is tedious enough that I am too tried in the evening to do something interesting. After a few years everything feels like it's a repeat.
Does anybody else feel that way? Have you been able to detach yourself from the constant flow of information and focus on your own stuff?

I don't seem to be having too much luck with Data Science jobs, I understand that while Data Engineers still work closely with Data Scientists and Analysts that they require different skill sets. If I were to keep practising my Data Science skills could I still expect a data science-like job in the future or should I expect to stay in data engineering if I take this job?

 Any advice is appreciated, thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So if you search something now you usually end up on a website that runs ads to pay for servers, editors etc. However, if ChatGPT and Bard will be fully implemented into Bing and Google, there is no need to visit these websites anymore because you get the answer you need right away. Wouldn't that result in a shitton of websites closing down, which then results in AIs having a harder time to get their hand on correct information?

 “The individual will not engage in any trade or business in competition with the company for the first 12 months after the end of their employment. This includes working on their own or on behalf of someone else.”
 This is for a generic data science company that consults in almost all aspects of data science. Does this mean if I leave I technically can not join any other company as a data scientist?
 How would I ask them to alter this or remove or completely as it sounds to me like I can’t really leave unless I move into a non data science company…

 Searching online there are good reviews and it's one one of the best growing startups but I don't know anyone using it. So my question is, is Dataiku widely used in as the numbers say? It would be great to get some advices from people already using it.

 Then the website brings me to a new page where they ask a few basic questions which I answer truthfully and in a positive way. Until I reach: "Do you have any experience with Federated Learning?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there.
 I currently have a working VR bot which uses whisper AI to take in speech from within a VR social platform and converts that into text which is then passed to the GPT-3 Davinci model and the output of that is passed to IBM Watson TTS and then spoken by the bot via a virtual audio cable within the VR platform.
 However after experimenting with the prompts for the bot it's apparent you can do just about anything with them even down to getting the bot to know it's own hair and eye color [which corresponds to it's appearance in VR] and all manner of other useful things you can get it to remember.
 With how powerful this is I was curious if there was a limit to how much I could actually add to it and if there are any downsides because if there isn't I could spend a lot of time making this bot perfect purely with prompts alone.

 My confusion stems from my assumption that when survey results are presented as percentages, the sum should be 100%. As far as I know, the percentages of this graph sum to 883%.
 I tried to research ways that survey results can be visualized, but the only one that I found could explain this graph was cumulative percentages. Even then, I still don't understand the numbers.
