        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im looking to get a data science internship as a junior finance major. I recently have gotten interested in data science and It’s too late for me to switch or double major. I have added a data science minor, but I have only taken two coding related classes. I really want to get an internship this summer because I feel like it will be much harder to get into the industry later on. Is it at possible I can get an internship in the industry and if not what should I do moving forward?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I just started product manager role in small <100 ppl company. In my team we’re doing government R&D project normally collecting / preprocess / labeling the data. It’s been 8 months since I’ve come here. I started as a data labeler, and later CEO gave me data wrangling task. (I’ve been studying data science stuff since the last year on my own) When I completed the data wrangling project, my coworkers who worked with me all left the company. And now CEO wants me to take PM job and start the government R&D project. 
 It’s the solution company, so we’re doing multiple project at the same time. I like to experience many different domain, but in this project I need to give the guidance to the juniors who recently come in this company. Even I’m still the junior. I want to go to the grad school to get master’s degree in machine learning in this year. But if I couldn’t get the scholarship I should work longer.
 So here is my question: 1. The product that we’re building is not great quality. Will it benefit my career?
  
Can I switch from PM to data scientist in near future?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context
 The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.
 Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.
 Content
 Full tweet texts are provided with their labels for training data.Mentioned users' username is replaced with @user.

I've always enjoyed onboarding, teaching, and mentoring Data Scientists and Data Analysts. I've worked primarily in marketing/advertising but my passion has always been sports!
 So, I've decided to create a course that I wish someone created for me when I first got into data science: "Learn Data Science Through Sports". This is absolutely a work in progress and I actually cannot wait to keep expanding this. But I would love some feedback/bring my course to light for anyone that it can help!
 Right now it is just hosted on my Github (I would like to create a website for it in the future). And here it is: https://github.com/ant-vessicchio/learn_data_science_through_sports 
 Scroll right down to the README for the curriculum. Thank you so much for reading and I appreciate any feedback!

 We’ve developed a pretty cool app that offers AI services like image generation, code generation, image captioning, and more for free. We’re sort of like a Swiss Army knife of generative and analytical AI.
 We’ve released a new feature called AAIA (Ask AI Anything), which is capable of answering all types of questions, even requests to generate literature, story-lines, jokes, general information, etc.
 We’d love to have some people try it out, give us feedback, and keep in touch with us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some background: I did my bachelor's in computer science with a concentration in data science. Recently migrated to the USA. Have very little work experience, and therefore, to maximize my chances of landing a job, I started looking into master degrees.
 Now: I received a fully paid scholarship from UAlbany University in a Master's degree in Information Science, with one of concentration being in Data Analytics. 
 I am looking for opinions on whether I can leverage this degree to land a job as a data analyst and gradually in a data science position, or is it irrelevant to the field/ a red flag to employers? (Information science = libraries?, first time hearing about this particular field)
 TL,DR: Is masters in 'information science' concentration in data analytics a good choice for a career in data science/data analytics, or is it focused on library management only?

We know the feeling all too well. In response, we created https://www.mendable.ai/. Mendable is a GPT-3 (davinci + LangChain) powered developer support AI, designed to provide you with customized answers to your problems in real-time.
 We believe that developer-facing documentation should be tailored to the individual. We ingest documentation, community messages, and resources (blog posts, how-to guides, white papers, etc.) to serve as a middle-man between the entire knowledge base of a piece of software and you, resulting in a GPT like docs search. Our goal is to redefine search, making it easier for you to find the information you need, when you need it. Wasting time searching through outdated documentation is something that should be in the past.

 I’m working on a project where I want to determine after how many days we have the biggest chance of progressing a quote. Our processes works as follows: quote-> commited -> won/lost. I’m trying to create a model that would show after how many days in the quote stage the quote has the biggest probability of making progress to committed stage. Issue I’m having is I have only access to excel and a BI visualization tool. Data I have access to is: current time spent in the stage, from what stage it came and to what stage it went afterwards. I calculated average time it takes a quote to make a progress but have no idea how to create a model that would show me for example that after 20 days we have 65% chance of progressing, while after 50 days the probability goes down to 30%. Any ideas how to approach that?

 Sadly, myself and the user group is not working in the data science realm and would find my solution difficult to work with. (Understandable) 
 Is there a way to make my automated approach more user friendly? How can I share this with my user group without necessarily directly providing them the code? Is this possible, or do they need to learn?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently in graduate school in machine learning and have done really well, but I honestly feel unprepared for a real job. One big reason is while I have done multiple small projects in Github with groups of people, I have never worked on a large repository before. While I have merged branches and a few times used rebase, that is the extent of my Github use. I am worried this lack of experience working with a collaboration is going to hurt me finding a job. I tried getting an internship last year to remedy this issue but they are so competitive I couldn't actually find one. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get up to speed? Anyone up for tutoring me? lol

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I seriously don't know what to do. I've been stuck at this job for 4 years now. I've spent the last 3 (off and on) trying to find a job to no avail. If I'm lucky, I end up being choice #2 or 3. 
 My job is a complete joke. I literally do nothing all day every day. I've had one interesting project the whole time here, and that was near the very beginning. Otherwise it's nothing or shitty monkey work that's worse than nothing. I've tried to reach out to people for something to do, but I'm always ignored. My pay is definitely in the bottom 10%, maybe even the bottom 1% for having a master's and 4 years of "experience". 
 I just have no motivation anymore. What's the point of trying to skill up when I'm just going to forget it anyway, and nobody gives a shit? I got completely burned out on job apps and interviews for close to a year, and I'm just now starting to recover. I don't even feel like working on outside projects at this point; this job has completely killed what I used to love doing. I applied for some PhD programs, because I feel like it's probably the only way to resuscitate my "career" at this point.
 Any advice is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm midcareer DS with ~5 yrs experience in DS in large corporate. I used to be in Analytics for 6 years, and 1.5 yrs in data engineering before pivoting into DS. 
 I want to take an extended break of 4-6 months for some personal reasons. Having worked in fast-faced corporate environment for so long, I'm also starting to feel burnout, so this feels like a good time to take a long break and contemplate my life.
 Although, I've owned/led most of the projects that i worked on, I've always worked as IC and never as people manager. I want to try and apply as manager for DS/analytics team when I'm ready to come back. Here are my questions:
  
 If I start an MBA program specializing in data analytics/science during the break, how much help will it be to landing a manager role? I realize that I wouldn't have completed the course by the time I'm ready to get back into the workforce. I also realize that mid-level management compensation is lower than what I currently make as an IC. 
 What advise, recommendation, etc. that you can give that I can prepare myself for the interview/role? I'm looking for roles that can provide better work-life balance.
  
I was actually ready to go ahead with this plan. But with the economy in recession, I'm starting to rethink my plan. Any advice/recommendation is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My job is to make sure that an online retailer achieves a certain service level (in stock rate) for their products, while avoiding aging and excess stock. I have a robust cost and leadtime simulation model. One of the inputs into that model is a vector of prediction intervals for cumulative demand over the next leadtime weeks. 
 To date, I've been using a handful of traditional forecast methods (TSB [variation of Croston], ETS, ARIMA, etc) including hybrids, using R packages like hybridForecast. My prediction intervals are almost universally much narrow than our actual results (e.g. in a sample of 500 relatively steady-selling items, 20% were below my ARIMA 1% prediction interval, and 12% were above the 99% prediction interval).
 I switched to using simulation + bootstrapping the residuals…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see them all the time, they're usually amazing in terms of compensation, and usually 200+ candidates within a few days. Of the ones that I applied to, I never even hear back. I find it incredibly unlikely that I'll stand out, and it makes me wonder if it's even worth submitting an ad-hoc resume highlighting my relevant expertise if I'm not going to hear back. 
 What do you all do? Take time to tailor the resume for each position? Submit a generic resume that kinda fits the description, in hopes that it'll get you through the door? Not even bother? 
 Sorry if the question is silly, I'm just a little peeved with the whole thing.

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34693233</id>
        <link href="https://www.nango.dev/"/>
        <updated>2023-02-07T14:34:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nango (https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango) provides pre-built OAuth flows, secure token storage and automatic refreshes for 40+ APIs and counting.
Why we built Nango:
We built Nango to solve the pain of accessing OAuth APIs. Despite OAuth being a standard protocol in theory, it remains a major burden to implement it, even with the help of a library. You still need to add endpoints and logic to your app for the server-side dance, implement token refreshes, build & secure your token storage, deal with redirects on the frontend etc.
But the worst part is that (almost) every API has quirks and non-standard behaviour. This is why we think open source and knowledge sharing is key here: With the templates in Nango we capture these edge cases and make sure that OAuth just works.
How it works:
Nango is a small Typescript/Node.js service that handles the OAuth dance, token storage & refreshes for you. It works with any language, API or framework. It is easily self-hostable for free, or as a cloud service if you want to avoid the burden of securing tokens yourself (that’s how we pay the bills). To get started we recommend you take a look at our Quickstart on the GitHub repo: https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango
We currently support 40+ popular APIs. Adding a new one is as simple as updating a YAML file, so anybody can contribute one. In the coming weeks we plan to add a dashboard, a proxy to authorise requests, monitoring and more APIs.
One thing we learned from talking to other engineers about OAuth is that everybody has their own horror stories: What was the hardest OAuth API you ever used? What made it so difficult? We look forward to your stories and your feedback on Nango!

I'm in my second year in the role, and although I enjoyed my first year very much, I've noticed that I've really been not having a good time lately. There are a few reasons for this:
  
I don't have a team. It was pretty fun at first to come in and take care of a lot of low-hanging fruit and answer people's data questions that they'd been stuck with for a long time. But I don't feel like I'm learning anything new anymore, and I'm not experienced enough to figure out how I can make myself progress. My manager is great but does not have a background in data science, and I don't have peers I can discuss my work with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good content is key no matter what type of website or business you run, from blogs to SaaS tools or service based companies. Not only will it help you to rank higher in Google for the relevant keywords, but it also helps to attract visitors by providing them something of value for free to convert them into your funnel with a newsletter or free trial. Usually creating this content either required a lot of time, a lot of money, or both. That is why I launched https://writeseed.com
 It is powered by GPT-3 to create content for you with the help of AI. You only need to provide it with a general niche or keyword and it will provide you with a selection of blog post outlines, which are then used to write a complete 1,000+ word article. You also get a free stock photo which is relevant to the topic each time. The quality of the content is so good, I often get the feedback that people are surprised this is possible at all.
 We achieve these results by using our own proprietary fine-tuning, as well as a special way of processing your input and the output from GPT-3. It took me half a year of research and comparing the outputs of other AI writing tools to get to this point and I am really proud of the result.
 Besides blog articles the platform offers over 20 templates of content, from product descriptions to Tweets, cold emails, Quora answers, questions, jokes, stories, paraphrasing or summarizing your existing content, auto-correct spelling and grammar, press releases, real-estate listings. And we continuously add new templates to cover even more use-cases.
 On top of that we are one of the very few, maybe the only tool, which offers you unlimited content for a flat monthly price. Some of our users are creating 200+ full-length articles per month to rank their websites or run Amazon product blogs.
 Please give it a try with the 7-day free trial, of course you can also create unlimited content during the free trial!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There have been a few posts of this sub arguing for the description of a data scientist being confined to a singular definition. It is therefore worth starting a thread on the scientific position of “data science” as a field. This is not a peer reviewed work, but we can at least use it to get the conversation going. 
 Thomas Kunz defines budding paradigms as a time of fuzzy definition until the field rights itself and clearly defines itself through discussion of what is within its scope of function. He uses the example of textbooks to demonstrate that this is a method of inculcating new members into the discipline. Is that enough to clearly define a data scientist in present context? There are so many “how to do x like a data scientist” type discussions and books. Hopefully we are at the tail-end of the “peak of anticipation” and getting deeper into the “Trough of disillusionment” of the Gartner Hype Cycle. Thoughts, gang?
