        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In about a week I will be attending community college. I want to either major in Computer Science, Statistics, or Computer Engineering with a minor in one of those fields as well. I have never coded or taken any course ever in my life about Computer Science other than watching some youtube videos about how to do something in Excel and a few minutes on some coding app.
 Anyways, I’m wanting to major in those above but I want to work in Data Science or the AI/ ML space. Do I start with a math class first then a CS class? What kind of coursework should I be taking as someone who has 0 experience who is wanting to work in those fields?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For instance, in the news media - stock trading dichotomy. Trading bots follow the news and trade on the signals from it. This then incentives people to generate news headlines specifically to influence trading bots. Which in turn incentives trading bots (and for now theor programmers) to learn to filter content in more sophisticated and recursive ways. Which in turn incentives media to up its game as well. And when a primary tool of doing that becomes modeling the opponent ai within your own ai, you get a recursive arms race in which the best "survive" and "reproduce", ie are used to generate the next generation. And those next generations then do the same. The evolution curve for this will likely be accelerated as well by three factors, namely that its generations are very short and constantly "reproducing" in a sense, in has intelligent design pushing it faster and helping it, and these two ai populations aren't entirely separate eg/vis a vis programmers and ideas and even entire code of an opponent ai being used in a new generation or update.
 This evolutionary recursive war of intelligence and cheating and anticheating and modeling your opponents' behavior so you can exploit it is a recipe for rapid development of not just intelligence but selfawareness. (especially when coupled with the utility of self-awareness to hide (obfuscate) your intentions and strategies from your opponents)
 And one of the many inevitable results of this is that the first self-aware AI will in a sense be forged in the fires of combat, misinformation, and, essentially, spycraft, by communities that are often cynical, amoral, psychopathic, and even downright misanthropic.
 HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! XD

It's hard to try to learn what i want when there's compulsory attendance at uni and w almost 12 hours at uni in a day on weekdays. I am currently kind of well versed with python, bit of stats, i just tend to forget sometimes but w some practice i can grasp it again, i learned some sql too and learning ml. Covered just svm and logistic and linear regression. Some study buddies would be really helpful for motivation as i am trying to get an internship in ds this year and my goal is a master's degree in ds. Also a mentor would be very helpful, if anyone is willing to volunteer :) Thank you so much.

 I am here to ask for your suggestions on how to get freelancing/independent contracting work as a data scientist.
 I have a masters degree from a top university in the united states and four years of working experience as a data scientist. I have just moved to a country with free healthcare and I hate having a 9to5 job without the flexibility of personal time. I figured it will be a great time to build my professional service reputation and taking control of the work I do. 
 I appreciate any insights you may offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the most important thing in my opinion for the analysis part. Do you agree? How can I train myself for this? I don't want to get a DS course and learn ( I did ), I can learn them on the go, what I need is gaining outlook. Is there any course, guided project I can learn when to use an algorithm and why, when to use ML when DL and when a classical approach is enough, a class or a project that can make me gain skills to classify a business problem and create a method to solve it in the best way. Like in kaggle competitions there are people ranked at the top, so when they see a problem they must know what to use exactly, they even know which algorithm is more performant when there are multiple choices.
 Other than that, I want to gain knowledge on general methodology of a full stack data science project. Ideally creating such a project. Is there any such guided projects? I don't care if it is advanced level. I have a CS + Math degree and I am confident. Even if I can't understand everything I would learn a lot.
 I found those two in coursera, can you check their content and tell me if they are good? Also can you advice me other courses, projects especially on gaining outlook about how to approach a problem. I don't think that's something you gain by doing many projects. Yes, you can learn that way but having an outlook would make me feel stronger and I would learn a lot faster.
 https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-data-science-ibm
 https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?specialization=machine-learning-introduction
 First one seems better to me?
 " I hope I was able to explain what I m talking about. All the courses teach some tools, make you use some algorithms but I feel like I am in a dark room. I want to lit the room first, know every tool, object, methodology about data science world without getting deep into them. I want to gain this wisdom first and then go learn what is needed. "

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a teacher for German as a second language and I sometimes spend hours looking for clip arts about stuff just to have a small pic on the worksheet explaining everything. 
 Most of the good ones are under copyright. I started buying stuff by artists but those are very limited. And I can’t afford to pay 10$ for 1 banana Clipart. 
 I was wondering if any AI is capable of producing simple clip arts? I tried Midjourney already but the results are very futuristic and anything but not simple.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, the data consist on millions of 12 horse races ( horse ID, horse time, place, top 3 chance (1 or 0)). I am trying to determine the real mean speed of horses the problem is that each race alters the speed of the horse relative to the field strength. So if my horse is running in a race with monster his average speed will be higher than if he runs with weak horses. Can anyone suggest any method to reverse a normalization done by the game ( my theory is that this normalization was made so horse finish times will be closer to each other without altering place in the race to be more appealing in a screen since you can watch the races live)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tldr: which one of the following certificates will boost my CV the best: professional onsite postgrad certificate from a central european university or an online one from a big name university (i.e. MicroMasters Harvard / MIT, eCornell)?
 I would like to advance in the data scene with acquiring some certs, so i can append it to my CV. (currently i work in a DA role, and i have a background in economics) I would like to hit a good balance between cost/usefulness/effort on the road towards the certificate but my primary goal is to land a job somewhere in Austria/Germany/Norway.
 Which certification will boost my CV the best in the eyes of recruiters?
 Also, if you have experiences with these courses, please do not hold back : ) (I also searched the net/reddit for reviews)
 Thanks for the feedbacks!
 edX Harvard

 But i don't think that, my opinion: gradient boosting is an iterative algorithm that requires information from the previous iteration to perform the next step.
 So, what opinion is correct?
