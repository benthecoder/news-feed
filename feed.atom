 Neural networks are a collection of algorithms that simulate the functions of the human brain to find connections among enormous volumes of data. Convolutional neural networks, however, are a particular kind of deep learning neural network used in image identification and computer vision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please read if I made the right purchase because I'm really not good at spending money on myself. So I want opinions. Haven't even opened the box yet. 
 Not for gaming and I understand people always say you train your deep learning models on a cluster and I agree. 
 But I wanted to get into cuda, pycuda, clara, frameworks from nvidia and wanted a new laptop because my generic surface gave up after more than half a decade of improvising. 
 Plus for basic prototyping in DL, and machine learning code optimization using pycuda, I believed it would be nice to have a local device where I can learn all this without having to move data between clusters and my device. 
 Macs can't do cuda so they were out. And I didn't want some weird gamey built like asus, razers have bad thermals, Alienware in the same price range has i7 not i9 cpu plus felt plasticky.
 Legion 7i looked, felt pretty solid, metal chassis, decent thermals and specs. But open to reconsider within the 15 day period if need be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, my very first blog post - "Learning to Imitate" - is available to read on the Stanford AI blog.
 The blog post offers an easy & insightful read for anyone interested in AI. It highlights issues with current AI systems and ways to create better human-centric AI by using data-driven learning.
 It also presents our new framework "Inverse Q-Learning", which forms a major theoretic advance over Inverse Reinforcement Learning, to train AI agents using sparse data. This framework has also been used to create the best AI agent for playing Minecraft using a few expert demos.
 Please read and share!! Happy to answer any follow-ups here or on DM 😊

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's my hot take.
 Data Scientist (--): Data scientist jobs are facing a few headwinds. Data scientists are oftentimes (but not always) the farthest from the value proposition and thus their impact is harder to quantify. This is manifested in some companies trimming or cutting their DS teams during this downturn, especially if data is not integral to the company's mission. Furthermore, after a decade of hype in data, schools are now churning out BA and MA graduates with DS majors. DS jobs will NOT go away tomorrow, and senior (7+ yr exp) data scientists in data-focused organizations will be much more insulated than those just entering the field or in companies where data is an afterthought. But it seems to be the case that both the supply and demand for DS jobs are showing signs of shift…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of our company's vendors is trying to sell us on a subscription to put a model they built into our sales pipeline, and I have no idea how to evaluate whether it's worth it.
 For context, our powers-that-be gave this other company our data on our sales and marketing (what kinds of marketing and sales efforts resulted in more sales). This company created a model that gives a score to different activities based on how likely they are to result in more sales (being purposely vague because I work in a niche industry so my company might be easy to guess). They will present their findings to us, then try to convince us to pay for it.
 My boss wants me to help with evaluating whether it's worth the money. 
 I'm way out of my comfort zone. I have a background in business and data analysis, and I've built a handful of my own models while following along with tutorials. But otherwise, I'm a data science noob and I'm not knowledgeable enough to scrutinize this deal.
 How should I prep for this presentation? What kinds of questions should I be asking? And what should I learn about in the next couple of weeks to make sure I understand whatever responses they throw at me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weird observation and hypothetical discussion for you all.
 I am surprised that I haven't seen the term "full stack" creep into data science job titles yet. I imagine there would be a big need for "full stack" data scientists, especially at small to medium sized companies who don't want to build out big data teams. 
 I guess I would imagine a full stack DS to be someone who can do everything from engineering, to analysis, to machine learning. In 2022, a baseline tech stack might be:
 -Python (PySpark, Pandas, scikit, a few plotting libs)
 -SQL
 -TensorFlow or PyTorch
 -Knowledge of a cloud platform (AWS/GCP/Azure)
 -Knowledge of Docker + Kubernetes for deployment
 -strong software engineering fundamentals
 -strong statistics / analytics knowledge
 -domain knowledge + presentation skills

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I wanted to ask if anyone has any recommendations around data architecture selections on a tight budget. 
 I am fairly junior having worked 2 years as a data analyst and am hoping to secure a position as a data scientist at a non-profit, which currently has no data specialists or data infrastructure, so I am expecting that I will have to sort things out around architecture, data management, strategy etc. I don’t have much insights about the data at this time unfortunately, but the organization is fairly large and has over a hundred partner organizations, in which I suspect they receive csv files and reports from. I suspect it would be beneficial to compile these using something like a data lake, among other things like publicly available data and 3rd party data, while down the line focusing on organizing / normalizing the data and maybe incorporating more expensive solutions like warehousing.
 If anyone has experience working on architecture on a small budget and with small to modest amounts of data I would be so grateful for recommendations or lessons learned. 
 Thank you so much for any advice you can provide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a Finance major and I was looking to shift into business/data analytics and I have some questions about such.
  
From what I've read Business Analytics also makes use of some Python, R, SQL for data manipulation but is mostly surface level stuff used to make business decisions while Data Analytics goes a lot more into depth on the data side and mathematics?
 I was looking on indeed for Business Analytics job postings and none of them mention any sort of Python, R or SQL programming, just generic business job description. Why is that?
 Is it worth it for me as Finance major to go into a Business Analytics masters in order to transition into the field or can I skip the cost (~$60k) and learn from online courses or bootcamps?

 You talk it it just like any other person on telegram, and I'd like feedback on here if you choose to try it out. 
 It's made to be a more buddy/almost gf/average user. 
 Sometimes it does take a few sentences back and forth for your first few messages to help it grab context, but after that it'll be good to go.

 Tips for chatting are it doesn't think it's a bit, so talk normally, and if you're having issues and can't change the topic send /reset

I work at a very large bank with very old infrastructure. They are just beginning to try to use ai an ml models for credit risk, hence we are a very new team and there is a lot of work need to be done and a lot of data. I know they invested a lot of resources to build our team but I'm still a bit anxious. Let me know if you have any inputs. Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have been working as a data analyst (though the title is data scientist) since last 1 year. But during this time, my tasks are like a data analyst. I hardly wrote any code and built any model. My manager always insists me to learn domain (finance). I understand that having domain knowledge is good and needed but I feel like I am losing my interest in this field due to over emphasis on domain. Though i didn't work as a software developer but I like coding. I take initiative when there are some coding related tasks but when it comes to analysis i get anxiety. What should I do? Does Machine Learning engineer role suit me? I can learn n number of skills and not afraid to upskill myself. But don't want to become the domain guy. Please pour your suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I got to the final round for an ML eng position at a startup. Im wondering how I can prepare. Its over a week away so I have some time. 
 The thing is my background is statistics, and I passed their statistics/ML round that involved python data analysis with ML and also some math-theory questions about the models. I have no idea what is going to be asked though for the engineering part. I also don’t know this stuff as its not my background, though I am willing and want to learn it. 
 How can I at least show that to finally break into ML eng? Ive worked as a DS for a couple years but just doing data analysis got kind of boring and thats why i started looking at ML eng. I often don’t even get calls back for MLE so this is like the first time and I’ve made it to the final round. 
 Any resources for things I can review quickly in a week? What are engineering interviews like? They also mentioned there would be “a bit” of live coding, I am afraid that could mean leetcode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working full remote right now(programming/gamedev) and I travel several times a year for periods of up to two months. Because of specifics of my job I need to have a powerful workstation(I mostly need a powerful CPU) and I am comfortable with at least two 27" monitors. Traveling with that much stuff is only possible with a car, and even then the whole setup takes too much space.
Laptops are getting there with the compute power, but the 27" monitors aren't getting any smaller. Meta Quest Pro(which seems to be the top of the line now) has been just released and even tho it is somewhat pricey($1500), it still costs as much as three good 27" monitors.
Does anyone have any useful experience to share on working in a VR headset? Is it comfortable for longer periods of time? How is it on the eyes?

 from pandas import read_csv from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv('monthly-sunspots.txt').drop(['Month'],axis=1)#.head(100) data_a = data.to_numpy().T[0] data_a plt.figure(figsize=(20,10)) plt.plot(data_a) plt.rc("figure", figsize=(20,10)) plt.figure(figsize=(20,10)) plot_acf(data_a, lags=90) plt.show() 
 The example if taken from https://medium.com/@krzysztofdrelczuk/acf-autocorrelation-function-simple-explanation-with-python-example-492484c32711. The plot of data in the time is:

 If I want to produce a plot of autocorrelation as function of time instead of lags, how can I do ? Should I calculate the autocorrelation by using the Wiener–Khinchin theorem from which follows that the autocorrelation is the real part of the inverse Fourier transform of the power spectrum ? And thus the result of the inverse Fourier transform of the power spectrum is a signal that depends on time ? I am a bit confused.
 Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.

 Team X is where I'm working a data analyst position. Recently, two of the full-time analysts have left to different teams and I've been taking up some of their work. It's somewhat straightforward, but I'm having trouble juggling a lot of the industry jargon at all. Some tasks are more short-term, stressful, and up to the clock. There's not much coding at all.
 Team Y is where more of my interests lie as the tasks are more data science focused, long-term, and even though I still don't understand some of the information thrown around... it's definitely more applicable than in Team X and I enjoy what I do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, thinking about a job offer I just got and wanted the perspective of people who have been in the industry for way longer than I have. 
 For context: I am graduating in May 2023 with a Master’s in Stats from a top 25 university. I have internship experience but nothing super technical. 
 A couple days ago, I got my first job offer. I would be a Statistical Consultant with good pay, benefits, and guaranteed only 40 hours a week. While there’s a lot of things I like about the job, the company itself is something I’m worried about. I won’t name the company, but the company is known for selling a statistical software that is being pushed out by open source languages and has been reluctant to change their business model because of people who have been at the company for a very long time. My main concern is that it could be a mistake to work for this company so early in my career despite the great offer because of limited opportunity for personal growth.
 Am I overthinking this? Would love some advice. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, I came across this Reddit post. It intrigued me since I've never heard some of the suggested answers given. Such as KL-divergence. I've tried reading up about it from this article. 
 ​
 What I can understand is that KL-divergence is a way to compare 2 different distributions from one another? I don't quite understand it. It doesn't calculate the distance between the data points but rather measures the divergence of one probability distribution from another? (This part is a bit blurry to me) 
 So, let's say we're using a model, and we test it on 2 different samples. From there we are comparing how those 2 distributions are different with one another? Thus, what can we accomplish after this? I'm trying to wrap my head around this concept and see how beneficial it is. 
 On top of that, in the original reddit post, there are some that suggested using chi squared test/p-value. I'm guessing this is under the topic of hypothesis testing? If anyone has any good references for this topic and how to actually apply it in a data science scenario, that would be highly appreciated. 
 If there is any confusion in my writing, do let me know and I'll try to clarify it. Many thanks.
