        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I only have about a year of working experience as a data scientist so far and a relevant graduate degree and have been more open to opportunities in the US than I was in my previous field. Some colleagues always mention to me that I could always find some work in the US for DS since they are always looking for DS talent. People in the field I've talked to always mention that because I'm young and don't have a family to worry about, I should consider working abroad. I currently reside in Canada and have always wondered about the degree of difficulty it would be to get a job below the border as a Data scientist. Are companies in the US generally open to Canadian talent since getting a work visa is much easier than workers from other countries? Or are US companies who are in need of DS talent averse to foreign talent irrespective of their origin?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have inherited a project of maintaining and improving a large regression model. To sum it up, it's a neural net that's trained on huge amounts of historical data (millions of records with 1000+ data points) and with several regression outputs. It's not a time series model, although time (date) is one of the data points. The way it's structered, every week the data is updated with the most recent data and I transfer the weights from the latest model and continue training. However, I find it very difficult to evaluate this model if I want to introduce changes or additional data points because of the weights that are being transferred and the size of the model and the time it needs to train. Additionally, it's very resource intensive so it's difficult to train in parallel and see how the output is affected. All in all, any tips on how to make this process more friendly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy HN!
I find myself testing my ping from time to time, especially when my internet seems wonky while WFH. It feels like there should be an easier way test my ping than puling up a terminal or a complex web app - especially when I'm on my phone or any other device that doesn't have a terminal.
I figured I should be the change I wish to see in the world and created this super light ping test.
I also created a latency monitoring solution (https://github.com/cjjeakle/network-monitor), feel free to clone and try it out! I know there are a lot  more mature monitoring solutions out there, but I never did figure out how to set them up. This one is super simple: clone it to some device that's always on, compile it, set up some systemd stuff, and it's ready to rock on port 8180!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a little context, my academic background is a BS in math with a minor in Computer Science.
 I was having my weekly one on one with my thesis advisor for my master’s program (in industrial engineering) and he was telling me what courses I needed to take next semester in the event that I do wish to pursue a PhD (which is eventually what I plan on doing). He asked me if I wanted to go into teaching and I told him no but that I had thought about being an adjunct eventually, but that it was not my overall goal, and he said that my reasons for doing a PhD were more unclear if I didn’t want to teach. He’s constantly telling me that I have the ideal background for data science/operations research type positions in whatever industry because of my background and work experience (currently working as a data analyst and a research assistant), however, I’m only using these positions as a stepping stone. My actual overall end goal is to end up working in healthcare in a data science roll, and I’ve seen that typically at the entry level I meet the minimum requirements, but if I seek advancement for a lead researcher/lead data scientist position a PhD is really almost necessary.
 Aside from that I really enjoy learning and have thirst for being a pioneer/researcher in the field and with my undergrad I really didn’t feel like I delved enough into the topics I was interested in, which is partly why I wanted to pursue an advanced degree, but even now getting my masters and being halfway through I still feel like I still don’t delve enough into the material, which is another reason why I want to do my PhD.
 So, are my reasons that unclear? Or am I probably not conveying this information enough to my advisor?

The problem is, besides programming, math is required. I did not do it for 5 years now, but always liked it and been good at it. It would not be a problem I guess to learn it. My question is, how should I start? I need a roadmap. I want to start from the beginning. Any suggestions for books, courses, etc?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dall E 2 and it's image generation competitors like midjourney and stable diffusion really opened my eyes and made me feel like ai is coming faster then expected. 
 Maybe it's because I am more interested in the creative field but I havent heard much about ai in other fields... Having a program that can generate images just by describing them in any style I want is cool but it's not something I think anyone really needs and it will just take jobs away from artists in an already precarious industry with excessive supply.
 Now why isn't Ai creation being focused on making the stuff most of us human need but don't enjoy doing. That's what tools are for aren't they? 
 Why can't AI do a business plan, take care of taxes or manage finances, reply to boring work emails, write me a report, make a website, organize my calendar, diagnose me when I feel sick etc
 I feel like the creative fields are some of the last that need to be automated since alot of people enjoy the process of creation even more then the results and almost no one is crying out for AI to come and save art.
 In a utopia ai would be used to automate all the parts of work that we don't enjoy but are necessary so we could all focus on doing what we love.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little background at me: I am about to graduate with my degree in statistics within the next month. I am looking to start applying to entry level data science roles at the beginning of the new year. In my degree, I took a machine learning, data mining and deep learning class on top of my statistics coursework. 
 The issue I have is, during this coursework, most of our assignments consisted of smaller datasets in lower dimensions. I know in the real world I’ll have datasets that may consist of 100s to 1000s of predictors as well GBs to TBs of memory. Im not sure where I can find exposure to datasets as large to practice with. Also, I’m not sure what techniques I can use for proper feature selection. Im aware that to look through and remove any predictors that aren’t relevant to the problem. Also, we can remove any predictors that have 0 variance. After that, I’m a bit stumped on where to go. I know creating plots/ histograms of each predictor will be very time consuming. I know this is one of the most crucial steps in the process so I want to make sure I strengthen this skill. So I guess, in summary here are my questions:
  
Where can I find large datasets to practice? (I love kaggle for smaller datasets but it doesn’t seem to have many in large dimensions)
 
What are some techniques or skills I can use for feature selection? Are there any resources I can read to learn? Books/articles/papers/etc.
 
 Thanks in advance and I’m sorry if this has already been asked… I’m having trouble finding a post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This sad sequence of events just happened to a relative, and they're distraught. I haven't used Windows for ~15 years but since it was my area of expertise back then I still get lumbered with these problems. This one really surprised me though.
They logged into Windows 7 (I know, upgrade...) and it looked like their files were missing. In a panic, they opened Explorer and searched for their files. They turned up in the search. They just didn't show up in the usual "My Documents", "My Pictures", "My Videos" paths.
They decided to move the files "to the correct place". And then they shut the computer down.
The next time they started it, the same thing happened. This is where I got called in, because this time, the files didn't show up in a search. I told them to turn the computer off immediately and drop it with me.
Can you guess what happened? Well, check this out:
- Windows couldn't use their user profile because it was corrupted
- So it created a temporary profile in "C:\Users\TEMP". (This wasn't obvious to the user because Explorer hides the 'detail' of the file path and simply shows the username)
- Unwittingly, when they moved the precious files to the "correct" place, they were putting them into a temporary profile.
- On shutdown, Windows promptly deleted the temporary profile, so "C:\Users\TEMP" got wiped along with all of the files.
I was frankly astonished that Windows would drop them into a temporary user profile without dire warnings about its transience. Anyway, now I have to try to recover not only the files, but the directory structures. I'm not even sure it's possible... :(

Emotions are classified into categories of: fear, happy, sad, angry, excited, bored, and are automatically calculated (the output being a score of 0–100) on a daily basis by taking a random sampling of the most popular trending topics and tweets associated with them (by country).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI Implemented in Web Design
 With the rise of Artificial Intelligence in the last couple of years, AI writing and AI imagery have become quite common nowadays. Multiple companies and software like such have successfully integrated AI into their products because AI is definitely making work faster and sometimes even better than people in a lot of cases. So my question is, what is stopping companies from implementing AI in web design?
 Apologies if the question seems naive. I'm neither a design expert nor an AI expert. Just a student who was exploring these fields. 
 So I was wondering whether AI can boost their design industry in Web development. Can't AI be used to improve landing pages or even create them? If AI text writing, AI painting and AI illustrations software are all readily available, how hard will it be to implement the same concept for web designing?
 TIA for the insight!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So it looks like this sub has converged to a shared realisation that most DS jobs these days are just glorified BI Analyst roles. All these years I was super stressed that I was somehow incredibly unlucky in how I picked DS jobs, but now I can see that being a SQL monkey is actually the norm. Good.
 I can also understand the sentiment of those who are happy to stay in their boring but overpaid DS / BI jobs with 200k+ TC. But this is not why I made the switch into DS a few years ago - if anything, I was looking for a more exciting technical challenge after a couple of years in a pretty mundane SWE job.
 To those stuck in "BI" data science roles but keen to grow - what's your way of giving your brain cells some intellectual stimulation before your job makes you too dumb? Do you still manage to somehow dedicate, say, 20% of your time to something actually interesting? Or is it side projects? Or something else?
 Generally speaking, any pro tips to find joy in Data Science again after years of being a SQL monkey?

Basically Data Science doesn´t care why a model works as long as model predicts with a minimum of accuracy? Staticians do care why a model works and are interested in effect size, p values etc of variables in the model?
 I don´t understand why there is this distinction. If I have a better understanding of the impotance of variables in my model I will have more faith in the future predictability of my model. So explanation improves prediction in this sense. I think this is reasonable, because lots of statistics is about validating theoretical models and these models often want to predict the future.

 I'm lacking on initial knowledge of how to implement all those jupyter lines in a proper function...
 I hopped over to google and there I saw all modular non modular stuff, although it gave me theoretical knowledge, I'm still stuck on applying it practically...
 So if you guys have any head start over this topic like any book suggestions, any video recommendations, it would be really helpful...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All,
 I'm starting a masters in CS (OMSCS) this upcoming January with the goal of prepping myself for data science. I’m looking to bring my stats knowledge up to par to understand texts like Deep Learning- Goodfellow, PRML, ML A Probabilistic Perspective, etc. 
 My background is civil engineering and in undergrad took Calc 1-3, Diff Eq, Linear Algebra and a non-calc based stats 101 type class. When I got my masters in Civil-Transportation I took some stats modeling classes that covered regression (linear, logistic, poisson, negative binomial, etc) pretty heavily using R+NLOGIT.
 At this point my stats knowledge is pretty disjointed and feel like I dont have a solid understanding of the fundamentals. From what I can tell with some research the most popular recommendations I've seen are:
  
Statistical Inference- at first glance this book feels way above my level, like I can probably work out some things with effort, but I'll probably need another book to fill in the gaps.
 All of Statistics- Looks solid as a reference for someone who's taken way more stats than I have, super concise but super dry read.
 Mathematical Statistics with Applications(Wackerly)- This is one that feels like could be a possibility
 Introduction to Probability(Blitz)- This feels like the other contender
  
So far books 3 and 4 seem like best options, is there anything else I'm missing or votes one way or another?
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am an Analytics student and just started learning optimization this semester. 
 My program has all students work on FICO's Xpress Workbench, which uses Mosel as the programming language.
 I'd like to know if the tool / language is used much in practical workplace? If not I can just study as much as the course requires and focus on developing coding skills for other popular languages like Python. 
 Thanks,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I had previously set up my home server with SSH on a high port, and did the port forwarding thing on the firewall so that I can SSH into this system from elsewhere on the Internet.  It worked fine for months.
And then, it stopped working. The router didn’t have a software update as far as I can see. I re-checked everything, but I just can’t initiate a connection to the server from elsewhere on the Internet. It seems like it is filtered somewhere in the ISP’s network.  I can, and possibly will switch ISPs, but in the mean time, I’m looking at other technical options. Though we use the other main ISP for work, and their uptime in the last couple years has been… less than stellar.
One option is obviously rent a VPS, and set up a VPN or something, and have the home server connect to that at startup.  I can and have done that in the past, but even a low-cost VPS is $10 USD per month.
Some of the VPN providers out there have relatively low-cost multi-year deals, so I was looking at one of those. But it wasn’t clear if any of them supported what I wanted to do. I don’t really need to watch Netflix from a different region, I just want access to my server remotely.
I just wanted to see if anyone else is doing something like this.  Thanks!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys. I've been applying for entry-level data scientist / senior data analyst roles for a month now and the going has been tough. I'm trying to think if there are other careers I can expand into given what I know about data science so far, to enhance my ability to find a job. Obviously data engineering is an option, but also curious about peoples' thoughts about SWE in Data jobs and how hard it would be to make the transition, and what additional knowledge would be required to transition.
 Would be great to hear from people who have made a transition, in particular.
 For some context - I studied economics in undergrad and have 4 years of experience as a data analyst, and recently finished a 2-year masters in data science degree from a Top 10 American University. And I'm getting little hits in the market, even for job titles that I have already had (senior data analyst).
