        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am graduating in May 2023 with an MS in Business Analytics from a very high-ranking university but I have been unable to land an interview.
 Context:
 -I am an international student in the US who is switching from a network engineer after working for 3 years to hopefully a Data Analyst/ Business Analyst role
 My concerns:
 -Do the "objective" section and projects before the work-ex section look okay? Google said I need these for my career switch.
 -Are my projects impactful?
 -Should I add IBM and Google Data Analytics professional certificates on my resume?
 -What other technical skills can I learn and add?
 -Will my previous designation negatively impact my chances?
 Any advice on applying to jobs or resume are appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A friend of mine works for an educational non-profit with a mission to provide kids extra education outside their classrooms. She asked me for advice on a project she has but I'm stumped too.
 The company provides both digital and physical exercise pages or articles for kids. They launched a new solution last year that assigns this educational content to kids and allows them to either: a) print it out and complete it or b) complete it virtually on a digital dashboard.
 ​
 My friend's goal: Highlight utilization of the assigned content in a data dashboard to show that "Hey!! The stuff we give kids actually gets used!"
 My friend's scenario: While she can track digital content to assess if it has been viewed and completed, they don't have a way to track printed content. She can see if something is printed but obviously doesn't know if the printout was thrown away or even completed. 
 My friend's dilemma: What is the best way to show overall utilization? I recommended that she counts printed content as being "done" but she told me that was not enough. I then recommended that she separate digital from printed content and hone in on digital. She was more on board with this idea but the only caveat is that a majority of their content gets printed.
 ​
 We're both new to the data field, so are there any approaches or questions we may be missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 3 years ago, I graduated from a well renowned french school (ENSAE Paris) as a data scientist.
 To be honest, I managed to graduate thanks to good math grades but neglected anything that was applied.
 I didn't want to work in a company and I liked maths, so I became a maths professor (I don't have a PhD but still teach at the grad level, things are different here from what you might be used to).
 Ironically though, I'm teaching numerical analysis using Python.
 I only have 8 hours of teaching and a lot of free time on my hands and I was considering working as a freelance datascientist, using my degree and my experience as a maths professor to my advantage.
 Any insight is welcome. I will need an online data science course though and I want your suggestions on that one :).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I’m a mathematics major in my last year for my bachelor’s and I’m interested in going into data analytics/ data science for my career. I’m debating whether or not to add an applied stats minor to my curriculum, which evens out to four classes a quarter till graduation. The necessary classes will be on sampling surveys and biostatistics. The drawback is that this will really take a toll on me since I do 3 hour round trip commutes to get to school and I work part-time as well. I’d like to know if I can learn these applied skills on my own time via projects and certifications but I feel having an applied stats minor may look better on a resume. But I’d like to leave it up to the more knowledgeable people in this sub: is it worth the perseverance to get the minor or should I devote any extra time I have to polishing my skills in programming and projects? Thanks, all.

        <id>https://lobste.rs/s/1eryiz</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/javierhonduco/rbperf"/>
        <updated>2022-10-30T20:02:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[rbperf is a Ruby profiler I’ve been working on that aims to incur low overhead, can be run against processes without having to modify or restart them and produces on-CPU profiles rather than accounting for “wall” time.
It also has some basic tracing functionality that I am planning to extend. One of the features I want to add before the end of the year is allocation tracing. It can now trace system calls, so we can see exactly which Ruby code called a particular system call!
The BPF stack walker is written in C and compiled to BPF bytecode using clang, and the userspace bits are written in Rust, which has been a pleasure to use so far and I believe it’s a good fit for this project. It’s been my first “real” project in this language which has been a great learning experience.
I’m planning to write some posts on how rbperf works, why it’s been designed this way, and the many learnings along the way thus far :)
Would love to hear any feedback or ideas. I am still quite new to Rust, and I am sure that things can be improved a lot! Thanks!!

 I can't really think of any arguments for using this technology other than that it could be a good tool to prevent crimes before they occur. And the only argument I have against using it is that it could give racist/discriminating results. Anyone who could give me some help with more arguments?

 Wan't to move into data science, happy to take a data analyst job if this would help gain experience (from what I've seen Analyst roles in the UK require less experience/education than in data science). 
 Is it worth me doing a bootcamp or just doing self teaching of required skills? i.e. does a bootcamp actually improve my job prospects?

Data science and machine learning are pretty new domains in my country it is studied theoretically at universities and basically non existant in companies. Our supervisor gave us a subject of study , and told us to start doing research .He avoids our questions when asked about data availability. I know from the experience of other students that companies are reluctent to give data to interns. But without data there's no end of studies' project and no degree.
 What can i tell them to convince them that i'm not a data thief? I know that data can be modified, and protected but i really don't know what to tell them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 ​
 I'm looking for some advice. I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Physics. However, after a shift of interest, I will be dropping my physics major. I decided to study data science for a year abroad and realized that data science is a career path I want to pursue. I studied introductions to machine learning, data mining, regression, data structures... all using R. Prior to my change in interest, my goal was to pursue a PhD in physics at a top university but now I want to pursue a PhD in data science. I currently am a 6th year student graduating next semester. I currently have a plethora of mathematics and physics courses underneath my belt. I also happen to have co-authored a physics paper in Materials Science and have a decent amount of research experience. My particular areas of research interests (physics and financial engineering) just so happens to be offered at Ivy league schools. In my opinion, I think it is a bit impractical to assume I have a fighting chance at getting offered a PhD position at these universities (Cornell, Columbia, Yale, Stanford, etc...). I do not have a ton of experience in Data Science. Would it be more practical to pursue a masters and obtain more work / research experience before considering a PhD position? I guess an alternative question is: how would I be able to make myself sufficiently competitive to pursue a good Data Science masters / PhD? There are tons of Data Science graduate programs and I'm having some trouble finding applicable ones for me considering graduate application deadlines are around the corner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, We’re building an open-source identity and risk management platform and we’ve just released the first chunk of code, a fully customizable KYC flow & UI, to the public.
We’ve chosen to use Svelte so our flows would be lightweight (it is ~50kb gzipped).
Next up:
- Adding forms and components for it to be used as a full onboarding flow.
- Releasing an open-source case management dashboard, for manual approval of users.
- Releasing an open-source rule engine, to help automate decisions.
We’d love to hear your feedback, suggestions, or any question you’ve got.
And if the rest of the project is relevant or interesting to you, follow us and, we’ll update you once new things are available.
Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using a character based CNN for categorizing data strings. Inside those strings are sub-segments that I want to categorize, or recognize. I see it like the 2d object recognition in RCNN or SDD. They put bounding boxes around multiple objects in an image. That’s what I want, underline/tag substrings and identify their categories. I also think my problem is analogous to 1d data like ECG data with the pqrst parts of the heart beat. Many of the ECG algorithms talk about identifying the unusual heartbeat but I haven’t found examples of putting boxes around the sub segment parts of the heartbeat (pqrst parts). 
 Anyone have any tips or direction to suggest on how I can change my conv1d CNN into a conv1d RCNN or SDD. I have implemented in PyTorch but I can change to other libraries if needed.

I would wager its an ensemble of deep learning (too much data to not make use of it) and non machine learning techniques with many moving parts and pieces. But that's just about all I could find. 
 Most of the discussion and search results are geared towards youtube creators who wants to game the algorithm to get more views, and not towards someone who wants to understand the algorithms technical features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a bunch of matrices of the hyperparameters of my ML model, and I want to make conclusions about what values/shapes of hyperparameters perform the best for different types of inputs, so essentially I want to cluster different hyperparameter matrices together to make statements about what kind of things I should be using when.
 My question is, how can I actually cluster matrices? Is there a "best practice" way that already exists?
 If it were datapoints with some kind of x and y, I could just plot them and then run k-means or whatever I want. But for matrices, how can I get a "2D" feature space? I don't know very much about running k-means or clustering in very high dimensions, but my current thoughts are that I could try and take the Frobenius norm, or the L0/1/2/3/4/etc norm of my matrices. However, just taking the norm only gives me 1 "axis" so I don't know how I'd plot / cluster that (I suppose you could cluster on just 1 axis...). 
 My other main concern is that in taking the norm of the matrix, I lose a lot of information. It isn't clear to me that the norm of the matrix really captures anything/enough about the actual values of the hyperparameters, but rather only looks at their variance or generally their fuzzy shape.
 Does anyone know how to cluster matrices and have any advice for how to proceed?

 I read some posts about portfolios in this sub, and i realized that for the past year, people are being more helpful, saying that you should have a portfolio, specially if you're looking for an entry level job in DS.
 But like 2-3 years ago, people just answered "dont bother, no one looks at that shit"
 So, question is, do recruiters look at my portfolio if its a entry level job? Because i really feel i learned doing the projects, its not the Titanic bs haha. But if they don't care, how am i suposed do get the job?

 I am myself very fresh in the field, coming straight from a physics degree in university, so I don't really now a lot about data science yet, but the rest of the team are mostly experienced data scientists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Workarounds to computer access in healthcare are sufficiently common that they often go unnoticed. Clinicians focus on patient care, not cybersecurity. We argue and demonstrate that understanding workarounds to healthcare workers’ computer access requires not only analyses of computer rules, but also interviews and observations with clinicians. In addition, we illustrate the value of shadowing clinicians and conducing focus groups to understand their motivations and tradeoffs for circumvention. Ethnographic investigation of the medical workplace emerges as a critical method of research because in the inevitable conflict between even well-intended people versus the machines, it’s the people who are the more creative, flexible, and motivated. We conducted interviews and observations with hundreds of medical workers and with 19 cybersecurity experts, CIOs, CMIOs, CTO, and IT workers to obtain their perceptions of computer security. We also shadowed clinicians as they worked. We present dozens of ways workers ingeniously circumvent security rules. The clinicians we studied were not “black hat” hackers, but just professionals seeking to accomplish their work despite the security technologies and regulations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't have a background in data science or maths but am interested in developing skills needed to take my dasic data pulls & visualisation to the next level (Google Data studio with csv/sheets Integration). To get motivation in learning either sql, or python (I'm a Noob, have no idea where to start) I thought about the following project which covers enough areas/depencies to actually give me very desirable transferable skills for my non-tech job. Here's my hobby project idea to motivate learning while using real data and problem resolution. I'd love to get your thoughts on where to start/what to learn. 
 The "problem": the gas stations near my house change prices multiple times a day and I'd love to learn which time of the day and day of the week it's usually cheaper to refuel
 Project V1: learn how to pull data from a public api that contains all info for gas daily gas prices in my district; clean up historical data & visualise price points over time in Google data studio; find a way to automate data pulls once per day which will update this dashboard; add a column for linear forecast
 Project V2: research which real world factors influence fuel prices the most (i.e crude oil prices, seasonality, weather) ; pull historical data for these two events; do the same for these as project 1; explore polynomial forecasting; generate a prediction for fuel prices based on latest crude oil cost & weather forecast
 Skills I wish to learn with such a project - How APIs work and using them for data science - Practice Data modeling for visualisation - Forecasting - Learn basic SQL or Python, Pandas (clueless, this is all new to me) - Dashboarding for Digital Marketing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I’m starting my second year studying data science, I’m trying to pick a topic for my masters thesis. I’m new to the research field, my bachelors wasn’t really focused on research, the education system in the country I studied at was exam-focused. So now I’m interested in recommender systems and after some research I decided to work on the cold start problem. I’m interested in your opinions regarding this topic. Do you think it’s a promising domain? Could I get some findings that would be useful for the research community or is it a dead end domain? Should I maybe find a more specific problem and work on that? Another question is, would this topic also be useful in finding a job later on? Please excuse the questions if they seem stupid but I’m a beginner here and looking for opinions and maybe inspiration. Thank you.

 I am in the initial stages of developing a time series forecasting model that could potentially predict future users for the next 6 to 12 months.
 I am looking for some pointers on how to select the appropriate methodology for active users forecasting.
 Any pointers would help a great deal. Thank you.
