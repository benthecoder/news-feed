 Now you got the chance. I started to work on my Sci-Fi novel using Artificial Intelligence. Together, we wrote an exciting book and made fantastic illustrations for it.
 It's called Beyond The Horizon, it takes place in the year 2120. The main character, Jenna, a young astronaut is sent on a mission to explore a new planet.
 Here is the link for the first chapter (pdf version): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eaY3EOVW4LucsEfcNvugknxbkti9xaqD/view?usp=share_link
 Let me know what you think!
 Thanks,
 Tom

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently started working on a time series prediction and forecasting task, and the dataset that I use contains close to 700 features and only 4 years worth of monthly data points (just 48 samples). Part of my preprocessing workflow will obviously be to remove the multicollinearity. As a first starting point, I considered using the VIF before going onto other methods. After the first tests, I quickly realized that almost all of the features are flagged as highly correlated. I went on to further test this hypothesis by running correlation tests on individual features that got the highest VIF values, and found out that they were not linearly correlated to more than a couple of features.
 This outcome led me to the question of whether VIF is dependent on sample size, and if the results would be different with a much larger sample size. I couldn't find any evidence to support this and the next obvious step is to test this hypothesis by recursively reducing a large enough dataset. Before I do so though, does anyone have any experience with such an effect?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not newspapers or media services (though those can be annoying too), but products in general? It feels like it's getting harder and harder to just buy something in the tech world, especially when it comes to running programs on my home computer. Want a password manager? It's a SaaS now. Note taking app? SaaS. Image editor or office suite? SaaS (thanks Adobe...)
This is especially annoying given I generally refuse to rent anything in life, and will go out of my way to buy something upfront simply so there's no risk of losing it if finances get worse in future (or the wrong billionaire buys the company). Yet it seems like it's getting harder to do so, especially when open source products don't exist for that domain.
So yeah, why is that? And is anyone else tired of the constant barrage of subscriptions for things that should be one off purchases?

 I grew up watching the tom sawyer movie in my native language. When searching for it I could not buy it in my native language and could only download it from an old forum. I decided to buy the DVD in English (I shared it for free btw https://archive.org/details/a-storybook-classic-tom-sawyer-2005) and then maybe put my native's language lines over it. the problem is, it's kinda dirty from artifacts. Is there any way to clean it using AI?
 thanks in advance :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to self-teach SQL and I'm planning on picking some data set, figuring out how to store it in a database, and then playing around with it a bit before deciding on some sort of analysis to do or maybe ML algorithm to apply (I figure I may as well get some practice in other DS topics while trying to learn SQL, since SQL is just a tool afterall). I figure I'll need to use Python or R if I want to apply an ML algorithm without implementing the whole thing from scratch, but I'll at least need to do some exploratory data analysis first to figure what features of the data look interesting, what algorithm might be appropriate, etc. 
 But how do I decide how much to do with SQL and how much to do with Python/R? I've posted about learning SQL a few times this past week and I've gotten several responses saying essentially that SQL is nothing more than reading in data from a database and doing simple manipulations on it, like select and merge, but also several other responses saying to be sure I learn more SQL than that if I want to actually have useful skills. Obviously context is key and I figure there are some people who only use SQL for the basics and others who use it for mich more advanced stuff. 
 I guess what I'm asking is, how do I know when SQL is the appropriate tool for the job? Like, is it a good tool to use for exploratory analysis, such as computing descriptive statistics and creating summary tables of variables? Or is mostly used to extract/group/etc subsets of data? Or, to put it another way, should I use SQL just for the same types of operations I'd use R's dplyr library for, when working on a small dataset read in from an Excel file, then switch to R or Python? Or would it be reasonable to also use it for EDA?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a place to find portfolio examples? How do people usually attach a portfolio to a resume? What do these portfolios look like? How are they optimized? 
 I'm about to start my final year of a Bachelors in Data Science and want to start trying to find a full / part-time (not just seasonal) internship/job. I have seen a handful of the hiring managers in this sub say they do check the portfolios, and sometimes they do more damage than good. I was hoping to find some examples of great portfolios to compare to mine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[question is a bit confusing, but let me explain. I study data science at university, but it seems to be a lot more data analysis than actual data science (for now, at least) but I still want to end up in the field of data science and have an internship under my belt before I graduate (I'm a junior rn). So what are some concepts I should know, and how well should I know them?
 For example, within machine learning (or other concepts), which models should I know and how well should I know them?
 Let me know if I'm still confusing lol.. and any other advice is much appreciated ! - sincerely, a struggling college student.

 I am writing to ask for help Christmas shopping! : ) 
 My brother has a masters in ML and works at an AI company. He is working on a long-term project, and he explained to me that he is approaching the project through a game theory lens, while other AI teams working on the same project have taken a nat'l language processing-focused approach. The project involves solving a complex board game for real-life applications. I am looking for books that would offer him interesting/useful information about game theory in ML context. I am also open to any other AI/ML/comp sci book recs. He reads textbooks about chemistry and comp sci for pleasure, so this would NOT be a "super lame" gift for him. 
 ​
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I'm currently finishing my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and I just completed my minor in data science (i.e. I finished the last course required to satisfy the minor's requirements). I found I like the data science stuff significantly more than EE, but I'm too far along to even consider switching majors at this point. Hence, I'm trying to self-teach additional data science skills and I know being to use SQL and work with databases (something none of my DS courses covered unfortunately) in particular is a vital skill to have if I have any hope of getting a job in DS. 
 I posted previously about this and I got a ton of responses with people recommending so many different learning platforms and several different API's and DBMS's that I'm a little unsure where to start. I started just reading about what databases even are so I can have a clear mental model in my head, but now I'm struggling to decide how to actually get started with SQL itself. 
 The easiest thing (and hence what I'm tempted to do) would probably be to use one of the Python API's people recommended, just because I already have some experience using Python for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis, and I have Python fully set-up on my system already (and getting everything set up to use any new programming language is typically a pain). But is that a good idea, seeing as this will be the first time I've used SQL? Will it it hurt me later on if I get used to just using Python to call SQL rather than learning how to use it directly? Like, would prospective employers be less likely to higher me if I only have experience using SQL via Python, or will there be things I can't do through the API? Or am I just completely overthinking this and it doesn't really matter whether I use SQL directly or indirectly?
