        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If doing an AB test and tracking something like “avg number of purchases per user” or “avg revenue per user”, etc., should you always time-gate/ limit the amount of observation time you are looking at for each user? 
 For example, if I have users enrolling for 7 days, I will only include data from their first 14 days of enrolment. This would result in each user only having 14 days of valid data regardless of which day they enrolled on. 
 Alternatively, non-time-gating would just be using all the data available. Some users will have more days of data available than others because they enrolled sooner. 
 I tend to always time-gate, but I’m wondering if the opposite is useful? The assumption is that we are randomizing on the user level and not something like page-views.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After coming back from my home country where the insecurity is a big part of the daily life (armed robbery, kidnapping, murder), I started thinking of what would happen if something happened to me and how would I be able to ease the burden on my love ones to manage my digital assets (cancel subscriptions, keep my digital libraries, etc). So I ask: do you have a procedure in place to grant or transfer access in case of death?
My first idea would be using a password manager for everything, list every device used for 2SA and confine within my will a master password.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, had some q's related to bayesian inference and using it for generic business ab testing (ex: what version of an ad has a higher click rate, what type of sales page produces more revenue, etc.).
 I have some experience using beta and binomial distributions for this type of task when the metric of interest is a conversion rate, but I generally don't see a lot of examples where the metric of interest isn't a rate online.
 My questions would be:
  
Does anyone have any good resources (preferably in R) of using Bayesian inference in an ab testing framework that isn't solely focused on using beta and binomial distributions? I want to be more prepared for metrics that aren't conversion rates. Could be blog posts or books, but ideally would be showing examples that were focused on experimentation / ab testing
 
Is a language like stan overkill for bayesian ab testing? Doing a bit of research, it seems a bit unnecessary for creating a posterior off a beta prior and binomial likelihood, but not sure about other use cases. I guess this answer might be it depends, but worth asking

 Wanted to ask for directions and advice on how to run MySQL in the docker.
 Created a python script and app using it. Everything is just fine, but need to save the output in the DataBase and the company I work for uses MySQL. Can anyone help me set it up or show me where I can learn how?

 Kind regards,
 your friendly engineer who's trying to learn DS.

 Anyone happen to know any good metric?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I'd like to introduce a semantic segmentation model named RTFormer. 
 This might be some help to you. Hope you enjoy it.
 ​
 This paper propose RTFormer, an efficient dual-resolution transformer for real-time semantic segmenation, which achieves better trade-off between performance and efficiency than CNN-based models.
 To achieve high inference efficiency on GPU-like devices, RTFormer leverages GPU-Friendly Attention with linear complexity and discards the multi-head mechanism. Besides, cross-resolution attention is more efficient to gather global context information for high-resolution branch by spreading the high level knowledge learned from low-resolution branch.
 Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RTFormer, it achieves state-of-the-art on Cityscapes, CamVid and COCOStuff, and shows promising results on ADE20K.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think a lot of the debate on the ethics and legal status of image generation models hinges on the question of how similar their outputs are to their training data. I have not seen very much debate on this topic; the response from most AI people is to roll their eyes, while artists don't have the expertise to back up their claims of plagiarism. But, when I looked, I found at least one example of craiyon nearly exactly reproducing one of its training images.
 Here are three questions that I'm curious about, and that I would love to see rigorous research on:
 For a given output image, can the most similar training images be recovered?
 On average, how many unique images do the models draw from to create their output? (if this can be measured)
 How does each model respond when its prompt appears verbatim in its training set?
 Thanks to anyone who can help inform me about these issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm currently in an analytics role and trying to dive into more sophisticated ways of looking at our company's data. One of the ways I was exploring was applying clustering (such as k-means) to time-series data. The only issue is that my object is to find "users" and "devices" that are anomalous based on hourly traffic. I also have other columns such as "geo" as well as some proprietary labels (but the main two are user device combinations)
 My issue is that anytime i attempt to run a clustering algo in Python, the algo just clusters data into it's hourly buckets and I'm not really able to find anything insightful. I spoke to a data scientist who suggested I do the following:
  
scale the data down using a scaling method such as min-max scaler(some users/devices will have much more traffic than others)
 Use time pattern as a feature
  
I don't understand how to do this.
 For example, this is a dummy version of how my table looks like:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/oq81i0ube2x91.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=69215e678310c61904386207593df11ad0b797be
 I think what I'm trying to figure out is how to take that data and turn it into a feature:
 {
 "user / device" : a / roku,
 "timeOfHour" : 1
 "traffic" : 100
 ... and so forth
 }
 I'm just stuck and not sure the best place. I also tried reading up on papers but my problem seems fairly unique and I can't seem to find a reference point. Does this seem like the right approach?
 Lastly, when running scalers, am I supposed to run the scaler against ALL of the data? For example, when I applied the robust scaler in sklearn to my data, the end result looked the same when i plotted my charts. My goal is to bring all of the smaller user/device combinations that may have a fraction of the traffic as the top user/devices on the same scale and I'm not sure how to do this. 
 Any help/tips would be greatly appreciate and I apologize if the above sounds a bit messy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[rbperf is a Ruby profiler I’ve been working on that aims to incur low overhead, can be run against processes without having to modify or restart them and produces on-CPU profiles rather than accounting for “wall” time.
It also has some basic tracing functionality that I am planning to extend. One of the features I want to add before the end of the year is allocation tracing. It can now trace system calls, so we can see exactly which Ruby code called a particular system call!
The BPF stack walker is written in C and compiled to BPF bytecode using clang, and the userspace bits are written in Rust, which has been a pleasure to use so far and I believe it’s a good fit for this project. It’s been my first “real” project in this language which has been a great learning experience.
I’m planning to write some posts on how rbperf works, why it’s been designed this way, and the many learnings along the way thus far :)
Would love to hear any feedback or ideas. I am still quite new to Rust, and I am sure that things can be improved a lot! Thanks!!
