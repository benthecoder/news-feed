 Over the past few weeks, I have been gathering a list of AI tools and organizing them. Some of these tools may not have a lot of information, so I hope that this list will make it easier for you to research and choose the best one for you. I will continue to add more details and regularly update the list. You are welcome to contribute to the list as well. You can contribute without registering an account and I will review and approve the submissions.
 Here is the list : https://favird.com/l/ai-tools-and-applications

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The answer to this quesiton might be rather simple but I lack the experience to know.
 In it's most general form, this question is about the most compact data format to store a table of values with lot's of repeated values, e.g. for n columns:
  
 idx 1 2 3 4 ... n 
  
 idx1 1v1 2v1 3v1 4v1 ... nv1 
  idx2 1v1 2v2 3v1 4v1 ... nv1 
  idx3 1v2 2v2 3v1 4v2 ... nv1 
  idx4 1v2 2v3 3v1 4v2 ... nv2 
  idx5 1v2 2v3 3v2 4v2 ... nv2 
  idx6 1v3 2v3 3v2 4v2 ... nv2 
 
 I emphasise where the values change from those in previous rows. The format of the example values here is simply that 'nvm' means the mth value ('v') of column n.
 Specifically, my application is a set of n quantities that are updating over time independently of each other, and I want to store the whole history of all quantities, the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m doing regression on a dataset with 1000 features, mapping to a single output value.
 NNs are consistently 2x more accurate on validation and test sets, not overfitting.
 This aggravated my team who spent a long time making these features suitable for linear regression, and now NNs just come in and do better.
 So I’m tasked with explaining WHY NNs do better. 
 I guess it’s because there are nonlinear relationships between the features and the output, but what’s the best way to show this when you have 1000+ features?
 Some thoughts:
  
R2 values. Mine are good for linear regression (>0.98) so that’s not it.
 
PCA? Idk
 
 Any other ways to show that there are nonlinear relationships in your data?

 I started last semester in Austria at the University of Vienna - Computer Science specialization Data Science, but it is in my opinion too much research oriented and I don't really like the university.
 I'm considering to change to a different city or country (in Europe), if you have any experience with any other university and can tell me more how is the education there and overall student life please leave a comment!
 What I am searching for:
 + uni that has curriculum focused on doing projects/programming or at least some focus on the industry
 + uni which is open for international students (sorry uni vienna but in my opinion as a person who can't communicate in German it can be hard and a lot of the times I felt excluded as an international)
 + low or zero tuition fee (so except for example UK)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently a masters student studying business administration with a specialization in business analytics. I really want to work in some kind of analytics field, but frankly I have no professional experience. I’ve held plenty of odd jobs but the jobs I feel are important enough to include in my resume and applications are an administrative assistant at a hospital, an athletics marketing intern at a SEC school and a athletics marketing graduate assistant at a low level D1 school. That last job is my current job, and truthfully, I handle a lot of responsibility, I might as well be a full time staff member with the title of Marketing Assistant or potentially even Associate. However, given the title I’m stuck with of “graduate assistant” I don’t think people are considering this professional experience. Not to mention, I have zero work experience in DA but I do have a project portfolio with 3 projects using Python, SQL and Power BI. I’m applying to data analyst roles, sports analyst (because of my experience) and business analyst. 
 Ultimately, my question here is, am I wasting my time trying to get a job in analytics? It doesn’t even seem like these “Jr. Data Analyst” roles are considering me, because according to LinkedIn, over half the people applying to these jobs are “Senior Level Applicants”. Is my time better spent finding some generic management or project management role and then getting into analytics once I have some legitimate professional experience?

In terms of highest total comp, work life balance, huge datasets to be able to work with, having infrastructure set up for you to put models into production, least barrier to entry (either requiring a lot of domain knowledge or like a phd for quant jobs), and ease of pivoting to other industries. Ultimately I want to figure out if I should aim to work at a mid sized healthcare? Small Startup? High growth adtech company? Etc.

 I'm specifically interested in programs that are totally online, but I find myself having some difficulty determining which programs are worth the money. 
 Here are the factors I'm considering:
  
How rigorous is the program?
 How effectively do they use online learning tools to enhance student engagement?
 How quickly can the program be completed?
 How much does the program cost?
 How effective is their job placement/career services office?
  
I'm especially interested in hearing first hand accounts from current students, alumni or faculty.
 Is anyone willing to chime in with their experience? I would find it immensely helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 I have been sticking to the one-page resume but I got nowhere with it. Recently, I came across a Software Engineering Manager (SWEM) at Google, Ex SWEM at Amazon, Booking, and he claimed that he received offers at all MAANG. So this guy is promoting the idea of listing all the relevant experiences in detail and definitely going for many pages.
 He mentioned that one page won't probably make you pass ATS, and no one will get any useful information from two sentences for each experience, so it kinda makes sense. 
 To give more context, I am a second-year data science master's student. I have three working experiences. Did a handful of strong side projects. I don't consider myself mid-level yet. 
 So what do you think about that? Should I still stick to one page, eliminating many details? Or list all relevant experiences and go for many pages? 
 Highly appreciate your discussion and suggestions!

Is it worth learning frameworks like flask and data warehousing? I have decent freedom during my job to experiment with new tech. I was thinking perhaps a quick move towards either DE, MLE, MLOps and then eventually SWE once the programming is there. I know python quite well but am no expert.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I'm a Statistics/Finance Master's student on the job hunt. I have previously done 2 internships in data science, and have a job offer for a junior data scientist role in London.
 I was wondering what are the usual exit paths for data scientist. While I enjoy the job right now as it's great way to upskill technically and explore interesting data , I'm not sure if I see myself in the industry for the next 10 years. I feel the pay atleast in the UK is dog shit compared to work you do. 
 Anyone transitioned to other roles what path did you take? I have to think about applying to different sectors if the exit opportunities are narrow.People in the industry for a long time does the work get dry?
 Any advice is appreciated.
 Cheers!

 X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features) Training data.
 I assume the curly braces around "array-like" implies one-or-more array-like objects but I would like to have a better understanding of the syntax used here. Is this part of the notation of context-free grammar?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract: We present a novel parsing algorithm for all context-free languages. The algorithm features a clean mathematical formulation: parsing is expressed as a series of standard operations on regular languages and relations. Parsing complexity w.r.t. input length matches the state of the art: it is worst-case cubic, quadratic for unambiguous grammars, and linear for LR-regular grammars. What distinguishes our approach is that parsing can be implemented using only immutable, acyclic data structures. We also propose a parsing optimization technique called context-free memoization. It allows handling an overwhelming majority of input symbols using a simple stack and a lookup table, similarly to the operation of a deterministic LR(1) parser. This allows our proof-of-concept implementation to outperform the best current implementations of common generalized parsing algorithms (Earley, GLR, and GLL). Tested on a large Java source corpus, parsing is 3–5 times faster, while recognition—35 times faster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys! I have a few questions and didn't find suitable answers online. 
 I'm trying to think of a case where transforming the data like log, minmaxscaler, standarization, using quantiles or whatever you want has a benefit on the performance of the model.
 Can someone guide me in this matter? Maybe an article or something interesting to read. I have tried on some problems and didn't change anything, it mostly seems unnecessary steps.
 Thanks!
