Like, literally, I'm higher up than everyone because That's how Science Mountain works. You only know this if you have the right kind of academial credentialification. These are facts.
 You think Science is your ally? You merely adopted The Science. I was born in it, molded by it. That's my quote, I made that up. Everyone is incompetent but me. I'm not even bragging, it's True. I know because I log everything I do, and Being Awesome occupies the largest percentiality of my time, other than Elden Ring, which I'm also amazing at. The reality is that this sentence is in bold text.
 Don't ask me for advice. I'm too smart. Don't challenge my Claims, my Philosophizing is beyond reproach.
 All you 'Data Science Daffodils' should not be here. That's just my opinion.
 I'll see you scrubs in the comments, unless I decide to quit Reddit first.
 Powerful final sentence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, working on a research project right now doing a binary classification on text data. Essentially, I have a ton of text data that I'm looking over and labeling each datapoint (composed of text + a couple of other less useful features) as "yes" or "no" if the text looks like it fits a condition (I apologize for the vagueness). The unfortunate part is that I'm only hitting "yes" a very low % of the time, which is completely expected, but it's resulted in me only having ~100 positive examples. Ideally, I'd have wayyy more. So this brings me to my question, what methods exist to find positive examples more efficiently while limiting how much bias is going into the process?
 I have a couple of thoughts. I was considering doing an unsupervised clustering, maybe K-means, and see if my positive samples fit snuggly into a cluster, and look at the other examples in that cluster. This might work but seems a little inefficient. 
 I've also considered building a classifier based on the positive samples I have right now, which might get me something, but I worry a lot about overfitting, perhaps there is a classification technique you could recommend to me in this case that works well with small amounts of data? I've considered simple models like logistic regression, but bayesian methods have also caught my eye. I'm also considering using some sort of tree-based method and increasing the depth of the tree incrementally until I start to see something that I want.
 Lastly, I've tried to use some domain knowledge to generate a candidate list of samples. Basically, I've looked at the positive examples so far and applied what I know to be (somewhat) true about this particular problem to limit the samples a bit more with keyword matching. None of these have been quite as successful as I'd like, so I'd like to consult your wisdom and see if you have any advice for me :) Thank you for your help.

I want to know if it is really necessary, because I will have to train this part a lot.
 I can be good at coming up with ideas and delivering them, but is good communication necessary? (here we call it "sales talk").

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Newer to DS work and am looking for some direction on approaches. 
 I'm trying to estimate the impact of an event upon a customer satisfaction metric, for both the general population and specific segments. The event is assumed to have heterogeneous effects due to the nature of the customer base (impacted customers in some regions more than others) and was not part of an experimental study.
 I've tried: Using Arima time series modeling based upon the metric, fitting on the time period prior to the event, predicting after the event, and comparing the predicted values to the actual ones. However, Arima doesn't appear to be appropriate due to limited data. There appears to be monthly seasonality, as well as seasonality related to the day of the week. 
 Since the customer satisfaction metric is an aggregation from scores provided by individuals, I've also tried using individual scores pre-event as training and using individual scores given post-event as test, fitting traditional classification models to the training set and making predictions on the test set. To estimate the difference between the expected versus actual customer metric, I've taken the training scores and predicted test scores and calculated the aggregated metric for those records as the expected aggregate value and separately calculated the aggregated metric over the training scores and actual test values for the actual aggregate value. However, this method gives me a larger than actual estimated impact - regardless of whether or not I balance the classes during training, this modeling approach tends to predict one customer rating more frequently than the others.
 I've also done some reading into causality libraries/modeling approaches, like econml DML, but I'm not sure how helpful CATE would be here, since my metric of interest is an aggregation. Any suggestions?

 I’ve found some classes on edx by Harvard and an online tutorial website called data camp that will supposedly allow me to learn the needed skills. 
 Are these viable ways to earn certification, build a portfolio and start a career?

 I'm a junior in an undergrad BS Data Science program at a small Christian university in the Midwest. I've been searching for a summer internship in Data Science/Data Analytics since September and have had no luck. I've reached out to people in my network and those of my family and professors wherever possible, and I've visited my university's career center several times for resume revisions and have adopted the various strategies they have suggested. I've submitted somewhere in the ballpark of 200 applications in the last 6 months, and I've been ghosted by most recruiters. Of the 200 applications, I received 4 callbacks for interviews, and of those 4, only 1 resulted in a follow-up interview. For this last position, I was well-prepared and felt that I performed well in both inter…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present an interactive design system that allows non-expert users to create animated mechanical characters. Given an articulated character as input, the user iteratively creates an animation by sketching motion curves indicating how different parts of the character should move. For each motion curve, our framework creates an optimized mechanism that reproduces it as closely as possible. The resulting mechanisms are attached to the character and then connected to each other using gear trains, which are created in a semi-automated fashion. The mechanical assemblies generated with our system can be driven with a single input driver, such as a hand-operated crank or an electric motor, and they can be fabricated using rapid prototyping devices. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by designing a wide range of mechanical characters, several of which we manufactured using 3D printing. While our pipeline is designed for characters driven by planar mechanisms, significant parts of it extend directly to non-planar mechanisms, allowing us to create characters with compelling 3D motions.

We periodically need to collect data from teams via drop downs and free fields and Excel is proving difficult to manage (people keep deleting things, changing formulas, etc).

 Ideally this tool would save the question results and the team could go back and see what the entered originally and make changes when we repeat the exercise, which we plan on doing a few times a year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to come up with a feature/set of features, and getting a bit stuck. For the purpose of this question lets say its the ratio of number of times a person clicks on an ad (abbreviated ac) on a website/ time they are on the website. Here is an example of what I'm thinking about:
 subject 1: 3 hrs on reddit, 2 ac. One hour on facebook, 5 ac
 subject 2: 1 hour on reddit, 0 ac, three hours on twitter, 2 ac
 subject 3: 5 hours on live journal, 1 ac.
 In this example I would create 4 features: ac/hour reddit, ac/hour facebook, ac/hour twitter, and ac/hour livejournal. I'm having trouble with the fact that these four features will have a lot of missing data. In this particular example, pretend that I've collapsed the webiste categories as much as possible. What are some other options of dealing with the data? How does one use data like this in a model without imputing the missing values? I'm open to not using a ratio for this feature set - but I do want exposure to the website to be included somehow.
 Thanks!
 Edited to add, the missingness comes from the situation when someone has 0 hours on the website, its 0 clicks/0 hours so its undefined. This is a different situation than a zero someone who is on the webiste for 5 hours but never clicked on an ad.

I have the following plot (figure), and I would like to show that in the central region there is a linear pattern, and find the correct line with linear regression (I know how to do linear regression). 
 The problem here is how do I decide to exclude the data that stands on a line parallel to y axis or x axis? Is there any statistical test to do that?
 The data is the measure of two continuous variables, so there is not an "a priori" method to exclude some of them. 
 Thank you in advance!

What i'd like is for them to be able to tell a dashboard "what happened to our customer reviews last week?" and a text summary is generated and parameters to charts sent out, and charts generated
 I'm exploring the aspect of cost here 
 I read Azure's OpenAI marketing and see:
 > Azure OpenAI Service is enabling customers across industries from health care to financial services to manufacturing to quickly perform an array of tasks. Innovations include generating unique content for customers, summarizing and classifying customer feedback, and extracting text from medical records to streamline billing. The most common uses have been writing assistance, translating natural language to code and gaining data insights through search, entity extraction, sentiment and classification. 
 Great
 But the pricing looks expensive for Base Series Fine-tuned, Curie:
 > Inferencing per 1,000 tokens | $0.002 
 > Hosting per hour | $0.24
 and so i'd need to think about some caching intermediary stage to prevent too many calls to the Azure OpenAI API
 So is using Azure here for an ai based solution cost effective for a small business?

I am a solution engineer, but always wanted to be a data analyst or data scientist because I believe that data can be harnessed for many practical application e.g., (chatgpt craze). Regardless, this takes me to my few questions:
 ​
 1.) What tools and framework have you used recently for your big data analytics project, and would you considered adding any tools (automation) to your tools set in order to simplify your data process? 
 2.)How does the framework you are using scale to handle the ever-growing big data?
 3.) Are some of your clients that you work with driving the adoption of AI and automation? I know my company I work for is already looking at integrating Microsoft teams premium because of the features found in chatgpt and how some of my clients wants the to be able have the capacity to automatically generate notes in case they miss the meeting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, my close colleague at work had an interview with Sr. Director of Analytics (or maybe just a Director, I forgot), for data related opening. 
 He was asked to describe what would he do with 3 data points, representing 3 months, say month of January through March.
 I confirmed with my colleague that it was not 3-month (or 90 days data), it was just literally 3 data points, for example sales revenue for those 3 months.
 My hunch at that time was, either the person smoked something, or he blew the interview on purpose, as the recruiter told him the very next day as they decided to “promote” from within.
 I did try to think a variety of ways to derive meaningful reference based on 3 numbers, but eventually I told my colleague that most likely the interview was fake.
 I guess I want to know from different perspective, whether you can actually use 3 data points in a meaningful way, for business.
 Any taker?
 Update: as suggested, the company he interviewed with was F100, big in Telco.

 I’m a Product Manager with 10 years of experience in B2C mobile apps. I love mobile apps and I’m really passionate about user experience.
 However, I lately started using various AI products and I’m really impressed. Since I believe it the future I was thinking if it’s possible to start learning the basics and even make a career change in AI development (as soon as I learn what fields exist). I have studied computer science and I’m familiar with software development. 
 Any idea/recommendations where to start from and what a possible career path would be?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious because in my "small" experience of +4 years last friday I did an interview for a small company, when they asked me about using git or control version somehow I was totally honest and said something a long the lines "look I know what it is and how it works but because I like to learn but in these bigs companies in my resume at the end of the day they care more about having results as soon as possible with nothing or very little documentation rather than doing things properly, so I did as they ask". They started laughing like some joke saying "oh wow I cant imagine working like that what a mess" I dont think they really care since as they also said is something you should get used to easily (plus I'm gonna reject them). 
 So I'm just curious how many of you really work using git? PS: My profile is data scientist/analyst using Python.
 Update: As Im reading all of you I see that I need to change that because for me and the company so... this week I'll start to use it 100%. Also I'm giving some more info about why I think I didnt really work with it in the past: - No production deployment ("if you can run it locally why waste money?") - Really small teams where normally very few projects where really done by more than the person itself. - When I tried to bring it in the past It was kind of a mess for me without anybody helping, and It was hard for me to defend why since I really didnt know either. - Normally when I tried to learn something new I used to focus on new libreries, best techniques/coding practices and my next step was about docker and production deployment but before that Im focus on the git.
 I want to thank all of you for your thoughts, I'll keep replying later.

 For my weekend project I figured I would build an AI driven spiritual successor to Mystery Science Theater 3000... Stop on by and watch the AI characters watch movies and make comments!
 Today they are watching "The House on Haunted Hill" and "Plan 9 From Outer Space."
 There's still a lot to do but I'm excited to play around with this more and see how it plays out and would love some feedback!

A miss in the updates can break the whole thing, which can be frustrating rather than focusing on my tests. Also it becomes tedious too when someone checks up on it and it takes a long time to backtrack on everything.
 We've tried using the timeline feature or tasking in Asana but its quite tedious as well to track and keep tickets or are we just doing it wrong? Lately we've been planning on trying out to setup like a kanban thing but just wondering if there are any best practices for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read before on Reddit as well as on blog posts about data science professionals landing a job and thinking that they finally get to apply their skills to do something cool, when they had to instead do analysis on excel. 
 Also data scientists in some companies who aren’t sure what goal they are hired to achieve. Or they don’t even have the right data to work on. Or their work never makes it to production because of some reason or another. And they get disillusioned.
 Recently I came across this post on data science in finance. And the description looks pretty interesting. 
 https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/data-science-in-finance/
 Are any current Data science professionals who are in the financial industry. Who can shed some light on this? 
 Is the work really as described? Or is it better? 
 Do you get interesting problems to work on? 
 Do you feel you get an opportunity to make an impact with your work? 
 Do your models make it to production?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a small engineering firm. I have been tasked by my CEO to train an AI to solve what is essentially a regression problem (although he doesn't know that, he just wants it to "make predictions." AI/ML is not his expertise). There are only 4 features (all numerical) to this dataset, but unfortunately there are also only 25 samples. Collecting test samples for this application is expensive, and no relevant public data exists. In a few months, we should be able to collect 25-30 more samples. There will not be another chance after that to collect more data before the contract ends. It also doesn't help that I'm not even sure we can trust that the data we do have was collected properly (there are some serious anomalies) but that's besides the point I guess.
 I've tried explaining to my CEO why this is extremely difficult to work with and why it is hard to trust the predictions of the model. He says that we get paid to do the impossible. I cannot seem to convince him or get him to understand how absurdly small 25 samples is for training an AI model. He originally wanted us to use a deep neural net. Right now I'm trying a simple ANN (mostly to placate him) and also a support vector machine. 
 Any advice on how to handle this, whether technically or professionally? Are there better models or any standard practices for when working with such limited data? Any way I can explain to my boss when this inevitably fails why it's not my fault?

 I love memes from r/memes and r/dankmemes community, but it was hard to save and find them in albums. So I made an app called MemeSearch that could search a specific meme by text or content.
 App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1668297986
 You can search in two mode:
  
Text Mode. Search text keywords in that meme. (Which I use OCR to extract from image.)
 Content Mode. Just type "two man fight", or "grandpa holds coffee, laptop" could work.
  
And it's completely free: NO ads, NO subscriptions, NO in-app purchase, this app is made for fun.
