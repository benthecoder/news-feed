        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was contacted by a recruiter of a staffing company where he asked if he was interested in signing a contract with them to work with one of the FAANG companies. 
 I am a new grad having a hard time finding a full time DS job right now. I’ve never thought about/heard things about working for a staffing company, so I wanted to hear some opinions. 
 Have anyone worked for a staffing company or heard things about working for one? It'd be great if you guys could share what your thoughts are. Thank you.

 I'm currently working as a data analyst at a marketing comp and have a masters in analytics. Been on the job for around 6 months now. I like the company and culture but it's mainly data visualization work and I do want to be able to use some Python/R (more technical work) and modeling in my role. Thinking I should start preparing to apply to some roles in a few months, but wanted to get some thoughts on what the preparation/application timeline should be like and the roles I should be applying to. Thanks!

Those require decent prep especially if they are technical interviews or involve a take-home assignments. Not even an email after these stages is such an insult to the time spent.

Often these datasets contain frequent label errors and/or missing tags (check what we found below in the CelebA dataset) that make it hard to train highly accurate ML models. Support for multi-label data was one of the top features requested — so we added it, benchmarked it, and published all of the research.

 Now I don’t have a ton of experience in time series but took a few udemy courses and all and understand the basic principles.
 However since I have to create 50+ forecasts, I can’t really go one by one and identify the best pdq values for each business unit.
 So I created a function to just iterate through a bunch of SARIMAX parameters (p, q, seasonal pdq, trend) and just use the model with the lowest MAPE score. The function doesn’t iterate through d but it tests for stationarity and proceeds accordingly.
 The model results, for the most part, look good. I’m just wondering if this is just inherently wrong or if there’s a better way around it.
 Thanks!

 Or is there any convenient residual blocks (preferably tensorflow) available that I can plug and play?

 The issue is i’m already a junior with only 3 semesters left and getting a minor in CS or stats will be very tricky cause the courses build on each other and there are about 7. If i decide to do this i might end up staying in uni for an extra semester. But i don’t want to do this if a minor won’t really make a difference …]]></summary>

It's used for measuring the exact changes in variables that lead to other changes in other variables.
 I guess I just don't understand how is this any different to Predictive Analysis? What type of statistical tools / methods would this type of analysis use?

 Variables:
 I have N+1 variables
 -1 categorical variable: the state of the light (on/off)

 Aim:
 I want to gain insight as to the lights general effects on each brain area. e.g. What area is most influenced by the light, What area is least influenced by the light.

I can blog, for example. But when I try to write fiction everything freezes up on me. So what I'm looking for is a program where I can basically type in an outline and then have it give me a first draft. Does anything like that exist yet?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenAI released an update to their davinci model in GPT-3 (the text-davinci-003 model is the new one). I wanted to have some fun with testing it out, so I gave it this prompt:
  
Describe what qualities would make post titles perform well and perform poorly on the /r/artificial subreddit. Give an example of a good post title and bad post title for a post about the latest update to GPT-3.
  
response:
  
Good Post Title: "What's New in GPT-3? Unpacking the Latest Update"
 Bad Post Title: "Look What I Found! The Latest GPT-3 Version Out Now"
 Good post titles on /r/artificial have some combination of the following qualities: they are descriptive and to the point, they demonstrate knowledge of the technology discussed, they are written in a conversational style, they are explanatory rather than promotional, they use relevant keywords, and they provide something of value to the readers. 
 Poor post titles on /r/artificial may contain clickbait language, appear to be written for the purpose of promotion, lack punchy words, be too vague, or include offensive language.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone
 I am very interested in the field of data science and considering a career transition to it and I needed your help with a particular decision. 
 For background, I am currently working in marketing and have a bachelors in business administration. I have also taught myself a fair bit of front-end web-dev (mentioning this to show that I am proficient in self-learning)
 I am currently considering doing a postgraduate diploma in applied statistics. Its a 12-month course consisting of 2 sems. 
 In the first sem, we are required to do 6 compulsory courses in statistics and some SQL, and for the second sem, we are provided with the option to do specializations in either advanced statistics, or data science where they'll teach python, R, etc.
 I was wondering if I should do the advanced statistics and learn python and R and other tools on my own. Or, do the data science courses and the knowledge of fundamental statistics from first sem would be enough.
 Detailed pic of the curriculum for reference: Applied Stats Curriculum
 Edit: If you feel something completely different from all of this would be a better alternative, you can suggest that too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am applying for an MS in data science and was wondering if it was alright to ask a professor in the anthropology department for a letter of recommendation. I took 3 classes with him within the biological anthropology field, and a lot of his lectures encompassed concepts in data science. He and I have corresponded over the past month and he’s helped me a lot with grad school planning. Even though he isn’t a professor in math, computer science, or statistics, would he still be a suitable person to write a letter? Or would it be better for all of my letters to be from math/stats/biostats professors? 
 My only concern is that I took a lot of my upper-level math courses during the height of the pandemic, and all of my classes were online, so I didn’t get to know those professors as well. What is the best approach to take? I already have a letter from a math professor that I was a research assistant for, but I still need 2 more.

 Forecasting and time series in particular have been home to magic, religion, mathematics, and science for the last millennia.
 Successful forecasters carefully observe and associate sequential events. Undoubtedly science's progress and the age of information have replaced superstitions in favor of a deeper understanding of the natural processes determining the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[They want to track the speed of a long process across its different stages. Currently they are using Average number of days for completion of all cases as a metric. Naturally there are a few uncontrollable outliers which take too long to complete, which affects the overall average. 
 I suggested we use Median/Percentiles instead of average, but few people seem to disagree. Their reasoning is that Median is less sensitive to individual cases. For example, if the current Median is 50, and if we manage to improve speed for cases which take 1-49, Median won't be able to track this improvement. Similarly, if we manage to reduce the speed of cases taking more than 50 days to a number which is above 50, Median won't be affected. I believe this line of reasoning is somewhat unjustified for avoiding using Median.
 Their proposed solution is to compute Average after exclude 5-10% of the longest cases. They will decide what % of cases to exclude (threshold) after seeing what the numbers look like under different thresholds. To me it seems they are just abusing the data to suit their agenda.
 Even one of the higher-ups wants to implement this solution. How do I politely point out to them that what they are doing is considered as abuse of data? Or am I wrong to think so and what they are doing makes sense?
