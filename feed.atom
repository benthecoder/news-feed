 I'm a seasoned cybersecurity analyst (threat hunter) and have been focusing on applied statistics, data science, and machine learning (classical and deep learning) for the past few years. I also am a full-stack engineer, which helps when creating tools and analytics. I've taught myself statistics and probability, linear algebra, and a little calculus, as it's necessary for fully grasping a lot of DS/ML frameworks and methodologies.
 I've really struggled with imposter syndrome since I've started trying to break into data science and machine learning. It seems almost everyone has a masters (or two) or a PhD. Education-wise, I have enough credits for an Associates but didn't get the degree. I was…]]></summary>

What I am having a hard time finding and understanding is how does one ETL or where does the archived data from oltp database go? does it stay in the the oltp and you just create conditional table or does the DW just hold it after query? Any books, articles, or youtube videos would defiantly help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After using ChatGPT, I feel like I'm using technology from ten years into the future. It's fucking mind-blowing. I'm almost certain that in the near future, AI will be better than any human at any skilled task. AI will have the ability to start companies, make amazing original music, movies, video games, etc. I'm not trying to be pessimistic or dramatic or anything, I'm just making a claim based on what I know and how fast I've seen this technology develop. Then you start to wonder, well, if in society, we value skill, and we pay money for skilled work and time, what happens when there is not longer a scarcity of skill, and a machine can do in seconds what it would take an MIT graduate to do in hours, days, months, or even years? How will our society operate? I actually don't know. I think its very probable that everything will fall apart. I'm genuinely kind of worried.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So far I was thinking, and what I'm currently extracting:
  
Sleep data Huawei watch and Cpap recording breathing. If I get 
 
Diet, My Fitness Pal / photos of all food, Extract of my grocery shopping
 
Weight and photos of body, body fat scanner (I do weekly), Dexa scan
 
Workout tracking - map my run, constant HR scanning from Huawei watch, and also my Pacemaker data which is very fine grained and 3 months stored at a time. 
 
Bank transaction summaries (day or weekly summary as % of my income) 
 
Map data
 
Happiness with Daylio, and a simple summary of my day, and also I can randomly poll myself for a word to describe how I feel, 
 
Work Kpis (keystrokes / ratio of delete key, tasks sold, hours billed, quality of work, cust satisfaction) 
 
Summary of medical issues and data. 
 
Subjective surveys. 
 
 Im very aware that my address, and a lot of my personal interests would be public, but I suspect that it could add some benefit by being a data set that scientists were looking at.
 I could have the base data of a year's data avail open source, and then 2 or 3 layers more detail avail on application for those who ask. 
 Im happy to add in any other measurements that people want or need. 
 I would like to make this a standardised data set, and I'll commit to 3 months, if it works, then 1 year. 
 I will want it mainly using passive or easy collection.
 I can obfuscate my name and I will have gaps in data for privacy at certain times.
 What am I missing? 
 What are the best standard formats?
 What is a good way to put all the data into a usable framework? I thought To load it all as CSV into Access or SQL.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can anyone recommend some of the coolest latest AI technology out there for average people like me? For instance midjourney creates computer generated images based off of a text sentence. A website called LALAL can take a song and strip it of vocals to just give you an instrumental version. And then there’s Nvidia canvas which lets you draw very primitive images and it turns it into 3-D landscapes. I’d love to hear other peoples recommendations for cool AI websites/technology they’ve run into this season that can be used to do creative things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, 
 Thank you for stopping by and reading the post. A little background of me; I’ve recently graduated from Dental Hygiene School, and have a B.A. in Biology. 
 I’ve had a rough start in my hygiene career, but thankfully landed at a great clinic along an amazing team. 
 Dental Hygiene takes a huge toll on the body overtime, and I may have a rheumatoid condition. It’s put a few things in perspective, and I might wanna veer away from the career and move towards something else.
 I’ve studied biology and in the midst I’ve taken classes for Stats and Calculus and really enjoyed it. I’ve never coded and have no real computer knowledge outside of PC gaming, plus I can be lazy at times and have difficulty problem solving individually. I enjoy presenting, and love explaining things in ways for people to understand what I’m talking about. I ask a lot of questions in regards to how and why things are done in specific ways. One big driving force for me is having a team to support 
 For those who have more insight in this realm of careers,you think someone like me could potentially be a great data scientist?

 I am in the process of applying for a data analytics internship position. Obviously, it would be beneficial for me to showcase some of my projects somewhere. I am thinking of creating a file on Google Drive that would provide a direct access to my projects.
 Now, is this an ok move or should I instead display my projects on Github? Mind you, I don't have much time left before the application period ends, and also I am not comfortable with using Github.

 also i suck at holding myself accountable, anyone up for teamup learning?

 (Btw, I would appreciate it if we could please avoid becoming distracted by the pros and cons of Agile/Scrum. That is not my intent. 
 I am just curious which data science jobs/careers do NOT use it. Thanks!)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I've developed a project NaimAI, to help PhDs and scientists in their scientific literaure review. To describe it brievely, it has 3 main features : 1 search in papers, 2 structures abstracts into objectives, methods and results and 3 generates automatically a (pseudo) literature review.
 I wrote a medium article that goes through the details.
 Github repos : https://github.com/yassinekdi/naimai
 I've created a subreddit in case : r/naimai4science
 I'd be happy to have your opinion about it and hopefully this could be useful!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the human skill that made our species do great things, but also bad ones, is our imagination. From majestics architecture, heartbreaking novels to fantastic art and awesome music, the human always learn the craft diligently, by going trought a trial and error process. You can see an artist do trial and error to compose a new melody, same for a visual artist or for a writer. This "trial and error" process is what make us learn our craft by experiencing the bad and the goods practice, by using our imagination.
 - What happen to our craft and imagination if we delegate this trial and error process to AI?
 - How could we still find joy and fulfillment if we are no more in that deep flow state?
 - Isn't it just in the struggling part that we always manage to push ourselves further, and thanks to our imagination, find new ways to solve that creative problem?
 - If we entrust the creation, trial and error process to AI, as a basis on which to entrust our creativity, are we still using our imagination, or just working on something AI has made for us?
 - If we use AI in our creative process, does that mean we are not using our imagination, so, we are no more developing our craft/skill?
 What's your feedback and opinion on this topic?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am really interested in DS but my GPA (3.2) is not enough for a graduate degree (bad grades on the first year) in my country. SQL and tableau feel very simple and unchallenging compared to building models in R or python. In the short term I will have to find a job after my upcoming graduation and I feel like finding a DA role will be much more realistic for me. But I don't want this job. What should I do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was just curious about if every company could benefit from data science. I'm currently 2 classes from my undergrad in computer science and will also start a bioinformatics masters puritan next semester. I realize bioinformatics and data science are two different things, but that them to be similar. Just the idea of being able to come up with solutions to problems a company didn't even know they had seems pretty exciting. 
 I'm just fascinated by the DS field, don't know why as I don't know anything about it. Guess I just really love building and figuring things out with code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a data analyst and regularly produce insights, and sometimes models. Stakeholders most of the time do not utilize the insights or models I produce. They mostly just give a thumbs up and say nice work or interesting and then the work never gets used. It pisses me off because I feel like I'm not making an impact. There's only been a handful of times my stuff are used. 
 It also could be that maybe the stuff I'm giving isn't that amazing but I have an eye for it. Like I know which stuff was just okay and which stuff was great. I'm starting to feel that either people don't have the mental reach to understand what I give or maybe they think it's just not useful.
 Recently I made a purchase prediction model that predicts if a customer will purchase or not based on their app usage data. We can literally use this in marketing campaigns to target only those that have a higher probability or purchasing. But there wasn't that much of a hype around it. 
 I just want to move the needle.

 So I saw some advice on here saying that for your resume you should very concisely state what you've done and what was the effect. This was very easy to state in my old job where we created new reporting startegies that we could evidence generated X amount of commercial uplift. In my current job, I joined a brand new team to just create reporting where there was none, I've had to learn a ton of new skills to do this but the financial effect isn't as pronounced,the only thing I'm aware of is that it has helped the exec team be aware of how close they are to their targets, pointing out any red flags that may result in penalties from the client and provided overall greater sight of issues on the contract. Are those good enough effects for my CV to not go straight in the bin and if not what would be.

 Company has to buy back product from Customer if there are any issues in product (12 months of purchase and other conditions based ) 
 Now I have data for products which were bought back by company.
 For non buy back product data , should I include only the product which satisfies the criteria (12 months of purchase and etc.) or all the product data including which has surpassed the criteria (like 12months and etc.)
 I hope I am able to explain the problem. Looking forward to get input from the community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello I am working on my first data science project and my hypothesis is that colexification (when words share a meaning) increases with high levels of affect and arousal.
 So I have this dataset where I’ve extracted all the words that have a shared meaning, and how many different languages that they have a shared meaning accross. I’ve then taken two lists of words with their affect value (-1 to 1) and arousal value same scale. And extracted all the word pairs with a value. 
 So I extracted the top and bottom quartiles of the most and least colexified words across languages. 
 I was told that a t-test would be a good test for my hypothesis but I can’t exactly figure out how to do that? Would I be doing a single t-test and using what mean? The mean for the whole set or just the sample? Or a paired t-test? There’s 18000 words in the top quartile, and I did a linear regression and it has a small positive Pearson r value for affect and small negative r for arousal which fits my theory. 
 Also, what type of visualization do you use to illustrate a t-test? 
 Any insight or help would be welcome as I can’t seem to think clearly about this.
