        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN! About a year ago i stumbled upon the world of swords, knives, and EDC gear. A weirdly addicting (and expensive) hobby to have.
Back then i noticed something, it was quite tedious to easily sift and search through knives based on length, steel, brand, and what not to find the knife for me. There were some great youtube channels that helped me pick out what i wanted however i had to sit through multiple 30 minute videos just to review 10-15 knives or so each.
Recently i've been having a little trouble sleeping so i decided to pickup a new passion project to work on late at night, here's KnifeGeek!
it's a completely free website where you can search, filter, and sift through an extensive knife database (over 60K+ knives) and add them to your collection or wishlist. You do need to sign in to add stuff to your wishlist or collection and after a bunch of advanced searches.
Please check it out and let me know if you think anything is missing! I'll try to flesh it out more on a daily basis if people find it cool or useful.
Planning to add in price comparison functionality and more data per knife in the next week.
PS: Images are a little shoddy, working on that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to create a brand new data system for my company. I managed to create Python scripts that pulls data from APIs, wrangle them into a Pandas DataFrame, and export them into an Excel file. We are trying to do this process automatically daily on the cloud, store them in BigQuery, and display them in Data Studio.
 This is the system that I have in mind. I put the scripts on Cloud Functions, but instead of export them into excel files, I use pandas_gbq to store them to BigQuery. For the cron jobs, I use Cloud Scheduler to trigger the scripts on the Cloud Functions by sending HTTP requests. What do you think of this system?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to describe mathematically a strain pattern of a structure (civil engineering) that I analyzed with FEM. I extracted a 'line' of mesh nodes from the fem analysis and found the constants for the approximation function f(x) using lmfit (least squares) with python. I have 4 constants (a,b,d,f) and want to link those constants to geometrical properties of the structure. I already determined the value for 'b' and know that 'a' and 'd' are somewhat associated with one geometrical dimension. I have determined the geometrical parameters that influence on the strain and want to determine the value for the f(x) constants based on this geometrical dimensions. I have 35 different fem simulations, varying the geometrical dimensions of the structure.
 The question for you guys is: is there a software where I can input the function (and its determined constants values obtained with the lest squares approximation) and the geometrical parameters from the structure and get some correlation? (like the 'a' constant from f(x) is 2/54* (geometrical dimension) ). Or a way that I can do it with python, perhaps. 
 ​
 here is the f(x) and the 'b' value. 
 the 'b' value on the geometry. I have the g' value that I want to correlate with 'a' and 'd', and some other geometry dimensions (thickness, for example)
 ​
  This is one of my functions, and its approximation with the values of the constants (for the positive and negative values of z, as the function is not symmetrical).
 ​
 the report that I get from the lmfit analysis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello humans! A project is about to start (https://github.com/neuralshare) which will allow any device, even low-cpu, to use and interact with AI models that they could not use since they require so many hardware resources. The project is called NeuralShare and will use the Stellar network to achieve its goal, as you can read on the README on Github at the link on this post. More specifically, it will use the Futurenet network and to achieve its purpose it will use the NEUR token, also on Futurenet, which was already created a little while ago and has no real value, has no speculative objective but only has one purpose, namely that of the project. We plan to distribute this token as an airdrop, totally free of course, and anyone who has this token will be able to use and interact with GPT-3 or other AI models for free simply by sending a NEUR transaction with a text memo attached containing the prompt. In return you will receive back a transaction with a text memo containing the response. However, this will only be possible when there are enough nodes (go to github to understand why),the precise number of nodes that must be active before the response can be received is still to be defined . For more details and updates you can add yourself to Discord, find the links on the README file on GitHub, as well as more details on the functioning of this method which will also allow you to use GPT-3 for free and without an api-key

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34602444</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/TunnlTo/desktop-app"/>
        <updated>2023-01-31T21:28:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
TunnlTo is a tool for controlling which Windows applications, processes, and IP addresses can use a WireGuard VPN tunnel. Here are some examples of how it could be used:
- Route only FireFox through a privacy VPN
- Route Slack and Microsoft Office through a work VPN
- Route a game through a gaming VPN
- Stop a game from routing through a privacy VPN
- Stop a browser from routing through a work VPN
- Route a specific IP address range through a privacy VPN
- Route all traffic through a privacy VPN except a specific IP address range
I have been collaborating on this project with the creator of WireSock - Vadim Smirnov.
"WireSock VPN Client is a lightweight command line WireGuard VPN client for Windows that has advanced features not available in the official WireGuard for Windows such as selective application tunneling and disallowed IP addresses.
WireSock VPN Client combines the power of Windows Packet Filter and BoringTun (user space WireGuard implementation in Rust) to provide exceptional performance, security and scalability."
The TunnlTo app is built with Tauri and I've used boring old HTML, CSS (bootstrap) and JavaScript as I had major JS framework fatigue. I have previously built a production app with Electron and Vue. Tauri appealed to me for its use of Rust and its small installation sizes. I tried Tauri pre version 1.0 and had a bit of trouble but this time around its been a positive experience. The docs and the Discord community have come a long way.
I would appreciate any feedback about the project so I can get an idea of what direction to take it in next. Vadim will be around a little later if anyone is curious about the WireGuard implementation and wants to know more.
Thanks for reading!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tried finding something like this on the FAQ, but didn’t see anything written out. I’d like to have a discussion about what sort of projects hiring managers want to see. Obviously, real world projects are going to be more desirable, but in some cases this isn’t possible. Or at least, in my case. I wasn’t ever able to take home artifacts (dashboards, slides, notebooks, etc.) from my previous work, as it was sensitive data. The only other projects I have are just college ones, which were less impressive Kaggle problems. My current role is data scientist by title but our ML projects just keep getting delayed for other things, so no work there. 
 So, that leaves me to building out a portfolio of personal projects.
 What do people in the space want to see?
 What’s interesting to me personally, is being able to look back at my college problems and examine why my approach was incorrect using my real-world knowledge. So a good project might be using the same dataset and methods, with a write-up of how to improve it.
 Otherwise, I’d just want to do some projects that seem fun to me.
 So hiring managers, or senior roles, what are the best projects that you’ve seen someone talk about in an interview?

> Your private repository baobabKoodaa/laaketutka-scripts (forked from futurice/how-to-get-healthy) has been deleted because you are no longer a collaborator on futurice/how-to-get-healthy.
That was an MIT-licensed open source project I worked on years ago. We published the source code for everyone to use, so I certainly did not expect to lose access to it just because someone at my previous company has been doing spring cleaning at GitHub! I had a 100% legal fork of the project, and now it's gone... why?
Turns out I don't even have a local copy of it anymore, so this actually caused me data loss. I'm fine with losing access to this particular codebase, I'm not using HN as customer support to regain access. I just wanted everyone to be aware that GitHub does this.

 I am working a BI Engineer and have a decent working knowledge in SQL (intermediate), Tableau(basic), Snowflake(very basic), Informatica/ AWS(almost nil since contractors do the Data warehousing and ETL, Data laking etc).

What coursework/certification courses links do you strongly suggest that can help me truly be expert in my role?

 I'm trying to compare this degree with MBA from Purdue Global which has a Data Analytics concentration. 
 Was the instruction high quality, and would you say the time and effort was worth it? Are there a bunch of exams you need to cram for? Is it a degree mill? 
 Were people able to secure jobs or promotions in Data Analytics or engineering with this program? 
 I currently work as a software developer full-time and am looking for a shift into Data Analyst or Product Manager positions.

 i'm training a multi-class classification model and I would like to ask the following question:
 Assuming the model should differentiate between 10 variations (A to J), if A and B are similar (or whatever letters), then how can I somehow give a bias to the model to take that into consideration ? Currently, I am doing a "hot zone" in the confusion chart, so that the user knows to take these results with a grain of salt. 
 Any hints would be appreciated!
 P.S: programming language doesn't matter even a math wikipedia page would be nice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently a year out from finishing my masters in computer science from a well regarded school, emphasis on software engineering. My background is in chemical engineering so a masters is useful for transitioning fields. I work as a test engineer in aerospace, which is giving me some exposure to software (matlab, labview, networked systems). My masters program has the option of taking an additional 6 courses (about a year part time) and letting me get a second masters in data science. Work would pay for it completely. Is it worth it to get the second masters? Or would a boot camp or online course be more worth my time and effort? I’m not dead set on becoming a data scientist, but it would be nice to have the skills under my belt if a project needed it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last December, Heroku nuked the database on one of my active projects.  I was travelling at the end of the year and did not catch wind of this until I returned and saw messages about an issue with the app.  Sure enough, I checked and noticed that the database was gone and detached on December 9th.
Before the hate comes out, yes I know Heroku deprecated free tiers.  However, I did not understand this would affect my projects on paid dynos.  The real issue here is that I never received a single email or notice of any kind to my email about this.  From researching, it appears most people received SEVERAL notices about this.  I did not think there was an issue with my setup because I received zero communication.
Upon reaching out, Heroku has told me that they cannot recover the database.  They also admitted that there was "an issue" sending out notifications to me, and confirmed that none were sent.
So I guess just a warning to all - your database might be nuked at any time.  I learned my lesson about not doing an offsite backup regularly.  I guess the bigger lesson though is that Heroku should really be a last resort option for projects these days. RIP.

 ​
 I'm in the process of clustering my companies customer base and wanted an opinion, at previous jobs, when I would build customer segmentations, I ran one cluster, did some EDA, and if everything looked good, would present it to the higher ups.
 However, for the new segmentation, I'm wanting to cluster based on engagement (sales totals, basket size, etc.) and on behavior (so product interaction like 'bought family products, etc.). My thought was to build two models, one with engagement metrics and then the other with the behavior indicators. 
 I'm curious if this would be the right way to go about it. Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever been asked to illegal things with data? I ask this question because I went through this a few years and want see how other people have handled these situations. My situation started out as on honest mistake where data was accidentally excluded i noticed the mistake and the inclusion changed the results significantly..... this on top of being told my "results" were not right when it didn't project good findings for the client. I ultimately refused and insisted that if my manager wants to submit the work they can do the modeling themselves and then lie to the client themselves... Normally whistleblowing is the best here but when I did that I was further harassed by management. All the whistleblowing did demonstrate immoral behavior from the top down. Ultimately I was taken off the projects and basically paid to job search. I am in a much better role and dont think it will happen at my current company but, just wanted to see if oneone else has experienced something how would you manage it if it happened again.?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All --
 I've been in IT for about 15 years. I started as a sysadmin, segued into dev work, and have been specializing in systems & data integration and business process automation for the past 5ish years. I also studied Computer Science for 4 years but never graduated (that's a whole other sobstory -- won't bore anyone with that)
 I've been considering the direction I want to go for the next leg of my career and I feel like AI/ML is the logical next step.
 I've started building a portfolio of my AI/ML projects and I'd like to pick up a cert or two to compliment them. My ultimate goal is solutions architecture, but I love the engineering side of things and expect to start there.
 What I want to know is what certifications everyone would recommend -- I've been eyeing the IBM-sponsored certificate tracks on Coursera but I've seen a few others and they all have their merits. I'm just not sure how much value they carry in the job market. Are there any worth staying well away from?

 ​
  
Did you observe superior performance to classic ml-algorithms?
 Any tips when applying transformers for time-series data?
 How computationally expensive where they compared to classic algorithms?
 Would you recommend using such models for demand forecasts?

 Thank you for any shared thoughts, resources, articles or threads!

Its since been 'fixed' and I have been reassured it's actually happened before (EDIT: the keys been compromised before but I don't think to this extent) - but I still feel horrified and upset about causing the issue to begin with.
 Does anyone have advice on how to best move forward from this incident with my mentors and boss? I am afraid the team will second guess assigning me more tasks/opportunities in the future.
 Edit 1: Also if you could share mistakes you've made at work that would make me feel better too
 Edit 2: Thanks for the replies - there's been a lot of great advice commented and its definitely helped soothe my nerves :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps I am alone in the walled garden that I’m forced to work in. I do population health analysis of approximately 100,000 lines of varying data. The nightmare of my life is that I cannot use any scripting. No python, r, macro-enabled workbooks. For visualization, can’t upload to anything as it’s protected health information. No Tableau, no online SQL database, no power BI. All I can use is Power query/pivot. 
 I admit, I can adapt and overcome with being hamstrung like this. However as the data grows, Excel is starting to give out on me. I’m looking to see if anyone has methods that they use to clean data and present basic visualizations outside of excel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently finished my first year in university for Data Science and completed an internship for data analysis over the holidays. I would like to gain some experience and work online on projects, not solely for the money but also to earn some extra cash.
 I am a beginner in the field, and I was thinking of researching the most in-demand skills on Upwork and learning them. For example, scraping data from a real estate website to predict prices. I plan to practice these skills using online data until I feel confident in my abilities then get started applying for jobs on Upwork. I also am considering cold calling local businesses.
 Is any of this a good approach? If not, could you suggest a better plan? Please be radically transparent.
 I posted this on r/careeradvice and got no comments, so I thought this would be the place to go.
 tldr: finished first year university/college (data science) and would like to get started freelancing, where do I start?
