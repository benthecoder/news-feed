        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I am an intermediate statistics student currently working on a project which involves analysis of likert scale data(range 1-5, 1 being "Completely Disagree or Least Likely). The dataset contains a few other customer specific information like race, gender, age, location, income group etc. The remaining columns are the responses of customers to a survey questionnaire in 1-5 likert scale. There are total 25 questions and therefore 25 likert columns. 
 The end objective is to understand customers attitude towards a product , based on survey responses. 1.How do I go about modelling such a project? Someone in my group suggested using hierarchical models ( not sure weather the frequentist or Bayesian hierarchical model). What would be the response variable in this case, since I have 25 likert columns that could be treated as the response variable. 2. How do I measure the effect of one variable (say income group) on the customers attitude towards the product? I have already performed clustering techniques to segment the customers and develop a profile. I have also performed Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney U test to see if there exists a difference in attitude based on income group for each survey response.
  
If I decide to model using Bayesian hierarchical model, how would I choose a prior for the likert data points? One likelihood that comes to mind is Xij-1~Binomial(4,pj) where Xij is the survey response of the ith customer for the jth question and pj is the prior parameter for jth question. However, I don't think this would be correct as pj will lose its interpretability. Is there any other way I can specify a likelihood and a prior?
  
Any help in this regard will be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I’ll try to keep this post as short as possible. Basically deciding between two Data Scientist job offers and having trouble evaluating which will be best for my near and long term future. 
 A little info about me: graduated with a undergraduate degree in Econ/stats and worked for about 2 years for a mid sized CPG company as a data analyst for a little under 2 years. Spent the past two years completing a masters in data science at Northwestern University (had the option of doing part time but I decided to quit my job and do full time to really focus on the subject). 
 My goal was to break into tech but my graduation perfectly lined up with the tech industry turning into a complete dumpster fire right now, so I barely got so much as a call back from most of my target companies. 
 I am currently deciding between two job offers: one at a consulting firm as a data scientist for their banking risk group and the other as a supply chain data scientist for a large healthcare/medical devices company. In my opinion, the consulting firm is extremely lowballing me (88K) while the healthcare company surprisingly exceeded my expectations (110K-120K) in terms of salary. I am currently in the process of seeing if the consulting firm can raise the salary because I do believe it is a better job in terms of the requirements and how it will look on my resume. 
 I just wanted to get some fellow data scientists’ opinions on a few things: 
  
Is the consulting firm really lowballing me or is this a reasonable salary?
 
If my eventual goal is to break into tech (FAANG), will one of these experiences look better than the other? 
 
Given I’m currently unemployed, paid about 60K for the masters, and was making 70-75K at my job pre masters, what would be a “reasonable” salary to ask for?

 List of courses (choose 4):
  
Survival Analysis 
 Statistical Quality Control
 Spatial statistics 
 Multivariate Analysis 
 Non-parametric regression 
 Time Series 
  
I think Multivariate Analysis and Time Series are very important and I think NP regression could be useful in Time Series analysis, but as for the other I have no clue. What do you think? 
 Thanks.

 I can import tidypolars and the data just fine:
 import tidypolars as tp rents = tp.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-07-05/rent.csv") 
 But when I try to export the data frame as a csv file:
 rents.write_csv("rents.csv") 
 I get an error stating 'super' object has no attribute 'to_csv'.
 I’d be thankful for any suggestions. The data come from the Tidytuesday repo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking at a career change - I have a background in psych and neuroscience, and work experience primarily in mental healthcare and education.
 I have minimal experience with anything CS related, though I tend to pick up math and computer related info quickly. I did a fair amount of stats in my undergrad but haven’t done calc since high school. I’m fairly interested in health data science, though from what I’ve read getting experience in general DS is a good path as it leads to more flexibility.
 Right now I have some options. I could do a 2 year postbacc in CS (this would lead to a BS in CS in addition to my BA in psych/neuro). Alternatively I could spend a year doing prerequisites then do a year long MS in data science. Does anyone have a sense on which would set me up better to get into the industry? I’m fairly personable and feel I could network well in either program. 
 Also I know there are a variety courses for getting into DS, but I’m hesitant to go that route as my current degree is not that analytical. 
 TIA for any knowledge/as suggestions!!

Today I got an email inviting me to an OA to finish within a week. I’m currently pursuing a masters in applied mathematics and have quite okay knowledge (which needs some brushing up) on statistics and OK on modelling/programming.
 After reading up some things on it online I don’t have enough time to get ready for the assessment in time, since my exams are coming up. 
 Would I burn all my bridges by saying I don’t have time available to prepare for interviews at this moment, but am still interested in the future?
 In hindsight I never should have applied in the first place obviously.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Everyone! 
 I’m a college sophomore who is a Math major/digital and computational studies minor(digital analysis-esqe program). I go to one of the prestigous New England liberal art schools(context for limited math or engineering exposure)
 I’m interested in data analysis/data science careers but I feel that I’m underprepared. Through coursework, I have experience with Python and R. Through my upcoming summer internship, I’ll get more exposure with Python and SQL. By the time I‘m a junior, I should have decent exposure to programming languages and numerous math courses under my belt. 
 However, I feel underprepared when it comes to searching for data analyst/scientists internships for my junior year. These sentiments probably rose from dropping data structures class freshman year(planning to retake junior spring) and never taking algorithms. I don’t have any projects or such on GitHub but should start posting some next semester. 
 What can I do to feel more prepared for the careers I want? Is going to graduate school necessary for me? Do yall have any programs, in or outside of school, I can involve myself in to better nuance my education?

 ​
 I'd like to have a career that involves math and computation, which is why I'm drawn to data science. However, I really don't want to work in a field like big tech, finance, marketing, defense, etc. Ideally I'd love to work in conservation in some capacity. If not, then at least something like medicine or education or non-profit work. I don't especially want to go to grad school, but I could if it would lead to the type of role I want.
 ​
 Does anyone have any advice about data science careers I should look into? Or anything mathematical outside of data science that I should check out? 
 TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the important but often forgotten parts of building a good classification model is probability calibration. 
 Imagine you’re building a churn model. 
 To make optimal business decisions based on the output of your model you’d like to know now only whether the prediction is positive or negative, but only what’s the probability of a user churning. Based on that probability (and a couple other things) you can weigh the cost of retention actions vs expected gain for example. 
 You can use model scores (what you get when you run .predict_proba in sklearn). Contrary to the method name, these scores are actually not probabilities unfortunately. 
 These scores would be probabilities if a probability of 20% would turn out the be positive 20% of the time model returns that probability. 
 However, most of the ML algorithms that are able to capture non-linear relationships, also tend to return scores that are not probabilities (as in the picture in calibration plots). 
 Fortunately, there’s a way to post-process the scores to turn them into probabilities. 
 Long story short, we can simply fit a function that will straighten the calibration curve after we create it by binning model scores and calculating the fraction of positives for every bin. There’s of course a bit more nuance to probability calibration, but this post is already too long 😅. 
 Then we add this simple regressor at the end of our prediction pipeline and instead of getting just the model scores, we’ll get properly calibrated probabilities.

 My wife and I recently returned from a cruise and we read that they generally look for trends in your orders when you use a drink package. They can see alternating orders or something outside of your normal orders to flag if you are abusing or sharing the drink package. 
 How is this implemented? With such little data on a short cruise, how can there be effective trending to flag these kinds of kinds? I'm just curious on everyone's thoughts since this sounded like a really interesting application of DS.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
In the last months I've been working on Unclutter, a modern reader mode browser extension. In contrast to all existing approaches, it unclutters articles by modifying their CSS instead of extracting the text content.
This results in a more visually pleasing result that reuses the original article style. The idea is to remove friction so you use the reader mode more often.
There are a few more features around saving articles automatically and taking highlights -- more details are on the website.
The extension has about 400 active weekly users right now, mostly from organic web store traffic. Monetisation has proven to be hard and for freemium there would need to be much higher numbers anyways.
Do you think I should keep working on the project?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to data science and machine learning. Currently I'm working on a project where I want to build a model, based on four inputs. The data is based on properties of a certain class of chemicals. One of the columns is categorical, based on what type (chemical structure) each chemical is within the class.
 The thing is, the amount of data points (rows) in the set is a bit over 100, and due to missing data, and more importantly, due to needing certain correlative criteria to be filled (f.x. rows having similar temperatures), I only end up with 20-50 data points to use to build a model.
 I'm using scikit, and I've tried linear and polynomial regression, as well as support vector machines. They all perform horribly, and I've kind of concluded that I have too little data. But I don't want to stop. I've tried googling, and I'm coming across some information on how to approach small datasets, but I wanted to ask this forum, how would you approach such a problem? What ML algorithms are relatively well suited for a task of this kind? To regurgitate, I'm trying to build both a regression and classification model, with four inputs, using 20-50 data points.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm interested in making AI for games but literally every video I have seen where people do this the first step is to always re-code the game. I understand that this makes training faster because you can directly simulate the game and you have easy access to data and variables you may need for training such as position of a character, health, etc. For games that are more complex where it would be next to impossible to re-code the game, is there any way to get around those constraints? Thanks!
