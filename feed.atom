        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is actually not my academic interest (in fact it has nothing to do with this), but I have collected a lot of single-board computers & microprocessors (as a hobby). So please ignore my technical ignorance.
 I own 8 Raspberry Pi 4 boards, and I want to build an 8-node Raspberry cluster. Why? It looks really cool (I love cable management), but to be honest, I have no idea what I will do with it. I actually do a lot of things just for fun.
 I do know that people use Raspberry cluster for pedagogical purposes (introducing students to cluster computing; mainly because it is much cheaper to build a Raspberry Pi cluster), and I would love to give it a try as well. However, in my opinion, it is so inefficient to use Raspberry Pi clusters for machine learning as it is more efficient to use a GPU instead.
 Still, I wonder if there is any application of a large Raspberry cluster in Data Science?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently a graduate student (Ms cs focused mainly on ml/dl/nlp) at a top 10 university. I am interested to do research in the field of multilingual nlp, low resource multilingual nlp. Though I haven’t done any research in it yet(just getting started ), I’ve been doing few courses online on advanced nlp and multilingual nlp. Trying to find some papers to go through on those topics but clueless which are worth reading and which are a must read. Highly appreciate any recommendations on a list of papers to read or courses or books to read to get better. Any tips for eventually getting admitted into that Ph.D. would be great. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I want to share a browser extension that I have been working on. This extension is designed to help programmers get assistance with their code directly from within their Jupyter Notebooks, through ChatGPT.
 The extension can help with code formatting (e.g., auto-comments), it can explain code snippets or errors, or you can use it to generate code based on your instructions. It's like having a personal code assistant right at your fingertips!
 I find it boosts my coding productivity, and I hope you find it useful too. Give it a try, and let me know what you think!
 You can find an early version here: https://github.com/TiesdeKok/chat-gpt-jupyter-extension

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those unfamiliar: Lift and Leverage are commonly used metrics in eCommerce/basket analysis to measure the relationship between items.
 The formula of each is:
 Lift(X > Y) = Support(X&Y) / (Support(X) * Support(Y))
 Leverage(X > Y) = Support(X&Y) - (Support(X) * Support(Y))
 From a very high level, one is division, and the latter is difference.
 Lift has a range of [0, inf], whereas Leverage has a range of [-1,1].
 Would it be correct to state that Lift measures the scale/intensity of the relationship given its range, and Leverage measures the sensitivity?
 If not, what would your recommendation be as the best way to describe these metrics using a 'business-centric' vocabulary?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have had an idea that would need a data scientist. What would be the best way to find a data scientist to talk through this idea.
 It's really early on in the idea stage, and would love to ask some questions to validate if it is possible. 
 I would be willing to pay/work with or compensate in some way for their knowledge and expertise. Just really excited to see if this problem can be solved with them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a press release by the NHS, they said “Use of cutting-edge AI technology is associated with tripling of patients recovering and able to perform daily activities from 16% to 48%”
 Now that's a tri-ing jump, get it?
 How does it work? I hear you ask
 The technology analyses the brain CT scans of stroke patients arriving at the hospital, taking less than a minute to identify the type and severity of the stroke and the most appropriate treatment.
 Doctors can then quickly offer drugs or surgery, with the technology shortening the average time between patients arriving at the hospital and starting treatment by one hour - from 140 minutes to 79 minutes.
 This one is most definitely a GAME CHANGER, saving time, money, and Lives
 A massive win for the AI Community.

 I approach this topic not as one who is passionately interested in AI as much as I do as someone who loves reading poetry. As such I really just try to evaluate it in its own terms, and hence it may be of some interest for you. I looked at three criteria: the music (how metrically correct it is), the language (the complexity and flair of the language) and finally how much it touches the reader.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently in a Master’s program and I’d be taking a lot of applied statistics courses throughout the program. I’ve always had an interest in data science and I attempted to start learning on my own 2 years ago, however, I didn’t see it through cause I lacked a good math background (I couldn’t follow some of the online courses).
 Now I just got into this master’s program in a completely unrelated non-technical field, however my advisor has a strong statistics background and our research has a lot of statistics undertones so I’d be dealing with a lot of stat work. I started thinking if this would be an opportunity for me to get back into data science either in the academic or professional field.
 I restarted an online course I used to do before (dataquest.io) and just like before, I freaking love this and enjoy it. I totally feel like I would be extremely happy with a career in data science. So my question is if you think I can sufficiently learn on my own and start a career in data science without a degree or having much technical background. My current master’s program might help but only a little.
 Another option for me would be to do another master’s program in data science right after this one. My issue with this is the finances. I’m fully funded for my current program, however, I would need to probably take out a loan to do another master’s program. Is it worth it to go this route or do you think with enough passion and determination, I can sufficiently learn on my own?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data Science began as a specialised branch of statistics to one of the most in-demand professions and the sexiest job of the 21st Century according to the Harvard Business Review.
 One of the major players in the early history of data science was John W. Tukey. He was a mathematician and statistician who is credited with coming up with the term “data science” in the 1960s(a fun fact you might want to mention in your next Data Science Interview).
 The mass adoption of personal computers in the office and at home saw the emergence of data mining algorithms, and the rise of new tools and technologies for data analysis and visualisation.
 Personal computers made data analysis and visualisation more accessible and affordable, leading to a significant increase in the amount of data produced by society.
 Data Engineers were born to build and maintain data pipelines to collect, store and process millions of terabytes of valuable data, whilst data scientists came to fruition to make sense of the data society was creating and transfer it to tangible business value.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm an individual with a BSc in Software Engineering and MSc Data Science who is building up a portfolio and trying to break in the data science field.
 I wanted to ask users of /r/datascience what sort of tools (if any) you use to do the planning and track issues and TODOs with your personal projects (if any).
 While my bachelor's degree in software engineering covered project management in part, but what I found lacking in my MSc degree was the planning and management perspective, specifically pertaining to data science projects (in contrast to software development/engineering projects). I'm curious to hear whether you think there's a difference between the two and what tools/tricks you are using or have used in the past to enhance your portfolio?
 I'm a fresh grad so please take my question with a grain of salt - I do not have experience in the field yet but noticed the lack of teaching about project management techniques while I was writing my dissertation - I understand that data science is vastly more closely associated with statisticians and applied mathematicians who probably are not as familiar with issue tracking software as software developers are and perhaps fairly so, because while stats and math skills are mostly timeless, software tools for managing and developing software are not. Nevertheless my currect thinking is that projects in my personal portfolio would be vastly improved and perhaps more stand out by not only providing GitHub links that "show off" my data science skills but project management skills as well. 
 What are your thoughts on this and what tools (if any, and preferably free) you use to manage your personal projects?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently read this article and thought of using ChatGPT. I've been chatting with ChatGPT all week, bouncing ideas off of it to get it to help me flesh out my thoughts.
 I found out that these technologies are iterative. One is built on top of the last one, and each new iteration is more powerful and increases the potential for discovery in some exponential way. It's like a whole new level for these machines to grow and improve, and it's opening up all kinds of possibilities for what we might find out. Also, something like this has been going on for a while now like (JasperAI, CopyAI, Copysmith… the list goes on… maybe Google is even going to join the bandwagon with Google Assistant? Who knows).
 These technologies are also seriously disruptive, like we've never seen before. If you don't believe me, just spend a week chatting with ChatGPT or something similar and see for yourself. It’s obvious that these tools (yes tools) are going to be like a boost to our own creative skills, not to take over or anything, just to make them even better.
 So for those creative workers out there like copywriters, graphic designers and web designers, instead of worrying that you might get replaced, you can instead use this technology to your own advantage. You can use it for ideas for blog topics. You can also use it for design ideas and templates for your graphics and website. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.
 People are worried that these technologies might take the jobs of regular humans because they can help companies get stuff done with less people. But I think it's important to think about how these technologies are affecting us and to make sure they're used in a responsible and helpful way for everyone.
 But AI is changing fast, so it's tough to say for sure how these technologies will play out in the future. We’ll see in 5-10 years at least how much AI will improve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello: 
 I started off a job as a "data scientist" in Department X of my company. I did primarily data engineering work building out data pipelines and standardizing some things to make reporting (of which we do a lot) more automated and efficient. I liked the work. Bosses liked the work. Things were going well. 
 The whole IT department got shook up in Oct. with entirely new structure more or less. Because my technical work making their pipelines was so well-received, I got told I was getting moved to the IT department as a "solutions engineer II" working under the architecture team. Doing basically what I had been doing, but for all departments (this is a small firm). I've been given some tasks, but they aren't related to data science. The tasks are tremendously important and needed to be done like yesterday, so I understand the urgency and why I'm not doing data-related work right now. I can't shake this feeling that I might be pigeon-holing myself in terms of a career. This is because this title I've been given from what I read is either 1.) quite nebulous or 2.) tech-jargon for "salesman" generally. 
 Does it make sense to talk to my manager about this? If so, how?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So after completing my Masters Program, I did notice that I learned some pretty novel things in the field that can give me an edge in the market since when I talk to other Data Scientists, they may not be as aware of some of the newer approaches and architectures. My question is, how long does it take for your average DS/ML/AI degree knowledge to become outdated due to how fast these fields move?
 I feel like the knowledge I have is only going to give me an edge for maybe 2 years before it just becomes common knowledge to everyone. I've had professors in the past say that on average it should take about 5 years for what you learn from a degree to somewhat obsolete, especially in technology-related roles. However, I feel like in DS the window must be much smaller than that. Was just genuinely curious as to what others' thoughts were.
