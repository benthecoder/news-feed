My experience has been building dashboards on personal projects. I know a little dax. Would also be possible to master the basics Python and it’s libraries as well as SQL? I haven’t been applying because I’m scared, but I wanna be prepared.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I just botched an interview question related to how to use linear models for inference, and wanted to get your guys' take on how to appropriately approach the question as well as resources on how to learn more so that I can appropriately answer the question next time.
 I interviewed at a health tech startup offering a mental health service. They have data on people who use their services versus people who use traditional psychotherapy, and want to analyze whether people who use their proprietary service spend less money overall on healthcare bills.
 As part of the question, they asked how I would find other factors related to how these groups differ. I said that you could use linear regression to learn about linear relationships of variables in the data. They asked how this would work. The interviewer suggested using money spent on healthcare for a given month as an outcome variable and what service they used a binary regressor, and then suggested adding new variables to that equation to test for their efficacy. This, in hindsight, makes sense. I instead suggested using what service they used (traditional psychotherapy vs. their proprietary program) as a binary outcome to a logistic regression, and then introducing variables to see what makes these two groups different. In hindsight, this doesn't relate to the question of money spent on healthcare for a given month and doesn't make much sense.
 I want to have a stronger grasp of this problem and an understanding of how to solve similar ones. What are peoples' thoughts for this problem here? Does anyone have suggestions on resources to learn more about using linear models for inference?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an embedded SW dev who had to help a company once to optimize their data pipeline so they could do computer vision on an edge device (an Nvidia Jetson, in case you were curious).
 I'm wondering, is this a common issue that companies have? I've heard that ML inference is starting more and more to move to the edge devices instead of being run on the cloud. How do companies deal with having to optimize everything to run on a low-power, low-RAM device instead of the usual power hungry desktops or cloud services?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, in 2020 I was hired into my old job as a data analyst, (thought I knew excel…I was very mistaken) and learned a lot on the job about excel and dove into VBA a bit at the end. This year I switched jobs to what I thought would be similar at a family friends company but learned it’s not, and I’m just generally not happy at the job, so I’ve been thinking of going back to do a data science boot camp to learn python, R, and visualization of data and SQL. I don’t have a 4-year degree but worked in my data analysis entry job for 2 years and loved it then left for more money which I regret. So my question is. Do you think data science boot camp would be worth it for me to do? Or are they not looked at very highly like say other boot camps? I know data science is what I like to do so that’s why I’m thinking of going back. (Plus if I stay at my current job I will explode)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the option of continuing my current course, or enrolling into another university.
 The challenge is completing a Statistics Major, or graduate without hardly any Stats courses for Data Analytics & AI.
 Option 1:
 I continue, major in AI & Data Analytics. I finish in 2 years (3 years if I take up honours). However, the university hardly offers statistics courses along the AI major. I would learn this entirely on my own, separately, which I am willing to do.
 The downside is, my resume has online Stats courses as opposed to a Bachelor.
 Option 2:
 I enrol in a new university (which is highly regarded). I finish in 4 years. I take up a double in CS (major in AI) & Science (Statistics). A solid in-depth study course. I'm assuming this gives me a leg up.
 Just wanting to get any feedback from anyone in the industry. Looking at employability and potential quality of work produced.
 I'm an extremely detailed person, and love to produce good work. Is this still possible if I have to teach myself statistics undertaking online courses? (One thing I love about university is the ability to continuously and intensely build on top of previous knowledge, and then use that knowledge. Online courses seem superficial, by comparison, not giving me that opportunity).
 Time & Energy reserves are a concern.
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't really know anything about AI but after reading a bit and seeing the recent hype this question popped into my mind.
 For example, with self-driving cars. I was thinking that maybe it would be technically possible to create one using conventional programming, but realistically speaking this would take such an impossibly long time that it would never be viable, because of the complexity. So you use AI to train the car to drive itself instead. 
 But with conventional programming, someone has intentionally written all of the code to do specific things, so it can all be explained by the creator. If you're using the AI like in this scenario, to create something that is basically impossible for a human to program themselves, does that mean we don't actually know how it is working? 
 I get that you have the basic principles like the neural networks on which it is trained, which you would need to know to create and train the AI in the first place. But after that, you can't actually explain the decisions it's making? You just know you asked it to do something, and you know it worked because it did it. 
 Is this wrong? I would love to hear more about this. I was thinking this would be especially dangerous with very intelligent AI. To rely on something whose decisions you can't explain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the past year or so I've been a bit unhappy at my job and have started applying around. I can easily land interviews due to my work experience + education, but I have trouble in the technical portions due to not really preparing due to a lack of motivation. I'm right around the mid point of my career where work, although interesting, is not really one of my priorities in life anymore. I do what I need to do, collect that sweet DS paycheck, and go enjoy my other hobbies on my downtime that give my life fulfillment. My job involves a fair deal of SQL, Python, and ML/stats, but it's a struggle for me to sit down and grind out SQL/Python questions, or go back and re-read ML/stats fundamentals to explain to someone how to mathematically breakdown a logistic regression or explain gradient descent.
 Seeking advice from others how they stay motivated or what they did in scenarios like this.

 Within an hour, I recieved this Instagram forward about the same peculiar from my friend, which appeared in their reel (I rarely browse Instagram reels): https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cjk-ZU1jEBa/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=
 How is this possible?
 Neither me or my friend consume aviation related content online. Does Meta have access to my YT history somehow, identify the content and suggest the same in my frequently contacted persons insta feed? Are these shenanigans by the latest AI algorithms?
 How is this even possible? It's freaking me out.
 Edit: I don't use my real name on my YouTube account, use ABP, disable cookies, me and my friend don't share an IP address/location.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently work for a small startup as a DS and find myself acquiring a lot of different .py files full of useful functions for ETL, modeling, and visualizations. Usually, I just import them into a notebook and run my data through the functions I want, depending on the tasks. However, as my team grows I thought it might be useful to share some of the functions I made. Instead of just throwing several .py files at them I thought I would build a little app with a GUI for some of the more repetitive tasks. I started reading into PySide2 but quickly ran into a problem.
 The problem is I don't know the first thing about structuring an actual program. I come from a mathematics background so for me coding is just a means to an end but I really want to grow and learn how to do this. I have a general understanding of classes and how to use them but have never really needed to. Does anyone have any resources, tips, best practices for creating an in-house tool that can be iterated over time?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been asked to work on what's basically a forecasting model, but I don't think it fits into the ARIMA or TBATS model very easily, because there are some categorical variables involved. Forecasting is not an area of data science I know well at all, so forgive my clumsy explanation here.
 The domain is to forecast expected load in a logistics network given previous year's data. For example, given the last five years of data, how many pounds of air freight can I expect to move between Indianapolis and Memphis on December 3rd? (Repeat for every "lane" (combination of cities) for six months). There are multiple cyclical factors here (day-of-week, day of month, the holidays, etc). There is also an expectation that there will be year-to-year growth or decline. This comprises a messy problem y…]]></summary>

 I've done a few freelance projects and I have the impression that the pay is better as a contractor, but the projects I've worked on have been few and far between so I don't know how likely it is as a contractor to be employed most or all of the time.
 Does anybody has any insights into the pros and cons of long term freelancing as a data scientist? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello humans of reddit :) 
 For my master thesis I want to extract political relations from news paper articles. Now one of the many challenges I am facing is that often the countries are not directly mentioned. 
 Two examples (from the top of my head) are:
 "The white house criticizes this" -> I want to map the white house to the US
 "The mayor of Berlin had a call with the mayor of Kiew" -> Berlin should be mapped to Germany and Kyiv to Ukraine. 
 Do you know if there are any dictionaries or existing ontologies I can use for this problem? Any help is highly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow data scientists! I'm currently working on a project where I'm clustering phrases using sentence transformers (bert). How can I use these clusters for classification from another algorithm? (If it's even possible). I couldn't find any resources on this. Like an xlm-roberta does multi label classification and I'd very much like to use that on the clusters that came out of a sentence transformer.
 If anyone has an idea on this. That would be really helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I have a research project that is outside of my wheel house of normal activities and methods, so I am looking for advice on where to start, or maybe just how to format my request into language that helps me find results.
 So first of all context:
 I have a property advertisement dataset ( at a rough guess about a million separate properties). A fair enough of info is already in a nice format (e.g. a numerical value for the number of floors, a easy to work with string variable for a property type indicator). However, the issue is that I have a lot of info in just a free text entry provided by the estate agent...likely highly embellished but still useful as this is where they write things like "utility bills included", "only students" etc. Some of which I already know to try and look for, others I don't know yet.
 So my question/request: How should I start go about structuring this text into something useful for me? Any suggested resources?
 Thanks for any help!

Thus, I performed 1-hot encoding and calculate distances with the Jaccard Index. So far so good, but after evaluating results I am sure that features have unequally importance. Question: I want to put special emphasis on some features such that similarity in these features account for more similarity overall. Simplest idea in my mind is to duplicate these features in my data such that these have double weight. Do you have ideas? Thank you!

As a computer science student, i am genuinely inclined to code my own decision trees in python including those that requires equation without libraries such as numpy and panda.

 It’s me again, you gave me some great advice on some job offers I had as I want to head into Data Science:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/w3sgea/is_econometrics_a_good_route_into_ds/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
 I went with Econometrics. It’s been ok but I feel like I want more from it. It’s no DS but it is still regression and modelling but the tools are internally built so I’m not using Python, SQL or ML as I did in my DS rotation. I am still doing learning on the side and mini projects to develop my experience though.
 I began applying for DS positions to get experience of interviews and identify my gaps in terms of DS knowledge and experience.
 I received an offer today for a Data Scientist Consultant position. It’s a small consulting firm (<50 people) and it’s a mix of analytics, engineering and DS. It would require a lot of self learning as they don’t have DS’s atm, it’s a request from clients who want DS.
 I would be leaving a large international company for a smaller firm but it would be the kind of relevant experience for DS which I’m not getting atm in econometrics. I’m also hesitant due to the state of the economy atm, what with impending recessions and whether it’s worth leaving a stable company at this point in time. The clients are public sector but it’s a variety of data and would require initiative from me which I’m happy to do but would appreciate your advice once again please?
 I am happy to discuss over DM too

full read/write access to prod where DS team experiments with new models
 read access to prod, write access to sandbox/data science zone. Develop training datasets off of prod data and write them to sandbox for experimentation.
 no access to prod. When I start a new project DE team copies the data I need to dev environment for experimentation.
