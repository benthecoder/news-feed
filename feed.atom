 Tldr; changing focus on job search. Skilled in analysis and data infrastructure/process improvements, but coding skills are still very early. Any stepping-stone roles that won’t have me starting super-bottom entry level? Where my existing expertise is useful but admitting a need for development won’t doom me? 
 Long Term, I would love to straddle the area between data engineering and analysis, and lead a department in effective data processing and insights. 
 I have long loved data analysis work, and it is absolutely a strength of mine. I have a PhD in political/economic sociology doing macro-level quantitative research, and taught our department’s stats course a couple semesters. So I’m well versed …]]></summary>

A few minutes ago, I received a pretty nonsense spam mail to that address.
I contacted Amazon support who said 'we're investigating' in a way that made me think I might not be alone.. and advised I forward it on to stop-spoofing@amazon.com.
Just curious if anyone else has recently had similar?
(To head it off: no it shouldn't be third-party sellers - they don't get your email, any disputes etc. are through a unique-id@marketplace.amazon.co.uk address in my experience.)

        <link href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33036748"/>
        <updated>2022-09-30T16:07:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About a month ago, Microsoft SmartScreen suddenly started flagging the login page of our SaaS dashboard as 'unsafe', scaring away our customers.
We understand false flags can happen. So we took to the official SmartScreen feedback site to report the false flag (as the website owner). Received an email that stated it would take up to 24hrs to analyse: 'If the status of your site has not changed after 24 hours, please contact us with a reply to this message'.
Sep 8 - first ticket sent.
Sep 9 (24h later) - nothing. So we replied to the message as instructed.
Sep 12 - still nothing. One more reply sent. Asked some of our customers to report our site as safe.
Sep 15 - crickets. Tried calling phone support, impossible to get through; they just hang up on us. Reached out to MS support on Twitter, said they would look into the case.
Sep 22 - no changes - MS twitter support has been unable to find the correct person internally. We replied to the SmartScreen ticket once more. Opened two new tickets. Asked more customers to report the site as safe.
Sep 30 (Today) - now the warning has started to spread from our login page to our entire dashboard. Still no word from Microsoft.
We are totally baffed that MS allows a false flag to stay up this long, totally ignoring us for almost a full month, meanwhile destroying a business that did nothing wrong...
We suspect one of our competitors is responsible for falsely reported us. Is 'weaponized SmartScreen' a thing?
Does anyone have a similar experience? Any advince on resolving this matter is greatly appreciated!

There was a discussion on HN a few weeks ago about how a developer shaved off almost half of their native app's code without losing functionality [1]. Our launch today is a direct outcome of that thread and, moreso, in the context of this comment [2] and this one [3]. Paraphrasing the context below:

Followed by:

People saying that it's stealing, "not real art," "not real artists," lazy, dystopian, evil, and just downright immoral.

 As an artist (not to humble brag) but I worked goddamn hard to do what I do! I practiced really fucking hard and didn't give up. At the same time, I am immensely privileged to have had the time to practice, study, and money spent on classes growing up, and on quality supplies.
 But not everyone has that.

 I’ve been learning a bit of scala the past few weeks and am really enjoying it but from what I gather, the language doesn’t seem to have much of a foothold in the data science/data engineering space, even among Spark users.
 Just wondering if there’s any practical benefit to continuing down this path or if it’s a complete waste of time. I’m getting kind of bored with python and really just want something new to explore.

I don't fully understand what a data lake is - or a warehouse for that matter as I haven't worked with one yet. But my question is are they actually useful and if so - why are people complaining?
 Are people complaining about data lakes because theirs is badly implemented and/or badly understood and/or badly integrated in the day-to-day work? Or are they complaining because as a concept ("just chuck everything in the same place and forget about it. Maybe someone will find a use later ") data lakes are a suboptimal workaround that doesn't address a companies actual data problems?

 I am a Data Analyst and trying to gain a basic understanding of Apache Spark and have been stuck on some technical definitions of this framework, particularly its most advanced technique: distributed computing. 
 As PySpark is introduced as a better solution for large datasets over Pandas (as it runs on 1 computer), if I execute a script, where is it running on actually? I only have one PC, what distributed computers in this case means? 
 I need some English explanations for this topic as all I google out were technical terms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm 1 month into my first Product DS job (junior level), and although I've been doing primarily ad-hoc work for now since I'm so new, every problem is super interesting. I'm writing SQL every day, merged my first PR today, and soon will be taking on an automation project in Python. 
 No more spending hours adjusting charts to make the deck look "pretty". No more being told that my headlines are not "insights". No more tedious Excel or SPSS work.
 I've been waiting for so long to get into DS, and it's everything I've ever dreamed of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently first year Bsc Physics with Data Science student, just started university last week.
 I have zero experience in programming, I just started to learn Python few days ago (not really necessary as I will learn it anyways as part of my course in a couple of months along with a few other data science modules, but I think earlier I learn Python more time I will have to make projects and move on to learning other stuff). As a student with no background in programming and who is not studying computer science, what tips would you give me to be prepared for data science internship? I am hoping to be able to get internships by end of summer of my second year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm a researcher using fMRI to study the brain. I was wondering if there were any neat methods to perform a more large-scale and interaction-based analysis of the brain response. For example, I have many areas that respond to stimulation and at first, I used to make a scatterplot showing the response ratio of one area to another, but I want to expand this to many others to find a possible trend or interaction effect between areas. For example, some show horrible response in one area, but response in another is good. (I get confused if I should exclude this sample or if some interaction effect is occuring). The ideal goal would be to predict all other area's responses based on one or two area's response. I hope this makes sense and would appreciate data scientist's expertise. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tag-based file management seems like a great idea, and would address a lot of the shortcomings of hierarchical directory structures. However, the tools that I have found for tag-based file management on Linux — TMSU, Tagsistant, and TagSpaces — have some severe limitations.
Are there any good options that I have missed? What tool do you use, if any?
Thanks!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I work in data and starting also my foray into AI. One use case I'm beginning to explore is using CCTV and sensors to profile travelers e.g. cars, pedestrians for counting and profiling purposes i.e. car type, direction of travel, gender, devices used for purposes of understanding users and maybe identify potential merchant partners for nearby locations or ads
 What are the thoughts of the sub about this with respect to approach and methodology? Appreciate your opinion on where to start

 I'm dealing with a database with two free-text columns: City and Occupation. They have several similar (but not equal) inputs that should be given the same name. Is there an automated way to give the same names (not merge rows) to similar texts? I'm currently working with pandas and google sheets. The text cells are in Portuguese. 
 Thanks in advance.

 I've been using R and Python for over half a decade now but have yet to learn a low level language.
 I've used Cython for some projects, but without any real knowledge of C or C++. I've never tried out something like rcpp (I'm an opportunistic R user primarily).
 I've run into some points in the past where it would have been helpful to avoid Python/R entirely (except for maybe a CLI wrapper tool).
 I'd like to pick up one or the other, but I'm not sure which is a better choice. Right now my application is mostly theoretical, so it's a skill building exercise
 I have a few thoughts about advantages at disadvantages. These obviously aren't facts, just leanings/concept…]]></summary>

The thing is the job is a 6 month contract and while they have a very strong history of hiring contact employees, in the interview i asked what the odds were of me being hired and he said he couldn’t have a solid answer and that the budget is decided in the new year and it was out of his hands. He made it clear that he was very interested in having me become a full time employee. 
 Another thing he mentioned that kind of through me off was he was suprised about the fact that i had a full time job and wasn’t currently doing contract work. He then said “i shouldn’t really be saying this but as a friend i would be hesitant about leaving a full time job for a contract esp bc he cannot gaurentee me full time and that with the way the economy is going it could be risky”
 Would love if anyone would like to weigh in. I like my job now but this raise would be great and the company is a fairly big one that i would love to be at. I’m fairly early in my career with only 2+ years of experience. Wondering what the job market would be like in the event of a crash.
