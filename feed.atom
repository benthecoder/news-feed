        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, From your experience, what models would you consider for product assortment/range optimisation for FMCG retail sector ( i.e getting the right product range in the right store/ product placement).
 I’ve seen some use XGBoost for product placement, but curious to know what other models work well.
 I know we have to take product substitution into consideration so Customer Decision Tree Model is already taken care of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering about political candidates. Could they be using AI to find out what to say and not say, and to write speeches to improve their chances of getting elected? Is the military using AI do improve military scenarios and design more effective weapons? Is the Federal Reserve Bank using AI to make financial decisions? Are investment banks using AI to model stock and bond markets, to improve their performance? Are American military experts using AI to help Ukraine succeed on the battlefield?
 If so, how much of this is really secret, and how much known to insiders but just catching the public eye?

I've always been seeking for jobs that are more on the technical side so I dont have to communicate much in english. Recently, I've grown an interest in becoming a data analyst but afraid that my english is not efficient enough. Can anyone tell me if excellent oral and writing skill will be required? thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys!
 Just looking for some guidance. I have a degree in liberal arts, whack degree I know; I spent way too much time goofing around in college and when graduation time came, it was either get the liberal arts degree or spend another 3ish semesters studying. I ended up taking the liberal arts degree and bouncing, probably should’ve stayed in school but ohh whale, but I’m reaching out because I’ve been playing with new ideas. 
 I would really like a to get a job in data analytics or data science. I’m aware that a degree makes getting a job in that area 100x more easy and I’m willing to go back to school. I have two options right now: I can go to a Purdue sister school, Purdue Fort Wayne, and do in person classes. Or I can do an online bachelors program at IUPUI, a sister school of Indiana University. Housing would not be an issue for either since I live 10-15 minutes from Purdue Fort Wayne and iupui classes are online. Price is similar.
 I’m just worried about workplaces not valuing an online degree.
 Any input is appreciated.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, as the title says I am planning to attend and begin UNC Charlotte's Master's in Data Science and Business Analytics and wanted to get a second opinion from people in industry/students. I graduated with a biology degree in 2021 and since have dived into coding, math, stats since school and want to further my education. I understand that OMSA has a program for 10k but I want a program in person where I can develop connections at the same time. UNCC's program is slightly over 20k and has many connections with industries in the area and host a myriad of seminars, career fairs, and have a great placement rate. Now my question is, would the time investment be worth it to develop connections and deepen my analytical/technical skills at this program vs working my way up as an analyst? My goal is to work as a data scientist or a machine learning engineer and potentially work my way into management later on. The link to this program is as follows: https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=33&poid=8834
 Thanks in advance for all responses and insights!

I made a site which displays the most common useragents found on the web.
The site updates weekly with data sourced from the server access logs of another site I run in order to give an accurate picture of the devices and browsers being used on the web.
I do a lot of web scraping in my work and it's this group of people who I had in mind when creating the site.
The data is presented as useragent, browser, os, and relative percentage of occurence. It can be viewed as a table on the site or via json in the API.
Please let me know your thoughts or feedback and I hope you find it useful!
Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN, Is this a known thing? I'm pretty frustrated, and even given my near-complete disillusionment about capital-driven-tech these days, I can't believe Google is doing this.
I just got home from being in Mexico where I used my VPN (because of course US financial apps panic if you access them outside the US).
I fired up my LG TV running the YouTube app (which I'm not signed into) and every, single, ad is in Spanish.
My Edge browser on my desktop computer gives results in Mexico and claims I'm in Quintanna Roo. In many places, I cannot override this, at least without signing in and/or apparently explicitly feeding it more accurate location data to "fix" it's perception.
Is this expected/known? At one point, it even said "based on your IP address" despite the fact that my IP clearly looks up to a Washington State IP address.
I just wish I could make this known to Google's advertisers. Are they aware that when I travel, they're pay to show me ads that I can't understand?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Working on a time series classification project. I’m going through the sktime library and reading each and every classifiers summary about the method that’s being used under the hood to fit the model, and I’m basing my choices based on how long it may take to train. For example, half of them are distance based (nearest neighbors) methods, and I know for my dataset a distance matrix (and most data in general) just takes a stupid amount of time to compute. Or some do Shapelet discovery, which is traversing the entire subsequence space and computing distances between the subsequence and original series and using those subsequences (shapelets) to predict, which also, takes a long time. So I’m just avoiding using them for others (interval based)
 Does anyone else do this? Is this a bad practice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello scientists,
 I have some basic data, more like a very basic personal project, and I want to find a way how to visualize it in a nice way. A three circle Venn diagram is not enough, I will need something like a "oval flower model" with multiple intertwining and mutually intersecting fields.
 The basic tools online and in Excel seem not to be self adjusting based on how much text I want to put into the image (some fields require a lot of it). So I would like to find an online tool which can create a beautiful visual representation for me and which would automatically adjust the size of the diagram fields. 
 I am not proficient yet in advanced tools or programming languages like R or Python, so I would like something simple.
 I am sure such a thing exist, I just suck a bit at finding it. It seems very easy, something that would look like this but that would automatically adjust the size and shape:

 Does your security team have a process/tool in place to access the decryption key(s) from your code? Are there other limits on what you can do/can't do?

It tries to solve the LLM hallucination issue by guiding it only to answer questions from the given context instead of making things up. If you ask something not covered in an episode, it should say that it doesn't know rather than providing a plausible, but potentially incorrect response.
It uses Whisper to transcribe, text-embedding-ada-002 to embed, Pinecone.io to search, and text-davinci-003 to generate the answer.

 They won’t like knick knacks like a mug with an AI generated dog, or a t shirt. They would just throw that out. What would be a great gift is something (not a book) that allows them to explore, learn, or experiment with ai more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to set up an unsupervised learning project for anomaly detection and I'm learning along the way. Since I haven't got any previous experience with unsupervised experiments, I have what is probably a very basic question with regard to setting up my experiment: is the basic approach for unsupervised learning broadly comparable to that of supervised learning?
 My intent is to go with a data split of 70:15:15 (train/test/holdout) and do an EDA on the data. I want to check how meaningful certain features are, whether they correlate etc.. Then I'll drop features and/or engineer derived features and see how they cluster and whether PCA will result in any insight with regard to feature relevance?
 Since I'll likely use the insight of the PCA to inform the feature engineering, I think a holdout data set is necessary - at least in theory. However, since anomalies are both _anomalous_ and sparse, I'm not really sure whether this can actually be practically implemented.
 Any pointers to best practices or or design philosophies would be much appreciate by this unsupervised newbie. ;)

 Something that
  
lets you choose modules with different configuration (GPT-2, GPT-Neo-1.3B, gpu accelerated, etc.)
 regenerate chunks of text
 edit generated messages
 inserts own sections of text
 includes or excludes chunks of text with a checkbox for the generation of the next text
  
Those features are probably heavily inspired by character.ai, and based on my very limited experience with gpt-neo-1.3B.
 I'm thinking about starting such a project, but my time is very limited due to my other projects already.
 Are there other developers with angular / react / python flask / tensorflow / pytorch / huggingface experience?

This is a TUI app which displays interactive Markdown documents. Interactive in the sense that you can scroll code fences / tables / and click links. There's a Table of Contents extracted from the MD, and a very rudimentary browser like forward + back.
I'm thinking it could be the starting point for a variety of hypertext like applications in the terminal.
Very much a work in progress.

 Currently I am researching extreme learning machines, and - after I calculated the beta weights - I would like to optimize the alpha weights (similarly with the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse) in order to receive better accuracy.
 During this backward calculation, I use the inverse of the previously applied activation function. In case of the inverse sigmoid and tanh (logit and arctan), I receive NaN values, although with the inverse leaky ReLU, on certain datasets, the method yields better accuracy. Unfortunately, in most cases, the accuracy drops (sometimes significantly) with these new optimized alpha weights. What do you think, what is the reason for this?

 how long would it take a swimmer to circle the Earth? 
 It basically just divived the length of the equatir by the speed of an average swimmer.....WTF!
 I know the question is difficult to answer, but a little more sophistication would be in order

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I first asked the chatbot (ChatGPT by Openai) to "Prove the Collatz conjecture" straightforwardly and nothing meaningful came out except what it is and how unproven it is. This was its conclusion: "Despite these efforts, the conjecture remains unsolved. It is considered to be one of the most challenging and intriguing unsolved problems in mathematics."
 Then I proceeded with "try to solve it" & then "use another method that no one used before to solve it" with no worthy answer.
 I figured that these cheap shots weren't gonna do it, so I worked around the question and proceeded with this:
 "3n+1 where n is a positive integer n/2 where n is a non-negative integer. Prove the answer end by cycling through 1,4,2,1,4,2,1,… if n is a positive integer. This is a repetitive process and you will rep…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi community! I am a senior in college with Mathematics major. I am based in NYC. I have an avid internet in pursuing a career in Data Science. In the past I have participated in a year long data science fellowship run by my University. I have also participated in a Data Science summer school run by a major technology company. I have been persistently applying to related roles but I haven’t had offers or fair amount of interviews either (I am in a student visa currently). Most of the Data Science jobs ask for at least Master’s degree or fair amount of years of experience. Now my concern is that if I should pursue a MS in Data Science.

 I'm supposed to load in large .txt files, each file should be split into shorter parts consisting of 10 words each, they are then put into my data frame with each word being put into one of 10 columns. 
 The problem is that my code is slow, like really slow. It takes around 20 minutes to load the first 100000 rows of text into my dataframe, which is less than 1% of my data. I have also noticed that code slows down the further it takes to run, it takes about a second to load in the first 3000 rows, and 15 seconds for the first 10000 rows.
