        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any other mid career DS out there job hunting? How’s it going for you? Best wishes to anyone else caught up in layoffs or job insecurity!
 I have 7.5+ yrs of DS experience, and was laid off after not opting into Twitter 2.0 in November. I spent >3 years at Twitter, and it was honestly one of the most rewarding jobs of my career. I loved the people I worked with, I loved the domain I was in and it was one of the most “impactful” roles I’ve ever had. It was definitely a mindf*ck to watch the acquisition in person and see everything I’d worked on basically get thrown out the window (and to see so many amazingly talented colleagues tossed out and/or disrespected). I spent the last few months recharging, relaxing and processing everything.
 Now that I’m back on the job market, I’m revisiting all of my old interviewing and imposter syndrome anxieties. I’ve always gotten excellent feedback and performance reviews and know I was a highly valued member of my team. And it’s pretty satisfying to have so much experience under my belt this time around. But with the weird job market and so many other tech layoffs (and knowing that everyone I worked with at Twitter is also actively on the market) I am second guessing everything. I have also only applied to a handful of roles because not many openings have caught my interest. On one hand I want to wait to see if the job market improves later in the year, but I’m also stressed about not having much to say for myself when asked about my job search. 
 I also get flustered after talking to people who say things like, “oh your field is so hot you should have multiple offers within days!” Fortunately my partner is very supportive, and I’m generally able to talk myself back to a good place. Today was just one of those rough days when my anxiety really spiked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BLUF: What is the number of interview cycles you typically conduct at the same time while being able to make a good impression? 
 I find the data science interview process a bit like having a second job. The questions span a huge breadth of topics but also often cover those topics in depth. In my role, I'll usually be focused on one type of problem at a time, but in an interview, I will go from live coding advanced data manipulation questions to deriving gradient descent, calculating confidence intervals, and demonstrating business acumen in the course of an hour. The interviews are usually multiple rounds and take up my entire afternoon and weekends studying/interviewing.
 That said, there is a lot of overlap between topics I need to study for interviews from different companies, and it helps to have competing offers. I would like to know, what is the number of interview cycles you typically conduct around the same time while being able to make a good impression? There is definitely a balance between spreading yourself too thin and putting all that effort into a single role that you're competing for, I just haven't found it yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The title. 
 I've been in my position for close to a year now and it feels like our data is so criminally bad that it's hard to actually predict or infer anything. I know a majority of the time doing the job is data prep and cleaning, but sometimes it feels like that's all I do and still yield no results. 
 Even when it's around time to actually start modeling, I have to understand that there is a decent chance my training data is just plain misleading.
 Anyone have any horror stories? Or find themselves in a similar circumstance? Maybe this is just a "grass is always greener on the other side" scenario.

 ​
 1) “we re-oriented the company around AI six years ago”
 Right off the bat, “Pich-AI” lets it be known that Google is now an AI company. 
 Partially true? Yes, of course. 
 Would that phrase be coming out of his mouth at this point if not for the release and success of ChatGPT? No. 
 2) their mission: “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”
 There’s a book called The Innovator’s Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail. 
 I'm certainly not here to say that Google is going to fail, but the re-stating of the mission makes it clear that they view AI (and Bard) as a way to improve, supplement, and perhaps protect their search business. This is …]]></summary>

My degree was in accounting. I’m trying to change my last rotation to a business analyst in the technology department to stack up some experience. How can I pivot more towards machine learning data science ? Besides learning tableau, Python, R, SQL. Would a MS in CS benefit to go into a fin tech company? 
 I went to a community college for my bachelors in accounting, I believe a MS in CS would help with foundational knowledge and marketability. 
 I appreciate any advice!

FlappyBirdle combines elements from the game Flappy Bird and the popular word game Wordle. I wanted to see if I could make a game that added urgency to Wordle, while also feeling outragous at the same time. I think I achieved it with FlappyBirdle. Every time you type a letter of the word, the bird flaps its wings and you get closer to the goal. It also has an easy mode that ignores the pipes, so even beginners can get a good score. Let me know if you have any ideas on how I can make it better!

 I one hot encoded a categorical variable with 26 categories.
 I have a binary target variable I am trying to predict.
 This target variable is very rare: 1 in 200.
 Particular categories have the target variable equal to 1 0.13% of the time, and other categories are only 0.3% of the time.
 I'm trying to assess if these differences are statistically significant across all of the categories.
 Does anyone know what hypothesis test this would be?
 Edit: I've tried the chi square contingency test. Got a p value of 0. Don't particularly trust the results.

Next to that I can make websites using Sveltekit so for smaller companies/ startups I can help start them up in the digital world. But that is a bit out of the question I want to make in this post. But maybe it connects the topics a bit in form of web analytics.
 In what area's of digital marketing can data science be beneficial for smaller/ local companies as a service? I am continuously thinking of analytics being more applicable in this case.. Does anyone have any sources that I can read through that touch on this subject? I am also happy to hear your opinion on this.

 The two major options I see:
  
You believe consciousness arises from a very complicated system of biology > cells > molecules > atoms > elements. Ultimately a mechanistic view that, metaphorically, life is complicated machinery.
 
If not the former, then it seems the only other major option is that life is somehow endowed some supernatural or divine force that humans could never synthetically replicate. This is of course generally considered a spiritual/religious belief.
 
 So if you believe in item 1, doesn't this mean you pretty much have to believe that AI is or can have consciousness?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Redditors! 
 Upon searching for methods to find errors within tabular data, I wasn't able to find much so I decided to write my own notebook and article.
 In the article, I outline the necessity for data-centric techniques and how you are able to get model-agnostic improvement by improving the quality of your data. Not only does this improve model performance by itself, but it also leaves additional room for the usual model improvements (hyperparameter tuning, architecture optimization, etc).
 I go into more detail in the article, but at a high level I:
  
Trained the baseline xgboost model on the original data (67% accuracy)
 Used data-centric techniques (cleanlab) to find label issues within the dataset
 Dropped the incorrect data from the training set
 Retrained the same XGBoost model on the better-quality data (90% accuracy)
  
In doing this, I was able to see a reduction in error of 70%. The raw increase in classification accuracy went from 67% to 90%.
 I hope this will be of value to those working with tabular data and machine learning. Check out the blog and let me know your thoughts in the comments!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On LinkedIn I see more and more people labeling them as data scientists, AI experts and what-not offering paid courses, interview training and resume review. Often, they have a non-data-science background and very little experience working as a professional. Quite common to show a previous job as a data scientist with a tenure less than 1 year (or multiple).
 I know it can be appealing, as their message is often, everyone can be a data scientist, machine learning engineer or AI expert. Academic and professional degrees are overrated and it’s enough to take a Udemy or Coursera course to become a data scientist (affiliate link included). Simply follow them and buy their resources (which is usually very general advice, you can google in a few minutes).
 But the reality is: They are usually not the experts they pretend to be. They typically don’t talk about expert topics, they talk about career, current hypes, and about very high-level projects. Sometimes they have a GitHub account, but they have no commits of just copy-pasted repositories from other people and some very basic entry-level stuff. They are usually on LinkedIn, Instagram, and YouTube and in podcasts, but never talking about expert topics.
 Don’t trust these people and don’t buy courses there. Everything you need is either free of charge or it’s a professional degree. There is no easy-going way to become an expert in any topic. The only good advice these people can give is how to become a fake AI influencer. 
 If you are looking for good advice, look for experts with a clear professional track record (several years), academic publications or talks at industry conferences and articles/blogposts about specific expert topics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[7 years ago I posted here on reddit about a writing software I've developed. People have been giving me lots of positive feedback and I've been using it myself so I decided to upgrade it and make it into a web application and incorporating AI-assistance features into it, see link, screenshot and video below.
 Link: Storycraft 
 Screenshot
 Video
 It's a writing tool that serves a certain writing process where you can structure and break the story down from top to bottom, similar to the snowflake method. The app makes it easy to create and navigate your story structure - acts, chapters and scenes. It allows you to create notes that you attach to these sections, and keep them separate from the text.
 It features basic AI-assistance features, that I personally found very helpful in my writing.
 It's free, unless you want to use the AI-assistance features which are currently available to try out for free, but will require a subscription if you want to keep using it.
 I hope you find my upgraded writing tool useful and I'm open to any feedback or suggestions you may have.

 Characters as shown on https://chatfai.com/characters/
 Hi everyone!
 I have recently made some exciting changes to my ChatFAI web app.
  
The public characters library is now live - it's now easy to share and install public characters.
 Added a regenerate reply option.
 Created a new plan without any daily limit.
  
I have gotten a lot of help and support from this community. The feedback and support from you all are really helpful and that is how I am improving ChatFAI (based on the feedback and suggestions).
 So, here I am again. What do you think about the latest updates? Is it going in the right direction?
 Another challenge I have not resolved yet is finding B2B use cases for ChatFAI.
 Thank you for your help and support - it's greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a data set that is comprised of 6000 data points of performance ratings. Performance ratings are on a uniform rating scale of 1 (unsatisfactory) to 4 (highest possible outcome). 
 The # of ratings a manager can make depends on the number of employees they supervise. 
 The number of supervisees for each manager can range from 1 employee to 20 employees. 
 I would like to analyze manager performance ratings of their supervises to look for harsh raters (to many 1s) vs. easy ratings (too many 4s) . There are a number of other factors that may contribute to the overall scoring for example - tenure, job profile, etc. 
 Technically employees end up with 1/2/3/4. However, prior to that you can have values in-between. 
 To get more detailed: 
 25% of the overall dating is based on 4 categories which people are rated from 1-4 for each category. 
 75% of the overall rating is goal achievement. The # of goals are variable. Each goal outcome is rated on 1-4. 
 Technically, you can have a score of 2.6 or 3.1 or 3.8. they follow typical convention of rounding up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was recently in an interview for a data scientist role and I was explaining how I’d used a logistic regression to predict a binary outcome variable from a continuous, numerical variable.
 I got asked how I’d communicate this with non-specialists, and I talked about putting together a simple set of slides in PowerPoint, with key points, omitting the unnecessary technical details (formulae etc.).
 The follow-up question stumped me though. They asked me how I’d explain the “glm” function (in R) to the same audience - for reference, this is the function used to fit the model to my training data which solves for the coefficients. This stumped me as I hadn’t thought about how to do this. All I could think about was making an analogy with linear regression - in that we’re finding the slope and intercept of a “best fit” line - and that here we’re sort of doing the same?
 Does anyone know how they might have approached that?

 I have a solid foundation of math and stats. I understand the math behind ML. I've built some simple models in sklearn. I've created kpis and visualizations in python. But goodness, I feel so insanely overwhelmed by the tech stack.
 SQL, python, golang, ruby, tensorflow, pyspark, pytorch, nlp, the list goes on...
 I'm an expert at all types of SQL and decent at python and some libraries like sklearn/pyspark etc.
 I can't help but feel like I can never reach the potential of all you kaggle grandmasters, Nvidia DS, phds and all this jazz. I'm competing with jobs where my other competition has an ivy league degree and probably a PhD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 this idea was originally mentioned in this post w.r.t mock interviews, and a few people thought it was a worth trying and agreed to participate already. so i'm creating this post to gather few interested folks to test it out (as well as feedback).
 The basic idea is to provide a (free) volunteer-led service for mock interviews and interviewing tips from folks with a few years in the field and potentially also discussions with managers sharing their experience transitioning into management, hearing how DS operates across different industries etc. (the latter 2 are my selfish inclusions as I would love to hear about more companies, more career stories and more DS work across industries, but understand the demand will be mostly for the first 2). 
 This sub is great for transient questions and discussions, and there is still room for 'spotlight' talks and personalized mentorship and better networking based on the ideas above. 
 few strategies to make this work:
  
start simple. with a small cohort of people across different stages in their career
 every participant can mentor someone junior to them, for load sharing. also works well for more time-relevant advice like interview trends etc
 
some kind of testimonial system so that mentors also receive credit for their service to the community. 
 the no of members will decrease with seniority but that's also ok since senior DS advice is generally career advice relevant to wider group (vs interview tips/company culture etc)
 medium of communication - not sure but async would be preferred to avoid scheduling overhead, interviews/talks can be scheduled and recorded. 
  
there is a survey below for folks interested to fill out. and volunteers interested in helping planning and executing, please also reach out :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I recently screwed up a couple of interviews because of not doing as well as I should have on ML System Design/Case Study type questions where interviewers generally give very vague broad questions. I would love to know the kind of framework people follow for it and any material you used to prep for that? Any good articles/books/youtube channels with good content around this would be appreciated. thanks!
 Edit: The kind of questions I'm talking about:
  
Consider you have a software and documentation for that software. You want to give your users the opportunity to ask the software to complete tasks or get help. How would you think about this?
 
Consider you are working with a hospital. Their ICU is overloaded with patients and they want to prioritize who the doctors should look at first. How would you go about building an ML system for this?
