        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, for context I am a new DS masters student with background in computer engineering and I wanted to try and make a project for comparing a foto of an ID card like the student card with a picture of the person to see if they match, but since I don't have any dataset with student cards and their faces, my questions are:
  
Is it possible to create a decent solution for this using pre-trained models and taking advantage of transfer learning?
 How would you approach this problem?
  
Thank you in advance for any help/advice!

There was a discussion on HN a few weeks ago about how a developer shaved off almost half of their native app's code without losing functionality [1]. Our launch today is a direct outcome of that thread and, moreso, in the context of this comment [2] and this one [3]. Paraphrasing the context below:

People saying that it's stealing, "not real art," "not real artists," lazy, dystopian, evil, and just downright immoral.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there any advantage to using the native scala api to write production code for Apache Spark or does pyspark work just as well? 
 I’ve been learning a bit of scala the past few weeks and am really enjoying it but from what I gather, the language doesn’t seem to have much of a foothold in the data science/data engineering space, even among Spark users.
 Just wondering if there’s any practical benefit to continuing down this path or if it’s a complete waste of time. I’m getting kind of bored with python and really just want something new to explore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read a lot of opinions and complaining about data lakes on the net. I don't fully understand what a data lake is - or a warehouse for that matter as I haven't worked with one yet. But my question is are they actually useful and if so - why are people complaining?
 Are people complaining about data lakes because theirs is badly implemented and/or badly understood and/or badly integrated in the day-to-day work? Or are they complaining because as a concept ("just chuck everything in the same place and forget about it. Maybe someone will find a use later ") data lakes are a suboptimal workaround that doesn't address a companies actual data problems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am a Data Analyst and trying to gain a basic understanding of Apache Spark and have been stuck on some technical definitions of this framework, particularly its most advanced technique: distributed computing. 
 As PySpark is introduced as a better solution for large datasets over Pandas (as it runs on 1 computer), if I execute a script, where is it running on actually? I only have one PC, what distributed computers in this case means? 
 I need some English explanations for this topic as all I google out were technical terms.

 I have zero experience in programming, I just started to learn Python few days ago (not really necessary as I will learn it anyways as part of my course in a couple of months along with a few other data science modules, but I think earlier I learn Python more time I will have to make projects and move on to learning other stuff). As a student with no background in programming and who is not studying computer science, what tips would you give me to be prepared for data science internship? I am hoping to be able to get internships by end of summer of my second year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm a researcher using fMRI to study the brain. I was wondering if there were any neat methods to perform a more large-scale and interaction-based analysis of the brain response. For example, I have many areas that respond to stimulation and at first, I used to make a scatterplot showing the response ratio of one area to another, but I want to expand this to many others to find a possible trend or interaction effect between areas. For example, some show horrible response in one area, but response in another is good. (I get confused if I should exclude this sample or if some interaction effect is occuring). The ideal goal would be to predict all other area's responses based on one or two area's response. I hope this makes sense and would appreciate data scientist's expertise. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering if people have thoughts on C/C++ as a first low,level language for a data scientist/machine learning engineer.
 I've been using R and Python for over half a decade now but have yet to learn a low level language.
 I've used Cython for some projects, but without any real knowledge of C or C++. I've never tried out something like rcpp (I'm an opportunistic R user primarily).
 I've run into some points in the past where it would have been helpful to avoid Python/R entirely (except for maybe a CLI wrapper tool).
 I'd like to pick up one or the other, but I'm not sure which is a better choice. Right now my application is mostly theoretical, so it's a skill building exercise
 I have a few thoughts about advantages at disadvantages. These obviously aren't facts, just leanings/concept…]]></summary>

The thing is the job is a 6 month contract and while they have a very strong history of hiring contact employees, in the interview i asked what the odds were of me being hired and he said he couldn’t have a solid answer and that the budget is decided in the new year and it was out of his hands. He made it clear that he was very interested in having me become a full time employee. 
 Another thing he mentioned that kind of through me off was he was suprised about the fact that i had a full time job and wasn’t currently doing contract work. He then said “i shouldn’t really be saying this but as a friend i would be hesitant about leaving a full time job for a contract esp bc he cannot gaurentee me full time and that with the way the economy is going it could be risky”
 Would love if anyone would like to weigh in. I like my job now but this raise would be great and the company is a fairly big one that i would love to be at. I’m fairly early in my career with only 2+ years of experience. Wondering what the job market would be like in the event of a crash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No human can catch up with all the papers published on one day in academic journals and no single human has a detailed overview of all scientific findings that have ever been published. So there may already be scientific findings by a lot of different scientists that can be put together to find a solution to a problem that we have. But no single scientist is aware of all of these findings, because the amount of information is just too big. Even if they collaborate and exchange knowledge, that is still only a tiny part of all the research ever published.
 If we trained an AI on say the whole PubMed database, would it be possible that the AI could come up with ways to treat diseases that we are currently not able to treat?
 I guess, it is probably not possible, but I was just having this idea so I thought I'd share it

Apparently, the software is already there and people immitate voices convincingly using just audio samples of someone talking, and I wonder how I can test that myself. I downloaded this GitHub project, and it works relatively well on the provided samples, but it doesn't work on random recordings from YouTube. Is there any free service I can use to clone voices and use them in text to speech? It wouldn't even matter how much data was required, I'd be willing to download hunderts of hours of YouTube videos and feed it to the AI, if the results were promising.

 I'm naive to most stuff in the private sector, but what's impetus for this? I assume it's departments trying to justify their budgets for the next year, but the grand majority of these roles are contract gigs via third parties (which I dismiss out of hand, since I'm already FTE).

 I want to use for videos a very specific voice I've heard a lot but don't know the name of.
 It is a British accent voice and used frequently in YouTube videos, but the only place I found it on was this website: British English Text to Speech | Play.ht where it called it "Logan". When I looked up that name I couldn't find any other websites for it. This website was particularly bad for my purposes, it wants me to pay $15 a month for more than 5 bits of AI voice a day, I can spare to lose a little money but I'm not paying that just for one voice.
 This website was much nicer: Uberduck - Make cool stuff with AI and text to speech , but I couldn't find any generic voices on it, and not the one I wanted
 Does anyone have any suggestions?

 https://tech-lagoon.com/imagechef/en/image-to-comic.html?reloaded=true
 I like this feature of turning image into manga style black and white/screentone, i have tried many alternative other than this website, but so far this one is the best i have ever seen.
 the problem is, the web is kind of buggy and sluggish, the function sometimes works, sometimes doesnt. when i try to contact the web owner, the contact form is broken, thus im unable to contact the web master.
 my question is, do you guys have any AI alternative that can produce manga style image from a picture just as good as this that i can run locally in my own machine ? 
 really appreciated if you guys can help me point to the right direction 
 best regards

 Are there any good guides (udemy courses work) on dealing with semi-structured data in snowflake? Performance tradeoffs? Tricks? Should I plan on writing tons of UDFs?
 One thing I'm curious about is filtering one array based on some criteria in another identically sized array? Can I get an array of results easily or an array of indices?e.g. find all items where date is >= 1-3-20
 dates = ['1-1-20', '1-2-20', '1-3-20', '1-5-20']items = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
 desire is to return ['c', 'd'] (or [2, 3]/[3, 4] depending on how you index so it can be passed into other things)

 I've done obvious things like check basic documentation and google...

 I did not do any EDA or FE, because it’s only numpy arrays, without any description on features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So basically as the title says, I signed my very first internship in a DS startup. They were really impressed with me but couldnt offer me full time job as the startup is underfunded but offered me 2 months testing internship (3 days/wk ,payed hourly) and then the option to sign full time job after.
 In general the past week was my first week. I REALLY like the job, the data, the location, the people, basically everything. 
 My only problem is I have a bit of imposter syndrome. Until now I only did Kaggle notebooks and the rapid change to production enviornment stresses me out a bit. I get lost in masses of codes and directories. Also the data is much bigger than what I used to deal with. My internship is basically improving one of their models. The past week I spent most of it trying to figure out the code and also did a lot of my version of feature engineering but they want next week to apply it to production already and its kinda stressing me out a bit that Im slow and wasting their time (I wouldnt have had problem if it was a big coorporation, but its a fairly early small underfunded startup as said so every dollar counts and I do want to give value for the money they spent on me even if they dont continue with me).
 I wanted to ask you guys if you have any tips on how to succeed in this internship and how to make the shift from kaggle-notebooks code to production enviornment? I know I can do this I just need to get a grip of myself asap.
 Highly appreciate your help!

 Hands and eyes are often misplaced, misshapen, or grotesque. I think we're a generation or two away from hands and eyes being resolved. I know that Google has upgraded their systems (more parameters and more tokens) to fix this issue but due to the pending legal battles for these AI art models they've never released those models to the public.
 In order to get an acceptable result it sometimes requires a few generations / variations which makes OpenAI's pricing model hard to stomach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you vet open-source dependencies’ security? For me, I feel comfortable when
 1.) I’ve heard of the package before amongst colleagues or well-regarded DSs/developers. 2.) When my package manager can install it easily- i.e. install.packages in R or pip install or better yet conda install in Python.
 When I feel uncomfortable- when both of the above are FALSE, especially if that package is coming from directly from GitHub or BitBucket. When only one is FALSE is somewhat of a gray area. I know for a fact that there have been malicious packages discovered on PyPi. Idk about packages on CRAN or conda.
 How does your system or thought process compare to mine? What are some other good security measures? Any mailing lists when something malicious is discovered? Automated checks in package managers? Any tips beyond what I laid out in 1.) and 2.) 
 To my knowledge, no program really emphasizes this as part of its training. Yet, we all encounter it. I get that in some organizations, this may be “somebody else’s job” but eventually we all encounter it at some level, at a minimum on your personal machine. What organizational structures do this the best? If this is “someone else’s job” in your org, is it too bureaucratic? Can you even get a hold of sed person? How does this person even do that job?

The first year at my job I had quite some projects which also helped me improving my skills concerning DS related subjects. However, the year after that it kinda collapsed at work. For a while that okay, because mentally it did not go well with me. However, now it’s going better with me and I need challenge. I am really afraid that all the skills I gained will go away and that my study and work was for nothing. Data, and especially data science is new in my organization. The projects they have is simple analyses and nothing challenging. What should I do? And how can I keep up with my DS skills?
