 Bought a legion 7i but I think the tasks I need to do require more than a mobile gpu. Plus the battery is awful. 
 So for building a desktop gpu workstation:
  
How important is nvlink or sli for scaling. Can PCI bus achieve the same using nvidia NCCL for scaling vram and cores in multiple gpus for bigger datasets? 
 
If so, can I go with cheaper cards like 3060 12GB, and get 3-4 of them? How to determine a motherboard that can host multiple GPUs (not talking about multi gpu support plugs like nvlink sli etc)
 
How much ram, processor should I aim for let's say if my work is mostly in machine learning, scientific Computation using rapids, pycuda, numba etc, molecular modeling, and not just deep learning and neural networks.
 
Also how feasible are such desktops to use as remote servers. Say I wanted to use them at home but not necessarily in the same room, but via my light laptop. 
 
 Will appreciate a ton.

 30M here.
 I did a Masters in Industrial Engineering with a focus in Data Science from 2018-2020. During grad school, I studied and prepped really hard to break into Data Science and accrued some good learnings/projects. Since I came from a Manufacturing Engineering background, I was offered a Manufacturing Engineering role from a Bay area EV startup, and I accepted it at the time. I was an international student and the company and pay was good for me at the time.
 2 years into Manufacturing Engineering and I feel deeply dissatisfied with my current job and future trajectory and wish to get back into DS. From what I have seen usually, many Hiring Managers tend to be really narrow visioned sometimes to give a person from other field a shot.
 How can I best improve my odds so that I can get into DS. I am ready to slog or do whatever it takes except for going back to school for another degree.

 What program/programs should I be using to do this properly?
 Im currently using google sheets, but I am running into so many little stupid issues, like not being able to sort a pivot table or delete rows or columns in a pivot table i have no idea why.
 Should i be using python for this? I do know how to code, but I just haven't gone through the steps to compare separate data sets like I'm trying to do.
 My end goal is to create a line graph with some kind of numbers for each country, with each line being a different aspect. Government Corruption, Happiness, Education, GDP Growth, and Foreign Investment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a problem where I have two texts T1, T2. T1 contains some important points that I have entered. How can I make sure that T2 has those points? I am aware of the algorithms like cosine, jaccard, BERT for semantic similarity but the problem is that they apply to the whole text whereas I want point-wise similarity i.e. T2 must contain the T1 points although the order and words used may differ a bit.
 ​
 By points I meant bullet points covering discrete concepts and I basically want to check how many discrete concepts in my T1's points are covered in T2 where they could be in a single sentence or spread out across multiple sentences.
 ​
 Example:
 So T1 could have the following two points:
 - The Queen reigned from 1952 to 2022.
 - The Queen was the second longest reigning monarch.
 ​
 Now T2 could either be:
 The Queen was the second longest reigning monarch with her reign spanning 1943 to 2022.
 or
 - The Queen reigned from 1952 to 2022.
 - She was Britain's second longest monarch.
 In both these cases, T2 should be considered to contain both points in T1.

 I'm a budding data scientist - who has almost completed my Master in Data Science, as well as done some Azure certifications. I feel pretty competent with Python and R (and various important libraries/packages of those languages) at the moment - but am always learning new things, and have recently started learning SQL, which my degree didn't really focus on much, through Datacamp.

Are you still active in any social media platforms?
Stop writing Twitter threads
Three things to like about the Fediverse
For what it’s worth, I did enjoy reading both of these threads—but I also recognize that the culture of lobste.rs is formed primarily from users who have been around much longer than I have. If these posts are indeed off-topic, should they be removed? If they are on-topic, should a new tag (social-media) be added? Given that a large amount of users are flagging these stories, there is a strong case for wanting to filter them out. A disclaimer would probably need to be added (similar to merkle-trees), stating something along the lines of non-technical discussions on social media or general business news of social media is not allowed.
I double-checked the about page, and although many things are explicitly off-topic, social media is not mentioned:
entrepreneurship, management, news about companies that employ a lot of programmers, investing, world events, anthropology, self-help, personal productivity systems, last-resort customer service requests via public shaming, “I wanted to see what this site’s amazing users think about this off-topic thing”, and defining the single morally correct economic and political system for the entire world when we can’t even settle tabs vs. spaces.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I am thinking taking switching my career to a government contract agency. There are a couple of things I want to consider and hoping someone working as a data scientist in a government contract past/current could give me insight. 
 1) salary progression:
 I couldn't find good numbers on this except for individual company salaries such as Lockheed Martin pays data scientists(0-1 year) 107K compared to 108K which is the national average (glassdoor). how does the salary of a data scientist with Confidential security clearance in a government contract agency compare to those that don't do government contracting?
 2) thing on the work.
 I came to data science from a statistics background but I soon realized that data scientist work involves very simple statistics for many different reasons (some good and some bad). The government hires a lot of statisticians so does data science work in government contracting involves more statistics (more than making KPI dashboards). I could like to keep up with modern tech stacks like working with data lakes,AWS, is that too much to ask?
 3)work-life balance and management 
 pretty simple how much do you work in a week and who do you report to? Also how many people are you working with?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, so I'm not a CS nor DS major, so please help me to understand if I'm wrong.
 Apparently, there were 3 V's originally (later they added other V's), but "Velocity" was there from the beginning.
 But according to the definition from Physics, "speed denotes only how fast an object is moving, whereas velocity describes both how fast and in which direction the object is moving. If a car is said to travel at 60 km/h, its speed has been specified. However, if the car is said to move at 60 km/h to the north, its velocity has now been specified".
 But data doesn't have any direction, does it? You can't say the terms "uploading" and "downloading" are supposed to mean the direction here, because when it comes to data-mining and data-processing (what big data is all about), it is always only about downloading, isn't it? When describing data, we can only specify the speed at which new data is coming, e.g. 1000 new data points are recorded every second, for example.
 I assume, those who came up with the 3 V's (or 4 V's, or 5 V's, or whichever V's), decided to use the word "velocity" (instead of "speed") although it's technically not correct, only because "speed" would ruin the mnemonic.
 Am I wrong?

I'm looking to enter the public sector as a public policy analyst, and data science is considered (at my public policy school) the future of public policy analysis. However, I assume that most data science advice I can read/find/listen to is geared more toward private sector careers. So I'm wondering how to modulate my understanding of that kind of advice given that I'm only interested in public sector work. What kinds of work really gets done? What tools get used? What kinds of qualifications do people tend to have? What programs/hard skills do people actually get to use? 
 And ... does anyone listen to anything the data people say?

 I typically would just learn on youtube, github, stackoverflow etc but am considering making a more intentional and full time shift. I learn fine online but am considering an IRL program to fully immerse and dedicate 1-2 years of my time to it. So IRL or online courses?? Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[so, I have this college project (image processing project) through which I was required to make a face recognition code using python without using any library which is related to (AI, machine learning, deep learning, etc...), it has to be all about image processing.
 ​
 my professor said that before 2010, there was not that much use of AI to do face recognition. so face recognition was made by some image processing algorithms, I am required to implement a face recognition algorithm using these old methods. but when I searched on google, most of the GitHub repos or algorithms on Google are using some libraries based on AI (like OpenCV, tensor flow, etc...).
 ​
 so I was wondering if anyone could guide me to one of these old references or scientific papers or a GitHub repo for guidance and for implementing my programs.
 any help would be appreciated, thanks in advance.

 If you're asked to do a 10 hour take-home assignment, tell them no.
 If you're asked to do some brain-teaser questions and/or probability-esque calculations in a live setting, tell them no.
 If they ghosted you for 4 weeks and then all of a sudden pretend to be interested in your candidacy, tell them no.
 If they refuse to be upfront about salary, unwilling to provide even a reasonably sized range, tell them no.
 I completely realize not everyone is in the lucky position to be picky. But if you are, use that to send a signal to recruiters that the practices they're using are very often completely ridiculous.

I'm curious what this community's favorites are for latent dirichlet allocation that don't force me to read 95 pages of academia-ese.
 I'm particularly interested in actual applications too, so if you use it in your job, I'd really most especially love to hear about that. I did my fair share of googling and was fairly disappointed, so I thought I'd post and see what this subreddit's thoughts are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN! We’re building an open-source pricing & packaging engine for SaaS with a built-in billing system. (https://github.com/uselotus/lotus).
We strongly believe pricing is the largest untapped growth lever for SaaS, primarily because pricing affects so many critical systems that don’t talk to each other (billing, payments, feature limits, metering, and CRM). We’re building this infrastructure to fix this and enable quick experimentation.
Lotus acts as a central repository for all of your pricing plans and utilizes your payment gateway, to manage usage-based, per-seat, and custom enterprise pricing. We’re excited to open-source this because we want to enable developers to build their custom pricing and integration edge cases on top of this base.
We’ve launched this repo under an MIT license so any developer can use the tool. Give it a spin for us at either:
* test our cloud version at (https://demo.uselotus.io)
* self-host here (https://github.com/uselotus/lotus) 
and let us know what you think.
All feedback is appreciated! If the project is especially relevant to you, follow us and we’ll keep you updated when we’ve fully published all our beta features.

I still have a lot of things I want to build, but now seemed like a good time to put it out there: even if the results aren’t nearly the quality I’d like, I’ve still found it useful and I want to show it off!
I’ve been working on it since September 2021, but only in fits and starts. The entire thing runs on a computer in my living room (there’s a picture on the About page); I haven’t done any load testing so we’ll see how it holds up.

Linkedin become a mess of self-promotion and some long stories with lots of likes but no points given - I deleted my Linkedin. Quora more and more getting bad content, the reason, the people I was there for no longer be there.
Most of the time I always found myself bored and end up in scrolling down facebook/instagram/youtube reels for hours with no purpose - maybe to just to kill the time.
Considering delete all my accounts, maybe except Twitter - where some people I follow still posting.
What about you? Are you still active in any social media platforms? What else beside these social media platforms and what do you think will be next after no one else using these platforms?]]></summary>
