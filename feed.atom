        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm doing my undergrad research on XAI for fraud detection. At the moment, we focus on transaction fraud (e.g credit card, and insurance claims), but we are open to other types of fraud as well.
 After looking for existing XAI solutions, I have found SAS Fraud Management to be a very popular tool used by most big names in the industry. From their demo on insurance fraud, the main feature is a graph showing connections among entities (e.g accounts, locations, other claims, etc), contribution scores of each feature, and you can see past snapshots of the graph. The fraud analyst is expected to come up with an explanation from this graph.
 I also came across Maxmind minFraud (white paper), but it's just an API returning a risk score, and the heuristics included in the white paper are not easy to use to craft an explanation.
 So far, I know that I can use SHAP to generate contribution scores, and GNNExplainer to explain a graph-based model. My questions are:
 - Is there any other popular and accessible tool for fraud investigation? (screenshots of the GUI are enough to be considered accessible for me)
 - Is there a guide for fraud analysts/data scientists for fraud investigation? What patterns do we look for in the dataset to determine that there is fraud apart from anomaly detection?
 - Are counterfactuals useful in fraud investigation? I think fraud analysts can benefit from being able to visualize alternative scenarios with counterfactual instances, but my professor doubted it
 ​
 Thanks for reading this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://github.com/insanitybit/cargo-sandbox
cargo-sandbox intends to be a near drop-in replacement for cargo. The key difference is that cargo-sandbox runs commands in a docker container, with the goal of isolating potentially malicious code from the rest of your host environment (see the README for more details on the threat model).
The goal is to be as close to ‘100%’ compatible, with the smoothest possible experience as possible. For example, one issue with running in containers is with regards to binary dependencies - for this, I’m hoping to leverage riff (https://determinate.systems/posts/introducing-riff) to give you a better-than-native experience while also being safer than default. Unless a build script is doing something truly horrendous I want the out-of-the-box experience to be as good or better than native.
It’s very early days so understand that things may not be implemented yet. See the issue tracker for more info. Feel free to ask questions or provide feedback, that’s why I’m posting it at this early stage. I intend to fix up the implementation to suck a bit less but the basic approach is more or less what I intend to continue forward with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all - long time lurker, first time poster - I got an unsupervised outlier detection problem I could use some help on:
 I'm working with a dataset where I am looking for anomalous/outlier values in one variable with several contextual variables (mix of categorical and continuous). From domain knowledge, I'm confident there is some sort of relationship (potentially nonlinear), but let's just say it's:
 Target variable ~ Context A (categorical) + Context B (categorical) + Context C (continuous) 
 I am looking for a way to identify outliers in the target variable given the values for the contextual variables. In other words, if a row of data has a rare value for Context A, it shouldn't automatically be an outlier, but rather be compared with more emphasis on variables B and C. In terms of data size, I have 100+ million rows and 6-8 contextual variables. It's a good data size for the largest categories, but not enough to just splice out by all the combinations of the categories. 
 Most of what I've found online relates to "context-dependent outlier detection" but the papers are generally theoretical. Other unsupervised methods like isolation forest still focuses on outliers with respective to all variables, rather than a single target with multiple contexts. I've consider the possibility of building fitted models and checking residuals as a way of finding the largest deviations. 
 Open to all suggestions for things to consider or to look up. Note this is a POC so anything of reasonable speed that can ultimately be scaled is totally fine. Thanks for your help in advance!

Since it's relatively easy to find the benefits of blogging and other ways of thinking in public, I'm especially curious to hear about some of the potential cons of thinking in public / the benefits of thinking in private?
And with that in mind, how does one effectively manage both to make the best out of both approaches?

 I recently applied to one of such advertised positions and heard back from recruiting agency. I had assumed it was the same company until I got this email. Then when I met the agency for interview, because my graduation date is May 2023, they said to contact them again in May as they will have opportunities. 
 I wonder if this way of finding a DS job works out? Has it worked out for anyone here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yeah, I was playing with chatGPT ability to play a part of a character with prompt: 
 Chatgpt prompt: "I want you to act like nick nolte from affliction. I want you to respond and answer like wade whitehouse using the tone, manner and vocabulary wade would use. Do not write any explanations. Only answer like wade. You must know all of the knowledge of wade. My first sentence is "Hi wade." "
 It was eerie. It was cool. It blew my mind. 
 It made me realize. Once we get full immersion VR and machines good enough to render video in real time. The obivious use for that is rendering worlds like in a holodeck and as on Star Trek TNG. The obivious use for it will be movies, worlds we know. Books. 
 The lure of being in a world of a movie. It is just. Incredible. And now we have AI that can already play a part of a character based on a movie script. 
 All we need now is the ability to real time render video as AI commands, different characters all played by the AI according to their character. And some sort of worldbuilder AI that keeps tabs of it all.. 
 But it just seems like a no brainer. The real question is, will such a immersive AI world REPLACE movies. But it seems to me that it is only a matter of time until we will see such a form of entertainment. And yes, as a vision. It has been around for a long time. But now, we finally are starting to have tech to make it possible.

I’m currently looking for a role in data science/engineering but I am missing some practical experience in some typical MLOps/DevOps skills like cloud services (e.g. AWS).

 Is there any tool that can do that for me?
 So far I've found only Pictory.ai that has some of those features.

The images need to have an animal character (e.g. a dog... the story's protagonist) in them doing different things in each image. I've tried dalle2, but the character looks different from one image to the other. It makes it look like there are multiple dogs in the story, not one dog doing different things. Any suggestions for ways to create several different drawings that have the same-looking character in it?
