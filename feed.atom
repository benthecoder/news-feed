        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently applying for jobs as a data analyst but am having trouble putting together my resume in a way that is catered towards data science. I have a bachelors of science in sport’s administration with a minor in business administration. I’m a few months out from graduating with my masters of business administration with a focus in business analytics. 
 My issue is my work experience. I’ve held a lot of odd jobs over the years that I’m not including, like Chick-fil-A, or working as a cart boy. The 3 that I am including are not at all related to data analytics. This is because in undergrad, I loved the idea of working in sports and catered my resume towards that. I’m in sports now and despise it. 
 My work experience on my resume consists of a Marketing Graduate Assistant for a university athletic department, a marketing intern for a different universities athletic department, and an administrative intern at a hospital. I’ve been doing a ton of online learning and between that and my MBA, I’ve picked up skills in Python, R, SQL, Tableau, RapidMiner, Excel, MS SQL Server, and Power BI, all of which I’ve included as individual bullet points on my résumé. The majority of my résumé, however, consists of Job descriptions With no relevance to data analytics. 
 How do I do my résumé? do I keep the irrelevant job experience or should I minimize the space that takes and expand out my skills to describe how I developed them and what I can do with them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a 39yo professional. Have been around pretty much everywhere as far as software development goes (QA, requirements, a little bit of development, BPM, all the way to project management), but always wanted to get into DS. 
 I have taken loads of (good) online courses and have my personal DS projects up in github, but this doesn't seem to grab many recruiters' attention. I'm inclined to think people don't like aspiring DSs that have little to no professional experience. 
 So I'd like to hear everyone's opinion: what am I missing? Could it be that I have a far too generalist background, not being particularly expert in any one of those areas? 
 Also, I'd be more than happy to settle for a junior DS position as a first gig. Any ideias on what should I do to land my first job?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is my understanding that AI bots are in use by various actors on various websites. For example, their commercial use or use by propagandists to sway the views of the public, vs their open use for answering questions on company websites. 
 What is your best estimate regarding the prevalence of bots posting or commenting on reddit? What proportion do you think exists between bots who disclose their status as bots vs bots which their programmers intend to pass off as human users, or simply don't disclose? 
 Do you think the use of bots is currently well regulated on this site?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Usually for internships we are shown hourly rates, and I've seen most good DS roles lie between 40-60$/hr. A direct conversion to yearly pay seems a bit low compared to the full-time compensation packages that you see. I wanted to get an idea, on average, the full-time compensation or CTC given that the hourly intern pay is say 50$/hr, just so that it will be easier for me to compare.

From what I know, some AI models can be freely downloaded (it's the training part that's hard), and things like stable diffusion you can download and play around with yourself, so maybe if it doesn't exist I could mess around with that somehow, but I don't really know where to start.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, 
 One thing I realized while preparing Data Science, Machine learning interviews is that there is a huge syllabus to cover in a very short period of time. Depending on the type of roles, questions could range from SQL, Pandas, and Algorithmic coding questions to Machine Learning and Deep learning. 
 Currently, the typical go-to way of preparing for interviews is spending endless hours going through your notes, medium posts, googling for the right questions, etc. This is a time sink and not to mention very intimidating!
 So, I created bite-sized Q&A related to multiple different topics. Hope you find it a useful resource. More articles are added every week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an MSc and was wondering about other fellow data scientists, do you think many of us have PhD’s or is it not very common? Also, do you think in the coming years we will have more data science roles with PhD requirements or less? 
 Curious to understand which way the field is going, towards more data scientists with phds or lesser education.

 I am a bit puzzled by this:
 https://i.imgur.com/qVAJW85.png
 And these are my questions:
  
Is having a Date Table a thing? Isn't Date just a type of Data? Of course I can see how one wants to reference a certain date and return for instance which Quarter it belongs to. I do this presently in my SpreadSheets but I just calculate it, instead of having a table. And I can see that, but question #2 puzzles me more.
 So, OK, let's have a Date Table. But do we need a Date_ID? Shouldn't that just be the Date?
  
Thank in Advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a company that offers career development opportunities and they have two programs. One is in data science and the other one is in software engineering. Just not sure which one to go into. The data science one is a 1 year graduate program through a university online course. The software engineering route is a 3 month bootcamp that focuses on Java.
 The issue is that I want to find a route that is most "versatile." i know SEs make good money and many companies need tech workers. But I also feel like data scientists are more versatile since they know some programming but also have knowledge in statistics so they can use that for AI and ML. Plus seems like SE is highly saturated right now and unless you're working for FAANG or a start up, you're not going to be making a lot.
 But I am also 30 years old so i'm trying to solidify my foundation in one field and go with it.
 My background is in economics. I have a Masters in Applied Econ so I have knowledge in econometrics and stats. I have some background in SAS, SQL, and some beginner knowledge in Python as well like building lists, dictionaries, for loops, functions. 
 Idk if this matters or not but i'm in the US.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work as a director now but really it's more comparable to a manager role. I only have 4 people in my team and it generally seems to be an overblown title to compensate for a low salary.
 I haven't really got to do any technical work in a year and I miss it. I feel like my role is largely administrative and almost anyone can do it, with very little tech skills. So I have been looking around mainly for Principal DS roles (as I think that they generally have more hands-on work). I have currently a last stage interview for one such role. We have talked about salary and their offer would be 20% higher than my current salary. They also have a 15% bonus where my current company doesn't. I would also try to negotiate a bit more.
 I guess my worry is that it will look like going backwards on my CV and be a red flag if I changed jobs in the future.
 Edit: I am actually at a huge org, so externally on LinkeidIn etc it looks very impressive. The real story is that we have 21 DS directors. Some have 1 direct report. In the principal interview, I was even asked why do I want to give up such a high profile position which was annoying as it's not high profile at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all - I’m looking for some place to get excersizes in various levels. 
 A bit of a backstory; My primary work is as a product owner for a large fashion retailer. I am relatively new, been with the company for a year and three months. But I have 14 years of experience and 5 years as a product owner.
 Our teams primary goal is product performance; to decrease returns and making sure the customer has enough information about the product to be satisfied. 
 This requires from time to time that we analyze data. Sometimes this data is spread out in different datasets. 
 For many years in previous jobs I have been able to get by using excel and SQL queries.
 But a recent challenge required me to delve into more advanced techniques, so I decided to solve it using python and pandas. 
 Basically I had 3 raw datasets that I had to merge and create one dataset, but some of them didn’t have the same ID so I had to introduce a fourth dataset and so on and so on. 
 It was a ton of fun to say the least. But unfortunately I dont get to do this often enough in my work, so I am looking for some excersizes to do every now and then to learn and to keep the skills intact.

 In a lot of positions they have a requirement for Tableau or PowerBI. Well the former is not free and the latter requirements a work account which I don't have. Do you have have any recommendations for a similar program?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently working as a Data Analyst where I work predominantly in R, with a bit of SQL and Excel from time to time. I’d say I’m fairly good at coding in R, but I do still need to look things up from time to time (like syntax for different functions). Because of this I’d say I’m not a “natural” at programming. I also don’t really use things like GitHub very often, and my code is typically more of a “what gets the job done”, as opposed to “what does the job best”.
 My background is in Physics, so not directly computer science or data science. This also means that my mathematics is also quite strong but I’m by no means a statistician. But overall I do have plenty of experience in working with data.
 Just wondering if I’ve got the skill set (or at least the foundations) to be a successful data scientist?

 Built a quick tool I thought would be interesting - it’s a chrome extension that uses GPT-3 under the hood to help debug your programming errors when you paste them into Google (“eg. TypeError:…”). 
 This is definitely early days, so if this is something you would find valuable and wouldn't mind testing a couple iterations of, please feel free to join the discord -> https://discord.gg/KvG3azf39U

 Share a novel faceswap tool(www.swapface.org), which is much faster and lighter than deepfake, and could even run on a CPU. Anyone can use a photo to swap in the live streaming without training model, and the performance of faceswap is also good.
 It's a gift for all streamers and creators. Moreover, it's totally free and NO ads at all.
