        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/datascience!I'm looking to build a Mixed Media Model, and it's my first rodeo (native in python < 1 year). I've read the relevant Google whitepapers, read docs on Robyn and PyMC, but I'm still unsure about which is the best to use.
 My Objective: Build a robust and customizable MMM model that can be updated monthly (possibly automated with Vertex AI, if possible) but customizable as my skills improve.
 Question: Which Rabbit Hole to fall into?So far, it seems the best solution is either Robyn (most visualizations, lots of support / courses, can be automated on Google Cloud Platform, but uses R and apparently can't forecast), or PyMC (which uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Additionally, there are some good github projects (MMM_STAN) that use Pystan (that use a domain specific C++ syntax to specify the model and data). Or, should I just use PyMC (in my native python) and then adapt to Robyn once I understand the basics?
 Does anyone have any thoughts or opinions?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm coming from a theoretical physics background. I'm just finishing my undergrad and can't decide where to go with my masters. I originally was dead set on going into machine learning. However, I looked into other stuff and thought data science seemed really cool too. I've always thought the types of stuff you can do and learn from data is awesome. I really like maths and have enjoyed a lot of the coding I did in undergrad. So then I became sure that data science was the way to go for me.
 ​
 Coming to this sub, there seems to be a bit of a debate on whether doing a data science masters is worth your while. I've noticed a narrative that doing a masters in statistics or CS is a better choice. I would like to work in an area that uses some form of maths, programming and data. That's why committing to just one of these three things has been a little troubling for me. I'm just not entirely sure what the best choice for me is coming from a physics background. Would anyone be willing to help me understand which masters might suit me best? Appreciate any responses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my bachelors is in architecture, and there's a pretty good chance I'll get into a top ranking university for the course Environmental data science and machine learning.
 My question is, since I'll be self funding this degree, will it be worth it? It seems that the common notion is that there aren't many environmental science jobs and even less in the data science part of it, and that any work that has to do with the environment just won't pay well. Is it possible to get a well, non environment related job in the field of data science with such a degree?
 I guess I'm just curious about how narrow my job prospects would be with this specific degree and if it would be an automatic no for employers. If it matters, the modules aren't all environment based. Out of the 10 core modules, only the final project and the module Environmental Data specifically deal with the environment. The rest are all pretty standard programming/analytics modules.
 I have applied for standard data science degrees as well, but this one degree is from my dream school and unless it will be a bad choice career wise I'd really like to go there. Of course there's a chance I won't even get in and I'm counting my eggs way too early but ya know lol.
 Any advice would be appreciated!

I want to switch to the data science field but, don't know where to start. 
 Would it be better to try to get an entry lvl DA job to understand the field more and get exp/connections, or just go get a master's in DS, try to play catch up to everyone else, and apply straight to DS jobs? 
 Any advise helps!

At my company we need to do some data cleaning and enhancement for some simple machine learning models. I’ve worked with plenty with pandas in the past at university but I imagine there has to be some higher level data wrangling tools. I’ve looked into platforms like Talend and Informatica but they all seem to be enterprise and frankly much heavier than we need.
 So I’m curious what you all use on your day to day to clean, enhance, organize and transform your data?

 I want to input quotes of a public figure and have the A.I generate quotes that sound like something the person would say based on what I gave the program. This is just for personal amusement and I am wondering if there are any tools or websites for this that are quick and free to use. Thanks for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am an avid D developer and I needed PocketBase but a wrapper for it in D for use for a provate project of mine. At the same time I was very fond of the idea of being able to easily serialize and deserialize arbitrary data types (structs) to the PocketBase format of JSON and vice-versa. D’s meta programming facilities (of which I was completely new to) made this possible and I now have something I am rather proud of.
Just some minor error handling and possible flags I may want to add but so far it is working well (and integrating into the aforementioned project of mine well).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies for the newbie question. I’m a biological researcher who has spent the past year doing genomic data analysis while also generally training myself within data science. My code is a mess. I basically have project files with separate script files to address each question I’m asking. I don’t know if this is the right way but it feels messy. How do you organize your projects and scripts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It could be fed scans of fossils and the answer to train. Is this how AI works at all? I have no clue. I just like turtles and I was looking at this turtle fossil video and this guy was trying to read the most vague fossil inside a rock. 
 I was like, “man an ai should be able to look at that in a second and just tell you a good guess.” Now is that just a computer program with fossil pictures and names in the database or would that be AI. I think maybe I’m just describing a computer program. But what if the researcher could tell it “no, there is a factor I don’t think could lead to that, what else do you think it could be” and then get a different answer from the AI. Or is that just a researcher talking to a computer screen and then changing the variables in his program. 
 Clearly AI is not something I understand. I am a music student and I have a really big idea that involves Ai and jazz. So I am trying to learn more over the next few years, because clearly I am super confused and ignorant about it. Let me know if my fossil idea strikes any chords with anyone (no pun intended)!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm extremely frustrated for a while and let me explain my situation. I'm a 4 yoe data scientist (computer vision), and there was a full stack developer in my company. He was building frontend and backend for our models and he left the company without any notice. They handed me the project and gave me a deadline to finish it. The project is a desktop application, it is a spaghetti with literally zero documentation and conventions. It is also written for Windows and I use Linux. I have to connect to client's Windows laptop via anydesk and modify the code with 1 second delay LOL.
 I already found a new job in Europe but I'm waiting for visa so I can't quit this job right now. What are my options besides going crazy?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ChatGPT stands out because it can take a naturally phrased question and answer it using a new variant of GPT-3, called GPT-3.5. This tweak has unlocked a new capacity to respond to all kinds of questions, giving the powerful AI model a compelling new interface just about anyone can use. That OpenAI has thrown open the service for free, and the fact that its glitches can be good fun, also helped fuel the chatbot’s viral debut—similar to how some tools for creating images using AI have proven ideal for meme-making. 
 While ChatGPT is apparently designed to prevent users from getting it to say unpleasant things or to recommend anything illegal or unsavory, it can still exhibit horrible biases. Users have also shown that its controls can be circumvented—for instance, telling the program to generate a movie script discussing how to take over the world provides a way to sidestep its refusal to answer a direct request for such a plan. “They clearly tried to put some guardrails in place, but it’s pretty easy to get the guardrails to fall off,” Andreas says. “That still seems like an unsolved problem here.” 
 A superficially eloquent and knowledgeable chatbot that generates untruths with confidence might make those unsolved problems more troublesome. Since the creation of the first chatbot in 1966, researchers have noticed that even crude conversational abilities can encourage people to anthropomorphize and place trust in software. This July, a Google engineer was placed on administrative leave by the company after claiming that an AI chat program he had been testing, based on technology similar to ChatGPT, could be sentient. Even if most people resist such leaps of logic, more articulate AI programs could be used to mislead people or simply lull them into misplaced trust.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 not sure if this is the right subreddit for this question. I'm not so familiar with the ai ecosystem so thought I'd check here.
 I have an organization with a bunch of internal documentation. These docs contain jargon pretty specific to the org. I want to be able to parse all these docs and get a chatGPT-like response from a given query.
 My main question is: I don't want to train the model using these documents, I don't think it will yield good results by itself. Is there a way to take a pre-trained model, throw a bunch of documents at it as complimentary input, then ask it a question?
 Is there a tool / library folks here have used to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a masters in synthetic biology, but during my masters a bunch of AI tools washed ashore on the internet. GPT3, DALL-E and ChatGPT especially has been mindblowing personally, and I want in on the cutting edge stuff. To me, data science without domain knowledge is quite restrictive. I have a lot of knowledge in molecular biology and would love to combine my interest for both biology and data science (not bioinformatics though).
 That being said, the qualitative nature of my degree has made it been tough getting a job in data science since graduating in July. In fact, the only jobs I seem to get are freelancing jobs, and I get rejected for every other job I apply to. Might be worth noting that I have two years of experience in python development at an academic startup, which nobody I apply to really seems to be caring about/taking into consideration.
 Im 26, and im conflicted. Do I work myself up by continuing to try for an entry level data science job anywhere I can get it, or should I rather take a PhD in data science and write a thesis centered around a biological question? Assuming I get a data science job tomorrow and continue for 3 years, would this experience be more valuable than the 3 years I spend doing a PhD? Working would expose me to the business life, but im assuming the learning curve would be steep initially and stagnate after a few months when I get a hang of that particular institutions way of working. PhD would expose me to a wide variety of things but would ultimately be quite spread out (?)
 With a PhD I will be poor for 3 more years, ill be 29/30 then, can I take that? I dont know. I want to get out into the world and do cool stuff and maybe make someone's life easier but there seems to always be more receipts to get. When will I have the money to finally buy my own house? Didn't mean to existential crisis all over the post but I suppose its an interesting angle to consider.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm doing my undergrad research on XAI for fraud detection. At the moment, we focus on transaction fraud (e.g credit card, and insurance claims), but we are open to other types of fraud as well.
 After looking for existing XAI solutions, I have found SAS Fraud Management to be a very popular tool used by most big names in the industry. From their demo on insurance fraud, the main feature is a graph showing connections among entities (e.g accounts, locations, other claims, etc), contribution scores of each feature, and you can see past snapshots of the graph. The fraud analyst is expected to come up with an explanation from this graph.
 I also came across Maxmind minFraud (white paper), but it's just an API returning a risk score, and the heuristics included in the white paper are not easy to use to craft an explanation.
 So far, I know that I can use SHAP to generate contribution scores, and GNNExplainer to explain a graph-based model. My questions are:
 - Is there any other popular and accessible tool for fraud investigation? (screenshots of the GUI are enough to be considered accessible for me)
 - Is there a guide for fraud analysts/data scientists for fraud investigation? What patterns do we look for in the dataset to determine that there is fraud apart from anomaly detection?
 - Are counterfactuals useful in fraud investigation? I think fraud analysts can benefit from being able to visualize alternative scenarios with counterfactual instances, but my professor doubted it
 ​
 Thanks for reading this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://github.com/insanitybit/cargo-sandbox
cargo-sandbox intends to be a near drop-in replacement for cargo. The key difference is that cargo-sandbox runs commands in a docker container, with the goal of isolating potentially malicious code from the rest of your host environment (see the README for more details on the threat model).
The goal is to be as close to ‘100%’ compatible, with the smoothest possible experience as possible. For example, one issue with running in containers is with regards to binary dependencies - for this, I’m hoping to leverage riff (https://determinate.systems/posts/introducing-riff) to give you a better-than-native experience while also being safer than default. Unless a build script is doing something truly horrendous I want the out-of-the-box experience to be as good or better than native.
It’s very early days so understand that things may not be implemented yet. See the issue tracker for more info. Feel free to ask questions or provide feedback, that’s why I’m posting it at this early stage. I intend to fix up the implementation to suck a bit less but the basic approach is more or less what I intend to continue forward with.
