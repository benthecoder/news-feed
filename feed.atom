        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Where have people been and how was it? I'd like to stay within Europe, due to financial constraints.
 I have a strong interest in topics across the field (so as well as ML, things like Multi-Agent Systems(!), Ethics, Neural Networks, evolutionary/bio-computing) and would like something that isn't mainly ML. I'm thinking of doing a Master's at King's in London since the course seems well-rounded, but I've talked to someone who did the course and they feel that half the courses are lazily taught and lack depth (lectures that barely cover a topic, no practicals, tutorials without many questions, teaching only narrow parts of a field).
 I'm aware UvA is popular, but it's a two year course. Leuven's on my shortlist in particular (the modules look great: link) but I've since found someone on here complaining about more or less the same thing as KCL - many lazily taught courses, no practicals, etc. so now I'm not sure..
 I'm aware no course is going to be perfect and that you get out what you put in, but it'd be nice if the courses were somewhat detailed. Where did you go and what was your experience?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For me, it was two moments:
 1) Not every project required ML or deep learning, and that jobs focusing on that require a PhD and much more experience than I had as a new grad with an MS. You can almost forget about getting an ML research-oriented data science position with anything less than a PhD since most data science jobs value simpler approaches over the complex, and the other types of positions are in fact data analyst positions.
 2) Data engineering is a much bigger part of the job than I thought. I was pleasantly surprised to see how much I enjoyed this part of the job, to the point where I got a data engineering position under a data group that was more engineering-focused.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking at sports rankings for major tournaments throughout a 20 year period. Teams have a ranking, however, the method of ranking has changed quite often, so you cannot compare Tournament 1 ranks to Tournament 2. In order to get around this I decided to make each ranking relative to the highest ranked team for that tournament. However, this is squashing the rankings when the best team has a much higher rank than the rest/right-tailed. 
 Should I log transform the data or is there a better way to normalise the data rather than using relative ranks?
 Or should I leave the data as is, arguably if one team is very far ahead of the rest then the tournament is less competitive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before we talk about replacement, let us try to understand the real value of a good programmer. A good programmer’s value is not merely knowing "how to code." Programmers bring value by understanding "what to code."
 Simply put, they need to understand the business value of each requirement to be built and decide and prioritize their development based on the criticality. In a nutshell, they have fully functional "thinking" human brains.
 And the AI we see today is data-based. Yes, it can do things like categorizing images on Google, reading license plates, powering the routines of Alexa and Siri, and even using highly sophisticated methods of classifying data and recognizing patterns.
 But it cannot think like a human brain. For AI systems to be capable of 'thinking,' they need to be continually trained and fed with giant data banks covering every possible human scenario. This is not 100% possible.
 That is why AI can write code but can't ensure that it has written the correct code. It cannot understand the business value of features. It cannot refactor an old, buggy code and cannot decide whether to remove a piece of code or not.
 So, the future of software development and AI is collaboration and integration. AI will help programmers redefine programming by taking over tedious, repetitive tasks so that programmers can focus on building something great.
 Programmers can also pair with AI to write better software and reduce development lifecycle times. And far from replacing programmers, AI is becoming ready to reimagine a programmer’s workload through integration and enhanced efficiency.
 Here are five benefits of using AI in software development:
  
AI can validate project requirements
 Automatic debugging
 Automatic testing
 AI can make programmers more efficient
 AI will change software development

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new competition has just opened for registration by the United Nations, which will run in parallel to G20 in Indonesia but is open to all to participate remotely too. It will run from 8-11 of November, but pre-registration is required for individuals or teams up to 3.
 The competition differs from the typical Kaggle / DrivenData competitions because it focuses on the use of Privacy Enhancing Technologies to access and learn from the data. Taking part, you will interact with secure enclaves, differential privacy and synthetic data and become familiar with some of the leading privacy data science libraries like OpenDP (Harvard), SmartNoise (Microsoft) and DiffPrivLib (IBM Research). 
 There are also going to be a number of venues around the world where you can join in in-person and meet like-minded data scientists. The first location announcement was Harvard's John A. Paulson School Of Engineering And Applied Sciences for those in the Greater Boston Area. 
 There will also be webinars and Q&A ahead of time with the lead developers of each of the prominent frameworks. 
 For more information and registration: https://petlab.officialstatistics.org/ 
 If you would like to host an in-person location at a university or public space, reach out to [mira@oblivious.ai](mailto:mira@oblivious.ai), and there is support to help you run it successfully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta has just released AIT, an inference system for AMD and NVIDIA GPU hardware that claims to provide excellent inference performance.
 AITemplate transforms AI models into high-performance CUDA/HIP C++ code. It performs various graph transformations and optimizes execution time with new C++ kernel templates for the GPU target, while maintaining a minimal dependency on external libraries CUDA/ROCm.
 https://github.com/facebookincubator/AITemplate
 This is a really promising project intended to be an alternative to TensorRT and other inference tools. As maintainers of the opensource nebullvm inference accelerator, I am very eager to see the performance of AIT compared to other inference tools. We are working on integrating AIT in nebullvm so that users can test AIT, TensorRT, ONNX Runtime and other state-of-the-art inference optimizers to see which one provides the best performance for your model and hardware.
 Kudos Meta!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I am junior data scientist with computer science background, currently working in financial data science. Most of the time I do descriptive analyses with my team on tabular data with a goal to find where models can be useful. I also worked with scrapers, models and modeling pipelines a little bit. My boss told my team that we have budget for self development, so he encouraged us to use this funding for something useful for us, so I am looking for any relevant courses. I checked courses on coursera and they seem to be more entry level. I already had MLops course from coursera which I liked since it covered a lot of things we could possibly apply in the future. Tbh I have a feeling that I can get more knowledge from reading articles and relevant books and doing small projects, but funding has to be used, so. Do you have any interesting recommendations? Now I am considering to take something from Andrew Ng classic, since we don't have a need to use any neural nets on tabular data and I start forgetting things. I also have a feeling that I don't know statistics as well as I supposed to, but I am not sure there are any online courses which cover more than the average course in my uni. Last option is some cloud certifications, but we don't have anything in clouds by now and I am not sure if I need it currently.

 I was recently wondering whether I could use more relaxed phases at work to contribute to a certain cause. One I set my eyes on is human trafficking, but I suspect it requires heavier intelligence type of work, where familiarity is key (though I have experience with that), and less an occasional data analysis project. In case of any relevance - I’m living in Europe, but happy to look at any opportunity that has no issue with remote work.

Is it possible to make a career where I have to use SQL more than 80% of the time? And also another question is that if you know any such roles, which companies would you suggest me to do internship at for next spring or summer where I can work in these types of role ? I’m based on Pittsburgh Pennsylvania.

 I’m not really versed in A.I or deepfake technology. My question is, with the democratization of this sort of tech, how can platforms or developers themselves prevent these kinds of videos from getting exposure, and possibly harming people? Can certain demographics be preyed on with this kind of tech?

The code contains python packages such as graphql to extract the data and sqlalchemy to inject the data into the database. I’m trying integrate this code into beam api, but I have no clue how to do so. Do I have to generate the data first and then use the csv output for my pipeline or can I just insert all of this into a beam pipeline and extract the csv by executing the apache beam code? Any help is extremely appreciated thank you for reading.

 We have a ID (let’s call it Pseudo ID) which represents a customer, that has their session(s) as another ID inside of it. 
 We’re seeing about 4% of the sessions have the same Pseudo ID. We think it’s because it’s the same customer switching between desktop and mobile devices, but hard to tell.
 Should we exclude the duplicate Pseudo IDs? The lift of the experiment is positive if you include or exclude them, but the variance is about 5% between the results. 
 How would you look at this? Include the duplicate IDs, or exclude them?

Operational Research and Applied Statistics where I did time series forecasting, supply chain modelling, Credit risk churn models, Financial risk analysis and math behind hypothesis tests and more statistics. I did my dissertation with govt predicting property values where I used XGBoost. I am really confident with python and I believe I can learn anything If I put the time and effort. Though I am finding it hard to find my first job because of lack of experience. I'm planning to enhance my learnings in Data visualization like PowerBI which I used in dissertation though I didn't have much idea on it. What do you think I should learn or do for increasing my chances of getting hired. I almost all the time pass the numerical and logical assessments companies offer but Im having a hard time finding my foot into the industry. I wish I could do work for free for a month or so and make them believe I can learn stuff.

 Probability, stochastic calculus, modelling
 Data collection, data engineering

Do you typically work in this structure?
 For DS to succeed, what do you think, how important is it to have a great supporting team (DE, BA etc.)?
 Are there pros and cons of it you can think of?

 Im wondering if I should skip on it. The alumni tell me its no good for people who are already professionals and I am already a professional epidemiologist with a fair amount of stats background. 
 Is it worth it? I mean theres the opportunity cost obviously. I lose a year of life and income, and then Im forced to remain in my third world country for 2 years after. It is offerred by a so called top 35 world University in the UK but the omissions are very strange. I do not know R, Python, machine learning, AI, etc
 CLIFF: I am wondering if in the opinion of data scientists out there if the ommission of math and data management would be a complete deal breaker for you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just figured the explanation that I added with question wasn't posted. So, here's the scenario:
 We open sales of a product begining of the Fall every year. Now that we have data collected about the customers and their transactions, we are trying to predict customer level probability of purchasing the product before Fall - ideally each week of Summer to use that to customize promotional campaign. 
 What we are planning to do is get historic data snapshots as of the end of Summer, train model on this data. Thhen from the next Summer use this model to predict the outcome of the Fall purchase. Now the question was basically, does it sound like a sound technique to use this end of Summer model to predict during the Summer? Or should we train separate models for each week of Summer - so basically for each weekly model we'd get historic data snapshots as of the end of that week rather than end of the whole Summer and train the models separately.

Designed specifically for programming, which is a corner of typography that involves intensive typing that feels more akin to handwriting than typesetting, this typeface took inspirations from the friendly characteristics and low-resolution legibility of Comic Sans. It is an unapologetic admittance of the positives of the source design, and a literal manifestation of “code like nobody’s watching”. Comic Code only takes inspiration from Comic Sans and was drawn entirely from scratch, in case you are wondering.
