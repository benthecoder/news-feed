 I'm currently preparing, but I don't really know what to expect.
 What are some core points I should focus on? What are typical questions? 
 About me: I'm coming from a theoretical physics background; currently doing my masters in computational science with focus on numerics and simulation. I also took a deep dive into advanced statistics during the last year. I have alot of experience with C++ and Python, and base experience with predictive analytics using machine learning algorithms. 
 Thanks for any advice in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I been unemployed since may. I was a DS for a year at a tech company. I applied for more than 300 and this past week I decided to start a program that will apply for jobs for me at any entry level position in DS or data engineering, even software engineering. 
 I have had countless interviews getting to 2nd to last interview process at times, yet it hits hard when getting rejected. About 70% of what I hear is "we want someone with my experience and with you not fitting the 2 or 3 years we are looking for this entry position, it doesn't quite cut it."
 I have 1 year before being let go and job changed to less technical, more consulting. (corporate decision also i didnt wabt to be in consulting) 
 I just don't know what more I can do. I'm even debating on going to do my masters. Only thing that sucks is my bills. But I'm to a point of I rather be in bed than code anymore. 
 It seems that the job market has changed drastically where entry position is 2+ years of experience rather than just graduating and getting it. My tech skills are there for entry, yet experience isn't. Been told by a great manager that "I still have raw skills and I need to find a place where they will take the time and have you grow withing the company."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! Just made the switch from a more business analytics focused role to a forecasting role. I’m staying within my company, so I’m pretty familiar with the business and the domain. Trying to catch up on recent developments in the space, and haven’t looked into forecasting since my Masters a few years ago, so I’m pretty rusty. 
 I’m currently making my way through Hyndman’s Forecasting: Principles and Practice as a review, then I’m planning to catch up on Prophet and NeuralProphet (my company is currently employing Prophet models in Python AFAIK). Also considering looking into some Kaggle forecasting competition notebooks just to see what that community has been employing. 
 Any recommendations on papers, SubReddits, podcasts, packages (R or Python) etc. that have recently pushed the needle on what’s possible, or have material on more modern best practices in the field? Or any opinions on my learning plan for now? 
 My intuition on the methodological requirements is that interpretability is pretty important since the models tend to be looked at with a pretty high degree of scrutiny, but regardless I’m open to any and all suggestions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me know why you decided to get into data science or machine learning and how you managed to actually get into the field.
  
How did your interview go? Did you fake it till you made it?
 Is your job what you thought it was? Are there any other fields you would look into if you could do it all over again?
 How much does money motivate you to stay in data science/ML?
 What regrets or advice do you have when looking back on your decisions?
  
As a senior in college, I have regretting not going the data science/ML route. But I was recently told that its not too late for me, and that a statistics and marketing background isn't the worst for ML jobs.
 I figure its always best to talk to the people who have been through the gauntlet ahead of me, so any and all insights as appreciated!

 What is the face of the man behind the apple? For almost 60 years, the figure wearing a sombre suit and bowler hat in René Magritte’s painting “The Son of Man” has been obscured by a polished green apple. His facial features were intended to remain a mystery, the fruit an artistic provocation. Today, using new technology, 23-year-old digital artist Josephine Miller can roll the apple away. 
 Miller tilts her laptop towards me in the hushed café of the British Library in London to show how she used Dall-E 2, software that generates images using artificial intelligence (AI), to remove the frui…]]></summary>

 My computer does not have enough store storage for nor is my internet good enough to download and them upload it else where. 
 Is there a way to just `images = example.com/myimages/` and `csv = example.com/imageannotations.csv` without downloading the data locally? (the syntax will obviously different for loading them in)
 Also will just downloading the train csv be enough or do I need to have the corresponding images locally as well? I am having a hard time telling what files I need to download from the list.

Right now I’m pulling them straight from an API that doesn’t have great functionality so I can’t filter for tags themselves. All I can do is download jsons that contains lists of tags for each datapoint. If I’m interested in analyzing tags, what’s the best way of structuring the data? It seems like I’ll probably need to construct some sort of relational database, but I’m not a data engineer by training and was wondering if there’s a simpler method that I’m missing.

It's Descriptive Analytics where I will be writing/executing SQL queries and working with data management and reporting to the team. In the future I hope to seek a data analyst intern position. It's also a government job, would this intern be a strong foundation for me to land a future data analyst internship since it overlaps in some aspects of skills required (SQL)?

 There are N samples, and they are ordered (e.g. by timestamp.) Each sample has M different features measured. I want to pick the best timestamp to split the data into "before" and "after" in a way that minimizes the RMSE of the overall dataset once you subtract the mean values from the "before" and "after" groups.
 For example, say there is a machine that takes Skittles of five colors and fills a bag by mixing them. At some point, its performance changed - say, it used to give 5% too many yellows, and now it gives the right number of yellows and purples but 10% too few reds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently made the decision to graduate early from undergrad (statistics major) and now I’m feeling completely lost on what to do after I graduate. For me to be competitive for a serious career in data science, is a masters degree completely necessary? Also, does anyone have any insights on online masters programs and which ones are favorable?

 So I was wondering what are some ways to make money from DS/ML/Stats/Math other than your traditional job and content creation (I am already doing that). 
 Are there anyways to get an extra buck or some simplistic products I can create or sell? 
 Thanks, hopefully will be a fruitful discussion. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I lurked here for a bit before coming onto reddit. I am early in my grad program (MS Data Analytics), and I just finished my first week of my part-time, fully remote work, data science internship at a large company. The company is much larger than my previous job, which was a part-time bookkeeping at a small church. And I feel kind of lost and anxious. I wasn't able to ask as many questions as I wanted to this first week. It looks like everyone else is pretty busy, as they immediately jump off the call when the scheduled end time hits. Today I attended a meeting with my direct manager and two other team members (one of whom was assigned to me as my mentor of sorts) to discuss requirements for a project they want me to work on, and it was all over the place. I wasn't able to follow any of it aside from the first few minutes, and the rest of the meeting was the two other team members and my direct manager talking about something that happened a year ago. 
 I have been reassured by my direct manager that I'm basically going to be useless for the first few weeks, because their IT is notoriously slow and they have yet to install everything on my work computer I need. But it's doing little for my nerves. I do try to keep myself busy. I do make sure I tried a couple of things before I ask questions; I know these people are busy. I haven't even finished looking through everything they sent me yet. I've never received so many emails in my entire life continuously. Is it normal to feel like everything is already piling on?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using sklearn for a long time and I understand what it's doing, I know which techniques are appropriate for which tasks.There's no shortage of Sklearn tutorials and data science courses to learn the concepts and see examples. 
 But there's all these syntax details within sklearn that are harder for me than they should be. With other libraries like Pandas I can write new code without a reference, or look at readthedocs for quick reference. But with Sklearn I'm googling, copy pasting code, changing it, getting errors and trying random shit until the errors stop. I do this a lot without improving my understanding.
 Obviously I'm missing core knowledge but I don't know what it's called to even look for it. If I look something up in Sklearn readthedocs I don't know if I should something.somethingelse() Or I should something(somethingelse) Or I should mything=something() mything(somethingelse)
 Then there's words like estimator, object, method, constructor, class, pipeline, transformer. I look them up in the glossary, but I am no closer to grasping their specialness. I know a Pipeline when I see it, but despite reading tutorial after tutorial on Pipelines I cannot find an answer to what makes a Pipeline a different beast from a bunch of functions. For that matter, a lot of this stuff sounds like functions but...aren't? Does this have something to do with the functional versus object oriented programming debate? My limited understanding of this debate is that functional programming is logical and object oriented makes me disoriented.
 Is there a book everyone read that I didn't hear about??? I want to be able to look at readthedocs and have that convey to my brain what to type in Python, without resorting to monkey business. How do I get my brain there?

 thx in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most people agree that having a whiteboard during a meeting, or having diagrams & charts in a paper is better than not - but I don’t see a lot of discussion about what makes a great diagram / architectural sketch / etc.
If reading is the way to become a better writer, I assume that looking at examples of good diagrams is the way to improve how I communicate visually. So let’s share examples of great diagrams about CS, software, hardware, etc and why we think they’re great.
Alternatively, if there’s a site or book that already has a collection focused on visual explanations of computing concepts that we should know about please share that.
I think e.g. Tufte’s books are probably required reading along these lines, but they are much more general purpose and I’m curious about great examples in computing.]]></summary>
