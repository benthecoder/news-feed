        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, Im a first year accounting student which plans to only take 3 courses per semester to give me plenty of time to self teach data analytics. Using this link https://www.evernote.com/shard/s733/sh/40fb7bee-b0ee-0ef7-0001-cc15d51c39de/ba2d863167afb5ff2228764ad8d6dc68
 ​
 Could you guys check my plan for the first two years of university? Also, be extremely honest on what improvements or anything I need to change. Appreciate your time. ( made the plan in 3 hours so I'm aware its not the most organized and aesthetic sorry lol )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! I’ve been a secondary math teacher for 9 years and within the next year, I’m looking to switch into Data Science. For some background, I do have B.S. degree in Mathematical Statistics but have only been in education. 
 From that degree, I have experience in Java and C++ programming along with several statistics courses and other higher level math courses. Should I do a bootcamp to get the skills needed to get into this field? (I’m more worried about not knowing things like R, Tableau, SQL, Python, or Power BI.) I’d like to know what I’d need to master before I can start advertising myself as a DS on Linked In. 
 Also, how do I make myself appealing to potential employers? I feel as if being in education sometimes downgrades one’s value to several organizations since educators (in the US at least) have lost respect and aren’t seen as valuable much anymore. 
 If anyone here is in charge of hiring other DS candidates, what exactly are you looking for on a resume?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Current context: Have two bachelors in CS and Business. Been working as a DS for about a year.
 While working as a DS, I have noticed that job applications for DS have been more explicit in asking for a Masters in CS, Stats, Math, DS etc... So now, I am curious about the future of DS, and whether only individuals with a Masters / PhD will be accepted for these roles; or that experience alone would be enough to bypass these filters?
 Especially at larger tech firms, it seems that they only look for applicants with at least a MS. What do y`all think about this?

I don't want it to be the only thing that I do (which is why I don't want to do SWE) but I want to have coding as a component of my job, along with being project-based and working with people / making presentations and stuff like that. Any advice is much appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I built a classic Macintosh text editor that allows users to do shared bidirection live editing with a web browser on a modern computer. Essentially it allows allows you to really quickly and easily share and edit text snippets on a classic Macintosh. I've tested the software on System 2.0 through System 7.6.1, but it should work on all PPC and 68k Macintoshes running up to MacOS 9.2.2 assuming they have a modem serial port available.
In addition to the github repository, I wrote up a blog post here: https://henlin.net/2022/10/02/Introducing-FocusedEdit-for-cl...  outlining how to get up and running. Both the repo and the blog post have a demo gif to help explain exactly what FocusedEdit does as well as how it works.
If you have any questions or decide to try it out on your Macintosh or in an emulator, let me know! I'd love to hear about it!

>Also, I think today we’re kind of overburdened by choice. I mean, I just had Fortran. I don’t think we even had shell scripts. We just had batch files so you could run things, a compiler, and Fortran. And assembler possibly, if you really needed it. So there wasn’t this agony of choice. Being a young programmer today must be awful—you can choose 20 different programming languages, dozens of framework and operating systems and you’re paralyzed by choice. There was no paralysis of choice then. You just start doing it because the decision as to which language and things is just made—there’s no thinking about what you should do, you just go and do it.
For context this book is copyrighted 2009 so this interview is more than a decade old, and I'm sure many things have changed since then.

 I study a msc in business and data science, where I transferred from a market analysis- oriented bachelors.
 For the third semester we can chose between electives or an internship, where I am wondering whether I should take some statistics/CS heavy electives or if I should do a 6-month internship. 
 As the masters only have 45 ECTS worth of hard, actual Data Science oriented courses, I was wondering what would be the smartest choice ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I'm working in a startup and I'm running a lot of reports and do data cleanup / wrangling for finance reports. Most of my work I do in python and some Excel here and there.
 That's all fine, but the next evolution is that I want to build systems in which I don't have to run the reports for my colleagues but build some sort of system / UI that makes it easy for them to run their own reports.
 The data flow is not very complex but also not very easy to understand for novices. We have a lot of 3rd party csv files that need to be manipulated, merged and formed into reports.
 My colleagues are tech illiterate. So installing python on their laptops and letting them run scripts is too complex. Writing a UI in python and letting them run self coded .exe files is prevented by IT department of the holding our startup is connected to. 
 So I'm searching for a soulution that has a) great data manipulation capability and b) is capable of building nice UI capabilities
 ​
 A typical task looks like this:
  
Download one or more .csv files from a 3rd party tool
 Data Cleanup
 Match the data to entries in our database
 Create various pivot tables
 Loop through the user database and create PDF reports for each user
  
​
 I tried building most tools in excel, but boy do I hate this program. I mean... for easy data manipulation and visualisation it's fine, but there's a lot of issues when you start writing a lot of UI
 I thought about PowerBI - does anyone have experience with it? Looks great for even more complex reports, Tableau would also work
 That's a first time I have to choose the infrastructure, so I'd love to hear your opinions!

 What % of time do you spend on repeatable / simple SQL? 
 Complex queries / something you are doing for a deep dive can be ignored (consider this part of core work) 
 I’ll go first, when I was in an individual contributor role this would be 30-40%
 EDIT: by repeatable I mean queries that are simple and don’t vary much. For example, orders by day, week, month or retention by day, week, month. Basically queries that are straightforward but you HAVE to do cause other folks don’t know SQL

The metrics are employee atrributes say how much occupied the employee is each time frame, how engaged he is with his team in terms of percentage, how much absent he was from work etc… all these are already available measures.
 I also have some employees data who have attrited voluntarily. What I need to do is to predict who all would be the future employees that would potentially resign based on the metrics captured over a period of time.
 Which model should be ideal to begin with. Its would be a potential binary classification problem. So the output will be for existing employees 1 or 0 based on the time series metrics of his past datapoints based on the assumption of the already attrited employees with similar metrics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I work for a company that has limited data. We are a manufacturing company with 4000 different items. The cycle time here ranges between 7 and 90 days (on average 3 weeks). There are different product groups with production lines.
 We have various challenges which cause individual orders ( 1 item per order) to be delayed. These are manufacturing, assembly, and packaging processes including times when items have to rest for a certain time.
 Now I would like to determine per order - when a process has been started or completed late - which remaining cycle time is still to be expected.
 I have the following historical data (2 years) in a simple form:
  
 Item Process Start End 
  
 IK100 1 01.01.2022 02.02.2022 
  IK100 2 04.01.2022 06.01.2022 
 
 Based on past performance, I would now like to determine what the expected time is. 
 ​
  
What would be the best way to do this? 
 So what basic steps are necessary now?
  
​
 I have some knowledge of statistics and simulation, just need to brush up on it. 
 I am grateful for any tip, blog, book

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All,
 I'm starting a masters in CS (OMSCS) this upcoming January with the goal of prepping myself for data science. I’m looking to bring my stats knowledge up to par to understand texts like Deep Learning- Goodfellow, PRML, ML A Probabilistic Perspective, etc. 
 My background is civil engineering and in undergrad took Calc 1-3, Diff Eq, Linear Algebra and a non-calc based stats 101 type class. When I got my masters in Civil-Transportation I took some stats modeling classes that covered regression (linear, logistic, poisson, negative binomial, etc) pretty heavily using R+NLOGIT.
 At this point my stats knowledge is pretty disjointed and feel like I dont have a solid understanding of the fundamentals. From what I can tell with some research the most popular recommendations I've seen are:
  
Statistical Inference- at first glance this book feels way above my level, like I can probably work out some things with effort, but I'll probably need another book to fill in the gaps.
 All of Statistics- Looks solid as a reference for someone who's taken way more stats than I have, super concise but super dry read.
 Mathematical Statistics with Applications(Wackerly)- This is one that feels like could be a possibility
 Introduction to Probability(Blitz)- This feels like the other contender
  
So far books 3 and 4 seem like best options, is there anything else I'm missing or votes one way or another?
 ​
 Thanks!

I love scifi and stuff as well it all got me thinking about where this is headed and I wanted to know how long it may realistically take till we get there. I could see a world where you could feed a neural network all the episodes of Seinfeld and it could give you an infinite number of new episodes, all rendered in photo realistic detail. Could be any show, King of Queens, Everybody Loves Raymond, Family Guy, Community. 
 You could also have an ai write and generate shows based on current trends with no input from human beings. All the voice work and acting would he generated. Then the show could morph and change in real time based on reception and feedback. 
 So how long until those things are realistically possible, or at least close? I know we already have some video generators but they aren't very good. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say we have a book with many chapters, how do you detect plot twists?
 I tried with sentiment analysis but it’s not good enough, since the book goes basically like:
 Man is about to meet an old friend -> he finds out he died -> friend wakes up from the coma and is alive -> he’s an impostor and the actual friend did die. 
 Any other ideas?
