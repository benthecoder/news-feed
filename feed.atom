        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am currently in a master's program for applied data science. Our program does not require a thesis, rather 3 large projects (2 milestone projects and a capstone). I am at the end of my program and the capstone is approaching in two months where I will have 3 months to turn in a project that "shows I've pushed my abilities to their limits". The project is very open ended, no specific requirements, other than I have to make use of a publicly available dataset. 
 My issue is that after 2 other milestone projects which I've poured my heart into, I feel completely burned out and lacking ideas. My first two projects were centered around NLP and processing twitter data to extract meaningful emotional sentiments which were then used in different forecasting scenarios to predict emotions by topic. Both projects recieved high grades and I feel like I've exhausted my interest using NLP and social media data. 
 For the capstone I'd like to look at something that is more in line with a "wicked problem". One suggested project is to help the Allen Institute for Brain Science by providing insight to their publicly available dataset. This is something I really like, as it could have a meaningful impact, and it contributes to a larger altruistic cause. 
 My question to this community is: Are you aware of other institutes and/or communities that have available data which can be analyzed toward a greater good? Consortiums that are asking the public for help on a problem. 
 Honestly I'm not sure what I should be searching for. I'm trying to create a list and I've looked into cancer data sets, alzheimer's, all the big diseases, but I can't seem to find a topic that hasn't been analyzed to death. Any fresh perspectives would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I’m in need for some career advice. I’m currently working for a startup biotech company. I’m work on the manufacturing side to manufacture cancer therapy for phase 1-3 drugs. I have about 4 years of GMP manufacturing experience. I’m looking to get out of manufacturing because of the long 12+ hrs shift. I’m currently getting my master in business analytic, we’re currently learning stats for business and R. We plan to learn machine learning, tableau, power BI, and other things. Is it possible to combine my biotech experience and master to get into data science? Any advise is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone so I recently had an interview for a mid-level DS role. Throughout the interview they kept it pretty generic and high level just trying to gauge an understanding of how you thought about a problem and solved it.
 ​
 We did get to a point however where we reached a case study style of "walk us how you would solve this". The problem was that essentially customers of the service abuse certain offers costing the business money, and how would we go about solving this problem and training a machine learning model to do this for us.
 ​
 Given that they described it as a supervised problem with a known set of a customers, I said let's go about taking that and making a training set. Since it was imbalanced with a 1% target we could upsample our minority class and have a reasonable 10/9…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are quite a few recent posts about pros and cons of Jupyter in the DS field and I don't want to add to that. My question is more about tooling prevalent in corporate environments. Most of the time Python DS stack is limited to remotely hosted Jupyter lab instances (in contrast R stack includes paid subscriptions to Rstudio server, which is a great tool that can live in a browser!)
 What are the options available of one wants a hybrid IDE + Notebook workspace if ssh is blocked (almost all the time in corporate)
 I feel like Jupyter is hindering a push towards a Foss or paid alternate to Rstudio server for python. (I've heard VS code is attempting sever side tool which can be accessed through the browser but not sure if it's available for production (corporate use) yet. I know there can be workarounds using paid (new rstudio for python) options but since jupiter is so widespread its really hard to get the heads to spend money on something new and untested. 
 I'm surprised that as a community we seem to be content with J.

I really want to be a researcher in strong AI one day and I want to start my journey as soon as possible. It’s just that I’m not a beginner and I want to become great at this so I don’t where to go. 
 I’ve already got an A in calculus 1 and 2, linear algebra, statistics, a grad level signal processing and machine learning class. Also I’ve placed quite well in AMCS and AIME. I’ve also published 5+ papers on graduate level applied math/cs/physics papers. Though I don’t have the best memory I’ve done work with NN, ANN, CNN, SVM, KNN, autoencoders, signal processing (Fourier and wavelets) in python, Matlab, Java, and SQL.
 Where should I go from here? I would prefer a more structured program that’s on the less expensive side bc uni is easily gonna cost 200K >>>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good evening everyone,
 I have a task with a client, he gave me a dataset full of hotel description and I must add tags to them. A tag can be "own_outdoor_pool", "close_to_beach", "luxe" just to give some examples. As it is real world data, we cannot do supervised ML or DL as the dataset is not labelled with those tags. What I do right now, is to do a subsentence segmentation with a DL model, I build an "initialisation file" where I give for the tag an initialisation sentence, let's have the tag "own_outdoor_pool" some initialisation sentences could be for exemple "outdoor pool in the hotel", "a pool located outside", "you can find a pool in the garden", and I do this for every tag. Then I do sentence embedding with a NLP model for the subsentences of each description and each initialisation sentence and I compute a cosine distance of each subsentence of the description of the hotel with all the initialisation sentences for each tag. It works pretty well, the highest distance gives the good tag usually, I also put a treshold aroung 0.55 to avoid useless tag for not relevant subsentences. The issue that I have is with overlapping tag such as "heated_pool", "indoor_pool", outdoor_pool". As the initialisation sentences for these 3 tags are similar, the distance with subsentences of a given hotel description that have pool in them will have a high cosine distance with these 3 tags. A subsentences with heated pool will have high cosine similarity with the two tags "indoor_pool" and "outdoor_pool" where I want to get the tag "heated_pool".
 I am thinking to use the inverse of a penalty, meaning that I would like to increase the significance of a word such as indoor, outdoor or heated to get the proper tag. Yet, I do not know how to do it. Do anyone here can give me a hint? Some ressources available? Thank you in advance.
 NB: Sorry for my english, not my lative language.

We are selling standalone boring, mainly desktop (although it runs on beefier laptops as well) software. It's for Windows and written in boring technologies (C99 for the engine and C# for GUI).
We are considering various business models when it comes to selling it in the future as our current one causes a lot of problems. Some options and thoughts I have about them right now:
1)What I call a "classical model" which we tried so far: release 1.0 version, sell it for a fixed price. Continue to support it for a while with bugfixes/features. At some point move to developing 2.0 version, sell it again (giving discounts for current 1.0 customers).
Advantages: simple, the customers can use software they purchased forever
Disadvantages: at some point you need to start collecting features…]]></summary>

From my experience, so much of the material I find online on these basic (but crucial) concepts rarely go beyond just that - the basics. This repo is clear and concise, presents pros and cons for different methods, and includes code examples. 
 So I thought I'd share it here for others to consume, and open for others to post similar stuff that they have found helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Guys,
 I am a data scientist at a senior level with a Masters in Statistics + 6 years of experience. I loved the ML and data exploration part but as soon as I got into the industry I understood that it's all about documentation and PPTs. There is hardly good data in real world. I am good at my work and everyone appreciates my work at the office, I even got awarded for my work.
 Here's the issue, I am technically inclined and the tasks I do is really boring and simple. I don't know what should I do? I am losing the interest in the field. I try to find time to do side projects but after marriage and kid, I don't get any time + I need to keep my sanity and don't want to keep stressing out to keep up. What should I do?

Companies are increasingly interacting with their customers through communities on Slack and Discord. This trend will continue, because building a strong community around your product is a moat, leading to better retention and revenue. However, while Slack and Discord are great communication tools, they aren’t designed for community teams to engage with thousands of members at a personal level.

 It is a new field for me and aside from Predictive models for sales, I haven't a lot of ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, how's it going? I want to start studying the world of AI but I am not clear on a topic. From what I understand and I was informing myself, the AI ​​is divided into two large branches. On the one hand, deep learning and machine learning. Deep learning has algorithms that are more similar to how a human being processes information, more intelligent, so to speak. Machine learning algorithms are more focused on learning with large amounts of data, this would cover what big data is and all that field. I am right? What known algorithms are developed with machine learning and deep learning?

 Edge ML is a technology that allows Smart Devices to analyse data locally utilising machine and deep learning algorithms, decreasing dependency on Cloud networks. This article will be focused on understanding the working and functionality of Edge Machine Learning. Following are the topics to be covered.

 I like Plotly for its interactive features and would like to know the easiest way to share the result with other team members, who might not have Juypter notebook or Python installed. For non-interactive graphs I can just share PDFs or say, Matplotlib plots. But I like to do so with Plotly without requiring anyone to install anything.
 Is it possible to create an offline webpage using Plotly and just share the Chrome page as a file? (via email) 
 I don't want to host anything on any centralized server since I deal with many teams.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AlphaGo was able to surpass a human because it can play itself a million times in an hour. I got to thinking if an AI could be trained on complex video games like Skyrim in the same way.
 A human has to play a game like Skyrim for a hundred hours but a computer wouldn't have to "play" the game to experience it. It could just look at the code and execute it in the mind's eye without being real time. Similar to it creating a virtual machine and playing the game in the virtual machine so the game doesn't know it's being played in fast forward.
 Experiencing a game by interpreting the EXE would be magnitudes more efficient than actually playing the game though because it would understand what the game looks like with textures loaded without having to actually render every frame with them. It could "play" the game in wireframe a thousand seconds per second if it would even experience the game in that way while interpreting the code directly.
 A system like this could "experience" thousands of games (Witcher, Zelda, etc) and learn how to imagine different games. A text-to-game system similar to current text-to-image.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I am currently at my first semester studying to become a data scientist, and my calculus professor gave me a project.
 Long story short, I need a function that represents any phenomenon happening in data science. I was told to use “optimización de la segunda derivada” according to google it’s the second derivative test.
 I have to show the function, the derivative, explain a graphic representation, etc…
 The thing is I have no clue where to begin… I was hoping anyone here could give some advice. 
 TLDR: I need a function that represents any phenomenon happening in data science.
