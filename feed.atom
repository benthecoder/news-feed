 I am a host of a podcast that helps students and young professionals with all things personal and career development. 
 I got a question about how to stand out for a data science internship. I know having a portfolio or github would help, but want to validate with the community. 
 This is one of my favorite subreddits bc of the smart and realistic community ! 
 Any other ways you would recommend to standout while on the job hunt (getting a job in data science)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys! This is on here cause there is no genetic algorithm subreddit and it is a similar field to AI. A while ago I noticed there were no good genetic algorithm libraries. So these last few weeks have been busy... Anyways, here is the GitHub link: dadukhankevin/Finch: A Keras style GA genetic algorithm library (github.com)
 Here is a basic example of a GA that finds solutions to equations. It evolves and presents the best answer it can come up with. There's more info on the GitHub page ^
 from Finch.FinchGA import generic
 from Finch.FinchGA import FitnessFunctions as ff
 from Finch.FinchGA import Environments, GenePools
 from Finch.FinchGA import Layers as l
 desired = 10
 expression = """((x**y+z)*h)/j+t+l*k/x"""
 eq = generic.Equation(["x", "y", "z", "h", "j","t","l","k"], expression, desired=desired)
 fitness = ff.EquationFitness(desired_result=desired, equation = eq)
 pool = GenePools.GenePool(list(range(1, 150)), fitness.func, mx=100, mn=0.001) 
 env = Environments.SequentialEnvironment(layers=[
 l.GenerateData(pool, population=30, array_length=8),
 l.SortFitness(),
 l.Mutate(pool, select_percent=50, likelihood=10),
 l.NarrowGRN(pool, delay=1, method="best", amount=1, reward=.2, penalty=.05, mn=.1, mx=200, every=1),
 l.UpdateWeights(pool),
 l.Parents(pool, gene_size=1, family_size=6, percent=100, every=4, method="best", amount=2), # parents the best ones
 l.KeepLength(100), #keeps a low population
 ])
 env.compile(epochs=100,every=10, fitness=fitness.func, stop_threshold=.99)
 hist, data = env.simulate_env()
 info = env.display_history()
 print("best percent: "+str(env.best))
 print("best individual: "+str(env.best_ind.chromosome.get_raw()))
 print(info)
 env.plot() 
 Please play around with it and give me feedback!

 I'm more of a BI analyst, but I've been challenged to broaden my skillset with some data science tasks. I've got some exposure to data science concepts, but nothing I've utilized in any full time role. 
 My task is to take some transactional data thats been categorized. Think something like credit card transactions, and how vendors get categorized (fast food, medical etc). If I'm trying to identify someone who might use a particular product based on their past spending history, what type of an analysis am I using to tease that out. 
 So if in this complete dataset I have users who've purchased product A. How would you go about doing a look-alike to find users who spend the same way as those who have product A but don't currently subscribe?
 I don't expect to be spoon fed, but more so to give me some key word search terms to help me get on the right path. 
 I appreciate the assistance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my two previous roles we were just using Python scripts orchestrated with Airflow. At my current job, we use databricks. I think mostly because there’s a lot of junior DS and they like cramming stuff into notebooks. I can’t find a good workflow. The fact that the databricks environment is so bad compared to a nice IDE like PyCharm is really limiting for me. Ideally I want to do most of the development locally and use databricks to run the code when I need a lot or resources but I can’t find a way that seems reasonably user friendly and end up going back and forth between local and cloud/db env using git. 
 Does anyone have a good flow to recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game Engines have had no-code game development tools since eons. Result which is awesome games especially indie. We have visual no-code tools for AI development, but they are:
 - Limited in functionality i.e., they don't allow changes to their models
 - Unaffordable for average deep learning researcher or developer
 - Limited in scope i.e., they have very few models or models only in a certain sub-domain
 - Impossible/Difficult to import previous work
 ​
 Imagine a web-based drag and drop AI Development tool which allows you to:
 - import your previous models or any model on github/huggingface
 - make changes to imported models visually
 - change/add/remove any layer of neural network
 - verify neural network design by calculating input and output vector size
 - export code in tf/pytorch/onnx
 - prune and quantize deep learning models
 - train models on cloud or local machine
 - auto label data using zero shot detectors (ZSD-YOLO)
 - monitor training history and progress
 - inspect outputs and gradients of any arbitrary layer in deep learning models

I also need to protype a web dashboard for visualizing and manipulating the data to demonstrate possible ways of communicating the data and the "story" within if they made the data publicly accessible.
 I have two questions (which may have different answers):
  
How would you minimally secure (i.e. password protect, but perhaps not with a full-on authentication system) a basic (probably static, HTML/CSS/Javascript) web app in 2022?
 How do you deal with confidential/proprietary data when developing prototypes?
 (Bonus) Happen to have an example of how you tackled a similar scenario?
  
I'll edit this post as needed if clarifying questions are asked below. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking for some advice or general best practices when it comes to wrangling survey response data that consists mostly of "click all that apply" responses and then free text responses (for reference the survey was distributed through Survey Monkey). The data is structured in a wide format, wherein the possible responses for questions are distributed in the columns of the data. For example a question on race would have each of possible values for race as a column variable: 
 white <- c(white, NA, NA, white) black <- c(NA, black, NA, black) asian <- c(asian, NA, asian, NA) unique_id <- x(1,2,3) df <- tibble(white, black, asian, unique_id) 
 Each respondent's responses are captured in a single row and every respondent has a unique ID, so respondent 1 would have checked the boxes for White and Asian. My question is in regards to how best to go about formatting the data for analysis. Given that there are multiple of these "check all that apply" or dummy variable columns, is it best to leave this data in a wide format? Or is it better to gather all of these columns into a single variable and pivot the data longer? My only concern is that there are about 20 questions like this, so pivoting each of these variables would create a really long data frame. Additionally, I need to have the data formatted in a way that would require little to no preprocessing in Tableau. This is primarily due to work policies on formatting research publications and data visuals (I know it's not ideal but I can't change it). 
 I have it currently set up in two way: the first is with each question separated out in different excel sheets that can be joined by their unique ID. The second is with all the questions combined into a single data frame. Both are formatted wide. Thanks in advance for any help or advice, I can also provide additional anonymous data if that would help you help me better :)

Anything greater than one converges to infinite error as far as i can tell, and using a number less than one is the only way to actually use the information about the sensitivity of the cost function), anywhere you find a derivative less than one is going to make your change huge and probably change your weight too much… what… what am i missing here?

Cody, Reshma, and Rahul here and we’re building Medplum (https://www.medplum.com), an open-source platform that lets you quickly build complex healthcare applications. We provide a headless EHR (electronic health record) that supports common standards like FHIR, HL7 and more. You build whatever UI and UX you want, and we handle the infrastructure and give you lots of interoperability and automation tools.
The digital healthcare space has been hampered by proprietary tech, walled gardens, and vendor lock-in. Working as healthcare app developers ourselves, we kept seeing organizations developing the same infrastructure over and over. The question “how is this stuff not open source?” came up so often that we finally decided to just build it.

But nobody talks about the data analyst. The folks who write SQL for reporting, create dashboards, and provide insights. Data science does do all this in a more sophisticated way, but the reality is most tech companies or start ups do not even have an appetite for that kind of work since they are so focused on growth. If you're struggling to get into data science, consider analytics. The pay is still good (100k plus if you're doing product analytics) and a natural growth path from there can totally be data science. Don't rule it out, you have options. End 😊

        <updated>2022-11-08T16:18:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am working on curve's peaks and valleys detections.
 Peak detection function
 In Python there is no shortage of nice functions to do it like with scipy.signal.find_peaks.
 And most functions have many parameters (distance, height, prominence, etc.) which have for objective to detect more or less peaks, which mean ignoring the minor ones, considered as noise.
 Curve smoothing
 Then comes smoothing the curve before peak detecting.
 I often see it done in blogs and examples.
 The savgol_filter is quite often used.
 Basically it smooths the curves, so noise is removed and then you detect only major peaks.
 Here are my questions:
 1/ Is curve smoothing before peak detection of any use ?
 I have the intuition that it's overlapping, and basically doing twice the same thing via different means.
 And that if you fine tune your peak detection function parameters (distance, height, prominence, etc.) enough, smoothing before will never provide any upside.
 2/ If curve smoothing is useful how to optimize it with peak detection?
 Say you want to detect only visually major peaks (I know it's subjective, but let's say you want only a limited number of peaks, while maximizing the gap between peaks and valleys).
 Is there a way to find the correct mix of smoothing and parameters?
 Or do you bruteforce millions of combinaisons until you have minimized the number of peaks while maximized the average gaps between peaks and valleys? 
 What are your thoughts?
 thx

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my work as a datascientist I use a lot of blackbox algoritms such as gradient boosting, random forrest and neural networks. One question I ALWAYS get from the business I'm making the models for is, what features are important? How does the model make descicions. So to answer that I do the usual feature analysis, correlation matrices, partial dependence plots, mdi, model extraction. But I still fill like I'm not entirely able to answer what variables are the most important for example.
 Now I was thinking of a new method to determine feature importance. First we need the trained model, and the feature distributions. If we take a feature, we look at the sorted values and take 11 values corresponding to 0% - 10% - .. - 100% of the feature distribution. Next we take for example 1000 random states of the other features and test per random state the 11 options for the selected feature. For this 11 values of the feature, we check the number of times the y-value (label) changes. After doing this for all features, we should have an order of feature importance, as a higer rate of changes indicates more influence on the labels outcome. Would als be applicable for discrete variables and continuous labels with some minor adjustments.
 I love to hear your experiences in this regard and what you think of the proposed method?

        <updated>2022-11-08T13:45:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I created a system for building SVG-only websites called Svija.  But, though the content was nice, the sites felt too static — a bit flat and lifeless. Even a basic HTML website has mouseover effects, but SVG doesn't have them for free the way HTML does.
I wanted to find an easy way to recreate mouseover functionality in SVG. For my first try, I labeled objects in Adobe Illustrator:
  • linkSomeName: an invisible link  (over the link text)
  • mouseoverSomeName: a  mouseover decoration (usually bold or colored text, or an underline), initially hidden

Once I had used it for a bit, I thought that it might be nicer if the effects faded in and out. So, I tried animating the transitions with GSAP. It immediately became clear that there was enormous potential to manage complex animations visually, and I worked over the 
summer to create Svija Vibe.
It's all based on linking Adobe Illustrator object names to the GSAP script. Most basic transformations already work well but there's a lot I'll be able to do to make it even simpler to use.
I'm really excited about it! I've only just started but I have a million ideas about how to make it more capable — the big one being the ability to chain animations together.
There's a support document at https://tech.svija.love/how/animation that gives more detail about exactly what can be done.
Svija Vibe is free. It works with Svija, which is also free, but you do need to create an account to use it (Maconly, at least for the next three months).

It's a chrome extension that allows discussion on any webpage to happen there itself.
Currently I have built threaded comments, and a upvote/downvote system.
Plus I've built this cool feature called Highlights, which lets you discuss specific lines in any documentation. As well as a feature called Top Hightlights, which shows the most interesting hightlights on any webpage.
Hope you guys will try it out. And if you have any questions, feel free to ask me here.
Thanks.

 What is a "clean" or "good" code that you expect a good DS professional to hand you for production so that you don't hate him/her for it? It'd be good to get some pointers to avoid these mistakes in the future and be hated for them.
 And please don't reply "depends on the situation"; please give good generalisable advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The EDA and data cleaning part of the project is always a messy phase for me. I was wondering what practices people are doing to standardize it and make things more automated and streamlined?
 I've also been trying to make my code more extensible to avoid having to code refactor every time new things comes into play. Since its easy to go in one direction, but harder to go in the other. Keeping things more modular and abstract. I know data science is particularly not fit for some parts of these, since data cleaning is very order based, and EDA is very unplanned and prone to rabbit-holes, but i try to put up with it anyways.
 For example, I no longer do df.groupby(X), but put the key into a list like df.groupby([X]), and maybe take out that and keep it as a list variable for data abstraction. Or do things like df[df["col"].isin([X])] instead of df[df["col"]==X].
 Sure, these create awkward one-element lists at the start, but the point is that they might not end up being one-element anymore in the future. The main con is slower readability with these oxbow lake code. Sometimes my team mate tries to revert and "de-abstract" the code back and I have to explain to them why extensibility is good.

I need to create a data-driven ordering system using this data to model how many of these products the store should order at any given time.
 I'm not used to working with time series, and am rather unsure of how to approach this problem. One model I was thinking could include lag variables for amount sold of this product for the past 7 days. I'm not sure where I could take it from there.
 Appreciate any thoughts from people more expert than me on this on relatively simple methods to solve this problem. This is for a take home assignment for a job interview, and I could use ideas. Links to resources and methods would be very helpful.
