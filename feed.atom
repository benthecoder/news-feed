        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My position is titled “Analytics Manager” although I do a lot of modeling (linear reg., time series, logistic reg., clustering, etc) in my day to day for client facing business insights. My company doesn’t to a lot of hardcore ML engineering, so I don’t get a lot of exposure to that, but I do think I have a fair bit of exp. with most data science topics.
 I have some projects from a boot camp I did a few years back, although with working full time I really haven’t really had any “off the clock” meaningful projects I’d want to show off in a job interview since then (besides fiddling some GANs for image generation and some cloud storage for a Minecraft server). Is it really worth adding these old projects that may be a tad more “data-sciency” to my resume if I have a ton of on-the-job examples since (Probably can’t post recent code examples as it’s company generated work)?

 Is one harder to break into? Does one generally lead to better opportunities down the road? Is pay expected to be higher for one vs the other (I’m expecting similar based on recruiter conversation)? Is one more or less ‘future proof’?
 ​
 I think I know which one I would be a more natural fit for but I’m curious about the perception of the roles from others in the industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm guessing most of you have heard the world war II era story used to illustrate survivorship bias. If not, it's featured on the wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias
 Other than that, there are many other biases/paradoxes/pitfalls than the non-statistically minded might fall into. A decent list can be found here: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/23779/most-interesting-statistical-paradoxes/592495#592495
 Some were inspired by historical failures (e.g. the survivorship bias again) but others seem to have started more as brain teasers. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_problem
 Additional, some are fairly easy to come across (Simpson's paradox is applicable to a lot of real world data) whereas others might be more niche.
 Regardless, I would say that the thing all of these examples have in common is basically:
 There appears to be an obvious answer/interpretation, but that answer/interpretation is either not a sure thing or the correct answer/interpretation is in blatant contradiction to the obvious answer.
 By that definition, has anything like this come up on the job?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 My apologies in advance for the rookie question (as I’m a physicist)!
 I’m wondering if it’s somewhat easily possible to automate some content generation that I often must complete manually. For example, if I make an image or diagram to succinctly explain each of the physics questions at the end of a textbook chapter (ie, the text prompt), is it possible to generate mostly correct and similar images/diagrams for new input questions (assuming the training images are decently well standardized and formatted).
 I’ve kept up with the latest research that’s come out over the past several months on similar questions—I believe there has been some success with Few-Shot classification. In any case, if anyone could tell me where to look (or quit while I’m behind), it would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks!

 I recently solved a business problem at DoorDash: we needed a way to onboard new advertisers (brands that sell products at convenience/grocery stores) at scale, without having to manually identify all their products that are available on DoorDash. We used a fuzzy-matching classifier with a human in the loop.
 The part I find the most interesting is how we were able to take an out-of-the-box fuzzy matching algorithm and – with relatively little technical effort – tweak it to improve precision and recall. See table toward the end of the piece.
 Comment away, either here or on the post itself!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a project to learn "to think" about the problem in a Data Science way; this is because I've mostly done coding and usually machine learning, but nothing focused on problems, so I started one.
 ​
 In this problem, I need to figure out which companies are more likely to grow in the future by looking at some of their data which says how long they've been operating vs. how big they are. I have all this data and...I'm struggling to come up with a path ahead. A friend of mine suggested using random forests and classifying them (since it's categorical data: time being "first period, second period, etc." and their "growth" is measured as "new, middle, big") however, I am unsure how to do this. 
 ​
 I did do the random forest and got some values, but they're giving me, as expected, a result like:
 ​
 Company 1 - random forest: 0.98, growth: new, time: second_period" 
 Which...upon looking at it, means nothing to me. I'm unsure about how to go about doing this, I used to do this a few years ago, but ever since I moved to language models and other such things, I feel like I'm super rusty and not even sure where to go from here...could you please help me out? At least how should I be thinking about the problem

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have weather data from stations across the US but of course this data corresponds to single lat/lon coordinates whereas I'd like data at every coordinate across the entire US. Thus, I'm going to need to do some sort of spatial interpolation (or similar).
 I've read that krigging (Gaussian Process Regression) is often used for spatial interpolation though I can't see the benefit over something like KNN if I'm not going to be using the uncertainty estimate it comes with. Krigging is very computationally expensive and explaining the theory behind it is difficult at best. Neglecting uncertainty quantification since it won't be used, is the main advantage properly designed mean and covariance functions in which the model reverts back to in the areas far from data points?

Stuff like cool libraries, updated laws and regulations about handling data, and other cool stuff. It’s something that’ll help me learn and add value to a community that’s been really helpful to me. So what kind of stuff do you want to see more of here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been out of programming practice and not feeling very motivated for building something real, so I’m looking for programming games that are fun. I’ve tried a few, I think I’d like something that has a REPL or notebook interface as well as or instead of a file-based interface.
Here are some I’ve tried:
Using a general-purpose programming language:
bitburner - this is quite fun, though there’s quite a lot going on
hackmud - this seems fun and interesting, though the community is small now. This was my introduction to JS dependency hell.
Special purpose languages:
The many Zach-likes - I’ve enjoyed these a lot, but I want something a bit more open than puzzle-y
Else.heart.break - This was quite fun, but a very slow start and then I broke the quest triggers by skipping right to the end of the game once I got the hacking device.
colobot a cool classic educational programming game where you’re an astronaut controlling lots of robots - I remember the missions feeling a lot easier to solve without much programming, but apparently there’s a new mission pack…
Anyway! Interested to hear your recommendations!]]></summary>

 I've just been admitted to IT Masters Degree course with Data Science specialization, but from what I can see in the curriculum, there is not much math involved over the 2 years the programme goes on.
 Hence my question - do you know any comprehensive online stats courses focusing on math? Could be expensive ones (eg. if Harvard offers any relevant classes), that's not an issue - I just need some truly reliable source that can supplement my uni studies in the long run.

 Given full training session (15-20 minutes) wearable sensors time-series data (accelerometer, etc.), identify the "moment" when a specific test was performed. The test can be a combination of activities: sit2stand+walk+stand2sit or walk+turn+walk+turn or something similar. Obviously, duration can be different, but the test is present within the session. Walking detection model is available, there is some training data, but not excessive amounts. I am just trying to see what the best approach would be? I am thinking about training a convolutional NN with short window size of 1/2 sec to detect each required test element and then see where they best align together. Also how to deal with the fact if the model doesn't find such a test, but it certainly was done?

 I released v0.0.2 of neograd, a deep learning framework created from scratch using Python and NumPy, with automatic differentiation capabilities. I’d taken for granted that I understood how convolutions work. Just implement a sliding window, perform element-wise multiplication, take its sum, sounds so simple right? Add to that - accounting for the running time of the algorithm, backward pass to get its gradients and convolutions over volumes, this turned out to be an excruciating undertaking.
 This release includes:- Gradient checking to check the correctness of gradients that are calculated by autograd- Optimization algorithms like Momentum, RMSProp, and Adam- 2D, 3D Convolution and 2D, 3D Pooling layers for Convolutional Neural Networks- Save trained models, weights to dis…]]></summary>

 Frankly I wouldn’t mind this if the people asking had done some cursory research beforehand and asked politely, but it seems like every jerkoff who’s caught a whiff of an Excel spreadsheet thinks they can land a FAANG job overnight and, instead of looking on Google for “how to data job pls to help” and seeing the ten trillion useless Medium articles made by the endless morons trying to resume pad and slip their jimmy into an Amazon L3 role that would tell them practically everything they need to know (even if by and large anything posted on Medium is worthless) they choose to pepper subs like /r/dataengineering, /r/dataanalysis, and this one with the same “how to data job please give me six figures” - it’s like asking /r/personalfinance “help how do I own a bank account” repeated for every hapless schmuck who’s been hiding their Benjamins in granny’s cookie tin for the last sixteen years of their childhood. 
 Not even getting into the fact that doing basic research on the topic at hand is probably the fundamental skill for any data-whatever role, what’s even funnier is that I’d hazard a guess that most of us who actually work in the industry have better things to do during the day, so the people answering questions are probably majority kids trying to get their first data-whatever job - blind leading the blind all over again. 
 TLDR: Screw you guys I’m going to /r/Statistics

Let's say I have data on 100 students and their 100 most recent test scores (assuming that each test is the same across all students and of varying difficulty successively), and I want to understand what kind of exponential smoothing value is optimal to predict each student's next test score.
 Because there must be some information contained within the population's overall performance across tests, I want to leverage that. But am I able to do so using something like R's forecast package's ETS function? I know that it can handle a single-subject time series but how can it assess the overall alpha value given 100 subjects?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My goal is to learn hypothesis testing. My understanding is that we do not have the population data. Therefore, we do not know the estimated population mean. So, we guess the population mean. If that so, can we change the population mean until the p-value is below 0.05, so we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis?
 The code ``` import pandas as pd from scipy import stats
 sample = pd.Series([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])
 Hypothesis Testing:
 H0: μ <= 3.5 (previously it was μ <= 5.5,
 then 5, then 4.5, I change it until I get p value less than 0.05)
 H1: μ > 3.5
 t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_1samp(a = sample, popmean=3.5, alternative="greater")
 print("sample mean:", sample.mean()) print("t-statistic: {0:.2f} p-value: {1:.2f}".format(t_stat, p_value))
 print("since we do not have the population data, " "popmean=3.5 is not meaningful, " "we can change it until we get enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis")
 print("critical value: 5%, therefore confidence interval: 90%")
 print("because p-value is below 0.05, we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. " "therefore, we can conclude that the mean population is more than 3.5")
 print("population standard deviation {0:.2f}".format(sample.std(ddof=0)))
 print("if we imagine the sample as the weight of waste, the conclusion is, " "90% of population data is between population mean + 3 * population standard deviation, " "in this case 3.5 +- 3 * 2.87") ```

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm just going to make up an example here. Imagine you want to predict a stock price. Your feature is today's price and your target is tomorrow's price. 
 Here would be a simple case: Feature = [100, 105, 110, 115, 120...] Target = [105, 110, 115, 120, 125...]
 Are we allowed to do cross validation on this? 
 Even though we are never using future data to predict the past, I still feel like cross validation should not be allowed in this case. Better approaches would be a walk-forward validation or a rolling window validation. 
 Am I correct in my assumption that cross validation should not be allowed?

Now let's say I have millions of such sequences of varying length (might be 1 term, might be 1000) and some of them are 'bad'. But their combination matters toward that badness. So I'm baselining and looking for outliers, which should have a high correlation with 'bad' in my dataset. Term might indicate 'badness' in one combination but is totally benign in another.
 So that's our search-space and problem statement. I am not educated in DS. But I understand the basic idea: Correlate traits and relationships of features in one or more data-sets to answer a question / solve a problem. But which features to select?
