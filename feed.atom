        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. Does anybody knows how XGBoost treats missing values in the Y dataset when a model is trained? I know it handles well missing values in the independent variables but I have not found what happens if there are some in the Y dataset. I am doing several regression models and it seems to work fine but dont quite understand yet if the NaN rows are excluded automatically or if the training of the model is affected in some way. There are just a few NaNs by the way (less than 5%)
 Thanks a lot
