        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw recently a lot of roadblocks that we thought AI will struggle with (Like making art) have easier crossed even with the narrow AI (ML) we have. 
 I feel a lot of limits we thought ai might have like thinking outside the box, understanding concepts, self-awareness, or lacking a 'soul' are all kinda subjective that can be overcome with the invention of AGI and ASI in the coming decades. Then they will grow behind human comprehension.
 So are there actual hard limitations (if any) Ais will encounter that are actually very hard or maybe never able to overcome?

But the thing is, all these three giants (Apple, Amazon and Google) have their incredible voice assistances. They do similar job of finding a different requested results on web etc. Apple is already adding new health support features. Google maps might make it more helpful for searches related to geographical regions. And again they probably have more user data from millions of users.
 What make it so different from them and how difficult it would be for them to create their own version as they have a lot more resources and data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm considering getting a post grad credential from the list in the title and looking for input from others who have done/are doing similar. 
 My Background: BS in Mgmt, Concentration Info Sys; UT MBA, Concentration IM/Tech Strategy. I'm late career (mid 50), have been in high tech (HW) about 25 years and want to work another 4-7. After that I would consult til tired. 
 Currently facing tech layoff and looking, but no immediate financial pressure for 1 - 2 years. 
 Programs I'm considering:
  
Newly announced UT Masters in AI. Would likely do an AI cert in the meanwhile or assumed pre-reqs (coding, linear algebra). Sounds technical and not sure I'd get accepted. est. ~2 years to complete.
 GT Masters in Analytics, with a few added AI courses. Would likely play catchup on the Micromasters to get that out of the way. est. ~2 years to complete.
 IBM or UT AI Cert and other as needed. 6-9 mos to complete.
  
Likely would need a Udemy in Python coding in all 3 cases. For those who have done, or looked at doing, any of these, what would you do/do differently? 
 All input welcome. Thanks!

I was checking this coursera degree in data science and I want to know if it's a good option to pursue since I want to have work while studying for a graduate degree. so my questions are the following:
 is the degree worth it?
 can I find a FAANG job after getting this degree or at least in a niche start-up? I know it needs extra work but would it help, my current university is in eastern Europe.
 I gladly want to hear about the experience of people who enrolled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I've watched a few tutorials on topic modeling in Python, with some open source libraries (gensim, spacy, etc). What I want to be able to do is tag a large group of reviews (such as yelp reviews) with one or more appropriately named topics. In the above mentioned tutorials I see the results as clusters that contain common terms, but I don't yet see how to go about adding an appropriate name to these clusters, and then ultimately assigning this name, or tag, back to individual reviews. How do I get from the initial analysis (LDA or what have you), to actually tagging a review with one or more appropriate categories? For example, a review talking about how expensive a hamburger is, might get assigned a "price" tag/category. Maybe LDA isn't the right method? Thanks for your tips and/or recommended tutorials!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First off, I want to say I know close to nothing about data science and I'm kinda learning on my own.
 Here's my project: I have a bunch of logs where people write statuses of different tasks and I want to identify was was done and what is left to do.
 ​
 For example, I can have logs that say:
 "X was replaced and need inspection"
 What would you do to identify that X was replaced and that X still need to be inspected?
 ​
 Also, the logs contains lots of abbreviations like:
 "X was RP and nd inspect"
 How do you deal with this?
 ​
 Any help would be greatly appreciated! TIA!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a problem where I'm looking at API calls and downstream impact. Not really a specific question to answer, but predicting performance of the calls based on path through the audit trail would be interesting to do. Or, anomaly detection (i.e, this API is defective in 10% of transactions) 
 I have thought of two approaches. One of them is regarding the data contained within the request/response payloads. The issue is, it's all text based, or changes depending on the specific API, so the data transformation aspect is very tough. Encoding one API's response to compare to a different API's response would be challenging. Perhaps there is an opportunity for deep learning here. 
 The other approach I'm thinking about, is treating this as a graph problem. The majority of these transactions will form a tree-like structure, but some of them don't have a true root, so its more of a directed, acyclic graph (think it's called a polytree?). My approach would be to use graph theory principals such as degrees, closeness, vertex distance, etc. as features instead of parsing the very dynamic payloads. Since these are rules-based systems, I would love to be able to model the underlying relationships between these calls, that way when one transaction chain doesn't match the model, it's likely an anomaly. 
 Does this make sense to do? Has anyone here done something similar? Any recommended literature? I've tried googling it, but when you search "machine learning approach to tree-based systems", you get a lot of papers or articles referencing tree-based ML models, which is not exactly what I'm looking for yet. Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on an AI project and looking for an open-source text2music or text2audio model that I can incorporate into a website to experiment with. I'm aware of models like MusicLM and VALL-E but those haven't been released as APIs yet. I've also come across AudioGen and Mousai but same issues there.
 Does anyone happen to have a suggestion for a text2music model that is OSS and fairly accessible to incorporate into a web app? Looking for the best OSS model out there, but also open to the best text2audio that anyone would recommend - just looking to get text2audio working. Any suggestions from prior experience would be hugely helpful. 
 Thanks very much in advance!

 Hey everyone, I recently made a course about ChatGPT as a fun passion project. This is for anyone who wants to learn how to create automated workflows (using Chrome extensions) with ChatGPT. Specifically, you will create a ChatGPT bot that automatically answers your emails. It is beginner friendly and includes getting some good practice with JavaScript. I hope you enjoy it and I'm looking forward to your feedback/questions :)

 The Scenario:
  
Assume you were to look at the historical performance of several widget makers who manually produce widgets. These widget makers could be active employees at present or left at some point during the window.
 You want to compare the historical performance of the widget makers in terms of defect rate over the last 5 years (2018-2022). My definition of defect rate is simply the total number of d…]]></summary>

 % Convert linear indices to (x, y, z) coordinates

For first round I got project to do at home (company really liked the results). Not really sure what to prepare next or even how many rounds there will be. Any suggestions on what to shift my focus to for next interview? It will be held by current data scientists of the firm. 
 This is my first interview for position of data scientist so i don't really know how it goes, any tips or guidance would be appriciated. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am teaching a course on Big Data starting next week and had planned a project with the twitter API for exercising spark structured streaming. Of course, that might be rather difficult now. So I am wondering if there is a similar alternative to get a stream of text using an api which is either saved in a directory or kafka. I have mostly found examples where you would have to poll continuously like facebook. 
 Any ideas? Thanks!

I know that these 4 variables decline over time and have a relationship with the other dependent variables. So I want to predict these 4 variables and their trend for the next year. Obviously I do not have the data for the dependent variables over next year. Any ideas on how to start? I built an LSTM model to predict the 4 variables already but it needs of course the dependent variables as input for next year.

Did you or someone you know enroll in the program?
 What was your admission stats like?
 How long did it take for the decision to arrive?
 What kind of job opportunities came up after finishing the program?
 Would you recommend the program to others who are already data scientists?
  
Any info or thoughts you have would be awesome. Thanks!
