        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm stuck on a problem and I just don't even know where to start. I need to run another, non-linear model on the residuals from a linear model. Using scikit-learn in python. But I'm not sure what the right workflow is for this? Do I make a new class? If so, what should it inherit from? Or should I put them both in a pipeline? How can I tell the second model to use the residuals from the first?
 Any help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like probably many of you, I'm kind of a perfectionist coder/creator. Recently I'd been bookmarking interesting dark mode sites just because I liked their aesthetic, and because for some of the SaaS I want to make, I wanted to make it dark mode first rather than light mode like most sites, so I was looking for inspiration.
I'd amassed around 20-30 and I told my friends about these cool sites yesterday. They mentioned that me linking to each one was kind of annoying and they wanted to see all of them at once, similar to how Awwwards and other web design inspiration directories worked. I thought a making a dark mode directory was a great idea as I could just link one site to my friends rather than bombarding them with links.
I'd previously worked on other projects but I always spent too long…]]></summary>

 I interned at JPMC this past summer, and I did enjoy the challenging problems I got to solve at JPMC. At the same time, I don't want to stay in the realms of banking. 
 Aside from location being a very important aspect for me to consider, I'm also wondering about early career growth and marketability for when I look for another job in the future. Does anyone have any advice?

 But if there are DA, DS and ML roles in this field that you are aware of, could you please point me towards those? And what skills do I need to polish to prepare for such roles in your opinion? And also, if you have any such open roles in your company, I'm open for DMs. Thanks!

I built and launched Sendfly for myself 5 years ago and it's been a rock solid service that I've relied on ever since.
Recently I've done a full re-write, simplifying the product and making it super affordable. I wanted to share it here in case it comes in handy for someone else.
There are lots of competitors out there but I found them too expensive for my needs. For $15/year you get unlimited forms and 5,000 form submissions every year. Hoping that fits the bill for developers like me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought of a question that I would like to clarify with your help.
 Example: I am creating a machine learning model with precipitation as the dependent and meteorological data such as temperature, barometric pressure, clouds as independent variables (it's just an example...). But now I am interested in what were the conditions (of the independent variables) when it rained. Is there a method which can show this, meaning detect the conditions of a given event (in a time series)?
 e.g. it only rains when the temperatur was between 20°C-25°C, pressure was xy and there were clouds (I know it doesn't make sense but it's just about to make a example)

I’ve worked with crm databases and excel analytics with VLOOKUPs and pivot tables for 3 years now and want to get into a data analyst type job. What’s the next step for me to go from excel analytics into a data analyst position? Would I benefit from a Boot Camp that teaches SQL? Should I be looking for an entry level data analyst position?
 I’m feeling very direction less so I really appreciate any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been doing Regression (various linear, non linear, logistic), Clustering, Segmentation/Classification, Association, Neural Nets etc for 15 years since I first started.
 Back then the industry just called it Statistics. Then they changed it to Analytics. Then the branding changed to Data Science. Now they call it AI and Machine Learning.
 I get it, we're now doing things more at scale, bigger datasets, more data sources, more demand for DS, automation, integration with software etc, I just find it interesting that the labeling/branding for essentially the same methodologies have changed over the years.

 I'm coming back to my data project after a 4 month long hiatus and have gotten very rusty. I am using Kaggle to host my R project. Is there a way for me to save my project as a draft without up-versioning after each save? Reason being, I don't want my project to have 15+ versions by the time it is complete.
 Thanks!

For context, I applied for a Data Science scholarship and as part of the deliberation, we need to do a case study using the datasets from Spotify Daily Charts, Spotify Daily Charts Artists, Spotify Daily Charts Tracks and generate a cohesive analysis based on the topics assigned to us (situational). 
 I really want to learn and career shift in Data Science, I'm just a little lost right now as I came from a different background (Engineering — basically a novice in DS). 
 Any insights on what to search, how to start, and tips on making your analysis would be greatly appreciated!

I have solicited interest from a number of recruiters, but I want to time my exit right so it doesn't look too bad for my career or resume.
 So I'm a Data Scientist with under a year of experience and am also a new grad from a really good DS program. I got offered a job at a really good company (well at least reputation-wise), so everyone thinks that they pay well. The truth is that they don't pay well at all, especially for entry-level talent. People who graduate from my program make good money too, like low to mid 100s on average according to school reports. I was a pretty good student too,…]]></summary>

I'm currently using pixel wise CE loss. However, I want to use the euclidean distance of the coordinates along with the current loss function to see if the accuracy improves. 
 To get the coordinates from the heatmaps, argmax function is commonly used. Since argmax is not differentiable, I cannot use it in a loss function. Is there any workaround for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So just a little background, I graduated last year and got into a data science internship at one of the biggest banks in my country, as you can imagine, as as intern I'm getting paid next to nothing. My internship ends in December and I think they're most likely going to offer me an extension on my contract but it'll be based on the same pay and to be honest I'm doing really tedious work, nothing remotely related to proper data science. 
 I got into data science purely because of my love for solving problems and anything number related so i decided to take a look at a few Strategy Consultant roles because after reading what they do it intrigued me. Fast forward 2 months and i got an offer from PwC as a Strategy Consultant within their Strategy& team ... the pay is almost 10× more, the benefits are amazing and it means i get to travel a bit more. And again, the work genuinely intrigues me. 
 Sounds great but for the longest time my heart has been on data science and suddenly I'm in this position where I'm offered either to tough it out as an intern with next to no money for another year with the hopes of being absorbed as permanent or join PwC as a Strategy Consultant and finally make a living for myself ? 
 Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated.

 This is my first time posting something on this channel and the question that I am asking might not be appropriate (In that case, I apologise and please ignore my stupid question.). Also, my understanding on git strategy and philosophy may be slightly limited so if you spot something stupid, please let me know! :)
 ​
 TLDR:
  
Do you prefer monorepo or polyrepo for data analytics team?
 If you have any personal experience, insights on this, please share yours with me 🥹
  
​
 Background of this question:
  
Currently, we have multiple different teams (e.g., Data Science, Pricing, and etc.) working on numerous data & analytical modelling projects. And for the Python code management, we are using a single repository under the principle of `monorepo`.
 On this single repository,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 Have anyone taken up freelance gigs? I just got an offer and i would like to streamline the process. 
 So, i have a friend who is a Graphic Designer. She has this questionnaire prepared whenever she is approached for a freelance gig. Stuff like colour theme, vision of the organization, etc. 
 I was wondering if any of you have dealt with clients as such and if a questionaire like this exists for data scientists?
 If not, what would be the important questions that i should ask the client, to streamline the process for me. (And more importantly, not sound like an idiot)
 My call is scheduled for tomorrow, so any and all suggestions are very very welcome. 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am a school teacher and we are talking a bit about AI now.
 I have told them about the concept of fake people being generated by AI and creation of non-existent people.
 I was wondering if there was any online apps (free) that one could feed images to that will aid in the detection of whether the people are real or the image is generated by a GAN?
 Thanks for your help!
