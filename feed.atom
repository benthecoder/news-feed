I call this out because I'm reading many people complaining about being a Data Scientist. My only problem is how I get a remote job for +60K. I'm looking into LinkedIn and many other sources and have no luck, I'm not living in the US neither Europe which makes it harder. I really would appreciate if someone has advises about web pages I could use to find remote DS jobs or anything that could help me.

 (I see that there was a post on deepnote a while back, but didn't see anything on Hex.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say I have multiple autocorrelation plots (one for each NFL team) can I combine them via averaging to infer autocorrelation scores across all teams? Or is this the incorrect way to do multiclass autocorrelation, if so what is the correct way? My goal is to see if future performance correlates with past performance but there are multiple groups with independent data, some of the groups show significant autocorrelation but I want to know as a whole if they correlate. From the figure below Is is correct to infer that past performance does not correlate with future results by simply averaging all traces?
 Description: each color is a different team, black line is averaged autocorrelation index for all teams at that time step, solid and dashed gray lines are 95% and 99% confidence bands.

As with technology as a whole in civilization, AI is progressing faster and could progress much faster than we can acclimate. By handing off the bureaucratic reigns of things like content curation, job/school admissions, phone service call centers, among other societal functions to AI, we will depersonalize and dehumanize the workings of human civilization for the sake of "efficiency" and "productivity".
 Think about it this way, if you're born in the age of AI in lower to middle class, you grow up with the same cohort of people.

However, my colleagues and I often disliked it, especially due to how the agile development nature of software development does not fit in with the experimental nature of data science/ML. 
 Do you guys use JIRA or alternative software to organize and manage workflows? If so, what are they, and how successful have they been? What parts of Jira do you specifically dislike?

 My training data is N (large number) of instances, wherein each I have the data recorded at the node level. In each instance, I have the same graph, but different data at nodes. In each instance, I have some (assume random) nodes that are not recorded (missing data).
 My goal is to build a network that would impute the missing data at the level of the node (Imagine – 5 nodes graphs, where only 3 nodes are actually measured, and the goal is to predict the data for the other 2 nodes). I am, so far, failing to find an example of such a problem.
 Any suggestions would be great, thank you.

 OPEN AI GPT Answer: https://beta.openai.com/playground
 [The federal government, local government, mining industry, and environmental advocates are already collaborating to support the mining and processing of rare earth metals in the United States. The U.S. Department of Energy has established a Rare Earths Supply Chain Technology and Critical Materials Institute to research, develop, and deploy materials processing technologies and systems. In addition, the Energy Department has funded research projects to explore the potential for domestic rare earths production. The U.S. Geological Survey is also involved in researching the potential for domestic rare earths production. The mining industry has also been actively involved in exploring the potential for domestic rare earths production. The American Exploration & Mining Association has established a Rare Earths Task Force to study the issue and provide recommendations. Environmental advocates have been working with the government and industry to ensure that any domestic rare earths production is done responsibly. Several environmental groups have expressed support for domestic rare earths production, as long as it is done in a sustainable manner. ]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I need some help. I am doing a project in ML, and I have some questions.
 I have a training dataset and a test dataset. I don't have the target column in the test dataset. Therefore, I planed the following experience:
  
Split the training dataset into 70 (x_train) - 30 (x_validation) 
 Using cross-validation over the x_train, select the best parameters for every type of model
 Train each model only with its best parameters over the x_train dataset and select the best overall model by comparing the predictions with the x_validation
 
 Train the best overall model with the training dataset (before the split) and make predictions for the test dataset 
 This time, I do not use cross-validation.
 
  
What do you think? Am I doing it right?
 I saw a lot of stuff online but could not draw any conclusions. 
 Thanks

 -I feel this especially applies to us who are mid/late career (mid 30s-mid 40s age bracket).
 -Be interested to hear from others of their career decisions - both who stayed in 'lower' positions and those who climbed to a 'higher' position. Experience? Outcomes? Worth it?...

I had an analytics engineering internship over the summer, and now I'm currently working on my AWS architecture skills to make a thorough end-to-end project showcasing my skills. Assuming that I can get a job as a data scientist, how much would a master's in math help my career? I'm looking at possibly returning to my alma mater for it and would start next fall. If I get a job, perhaps I would do it and the masters concurrently. Would love any advice and perspectives on this!

There's almost no context for any of these facts, so I don't really know what they're used for and why I need to know them, making it more difficult to remember what I read.
 Am I missing something? Do people actually learn from this book? Or is it meant to be part of a course with an instructor to provide context?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a background in chemistry, but I haven't found it to be a satisfying career, and I'm considering transitioning to data science. I lack the statistical and coding background needed for data science so I am looking at bootcamps. 
 I am aware of the free ones like Coursera and FreeCodeCamp, but I am considering the paid bootcamps as 1) I tend to study better and faster in a non-self-taught environment and 2) I will need support in building a portfolio and finding a job, which many bootcamps offer. 
 Naturally, I don't expect to become Lead Data Scientist at Google after 3-6 months of learning a new subject, but I'd want to know there is a good job success rate for newbies after doing a bootcamp. 
 If anyone has been in a similar position, was a bootcamp certificate good enough for you to get hired? If so, what else should I be looking for in a bootcamp? I'm based in Canada and I'm considering KnowledgeHut - does anyone have any experience with them? 
 Thanks!

 I’m an experienced data scientist (6+ years of experience), graduate degree, working remote, making 150-200k/year, and I hate my job. 
 I work 20-40 hours/week making dashboards, models, building data pipelines, and talking with business stakeholders. Sometimes I’ll just leave and go to the gym for an hour midday, then come back. Or take a nap.
 I’m just so bored. Data Science was cool at my first job, lost some sheen at my second, and now I just don’t care about it. It’s so boring. I don't get any excitement out of doing linear algebra, or coding, or solving problems, as everything is so formulaic after my first two jobs. I couldn't care less about following newer model architectures because that <5% improvement means nothing for my results 99% of the time when it comes to corporate results. Plus I value my time away from work.
 Is anyone else in the same boat? Or at least has been and got out of it — because I’d love to know how you got out of it if so.
 I don't think it's because I work remote, because I hate driving and going into the office. I don't think it's my company either because I actually like my coworkers and I'm given probably too much leeway with how to do things.
 All I want to do is farm plants, grow mushrooms, and do things outside all day.
 Throw away account because I know my manager uses Reddit

 Abstract
 Natural image matting is a fundamental and challenging computer vision task. It has many applications in image editing and composition. Recently, deep learning based approaches have achieved great improvements in image matting. However, most of them require a user supplied trimap as an auxiliary input, which limits the matting applications in the real world. Although some trimap-free approaches have been proposed, the matting quality is still unsatisfactory compared to trimap-based ones. Without the trimap…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a forecasting problem, which involves predicting traffic between points in a logistics system. The problem has a number of cyclical aspects (day-of-week, and surges during certain months of the year). I want to do some testing to find out whether adding in extra variables will help, and which methods (ARIMA, TBATS, etc.) work best. 
 My problem is the amount of data is gigantic, and I'm looking for the best way to test models using a workable subset of the data. The easiest way to subset the data would be to limit the time period, for example, just taking November and December from two consecutive years, and treat the last two weeks of December as the "test" data -- hold it out, ask the model to forecast what it should be, and then compare those results to the actual values. 
 An alternative, which would be much harder to prepare the data for, would be to look at a subset of the points geographically -- for example, just look at traffic between a very limited number of endpoints.
 My question is, would forecasting methods work properly if the time span in the data set has gaps in it? Or should I go to the trouble of subsetting the cities involved?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our Hosting provider, Hetzner, has recently started charging for public IPv4 addresses - as they should! Those numbers started getting expensive. This prompted me to try and set up a new server cluster using IPv6 exclusively, and see how far I could get before having to give in and purchase an additional v4 address.
The experiment ended much sooner than I had anticipated. Some of the road blocks I hit along the way:
  - The GitHub API and its code load endpoints are not reachable via IPv6, making it impossible to download release artefacts from many projects, lots of which distribute their software via GitHub exclusively (Prometheus for instance).
  - The default Ubuntu key servers aren't reachable via IPv6, making it difficult to install packages from third-party registries, such as Docker or Grafana. While debugging, I noticed huge swaths of the GPG infrastructure are defunct: There aren't many key servers left at all, and the only one I found actually working via IPv6 was pgpkeys.eu.
  - BitBucket cannot deploy to IPv6 hosts, as pipelines don't support IPv6 at all. You can self-host a pipeline runner and connect to it via v6, BUT it needs to have a dual stack - otherwise the runner won't start.
  - Hetzner itself doesn't even provide their own API via IPv6 (which we talk to for in-cluster service discovery. Oh, the irony.

        <id>https://lobste.rs/s/hbuvr2</id>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full Abstract from PDF:
Metadata updates, such as file creation and block allocation, have consistently been identified
as a source of performance, integrity, security, and availability problems for file systems. Soft
updates is an implementation technique for low-cost sequencing of fine-grained updates to
write-back cache blocks. Using soft updates to track and enforce metadata update dependen-
cies, a file system can safely use delayed writes for almost all file operations. This article
describes soft updates, their incorporation into the 4.4BSD fast file system, and the resulting
effects on the system. We show that a disk-based file system using soft updates achieves
memory-based file system performance while providing stronger integrity and security guar-
antees than most disk-based file systems. For workloads that frequently perform updates on
metadata (such as creating and deleting files), this improves performance by more than a
factor of two and up to a factor of 20 when compared to the conventional synchronous write
approach and by 4 –19% when compared to an aggressive write-ahead logging approach. In
addition, soft updates can improve file system availability by relegating crash-recovery
assistance (e.g., the fsck utility) to an optional and background role, reducing file system
recovery time to less than one second.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve applied to 120-something jobs so far, got a few interviews, and then never make it to the next round. I have research experience from my university, but no internship experience.
 I genuinely really love doing anything that is involved with data. I’ve even recently self-taught Tableau and SQL to create 2 projects for my portfolio. Other than that, I have worked with large datasets, and know Python (Numpy, Pandas, RegEx), Stata (worked with ML too), MATLAB, SAS, and of course Excel (power query and pivoting).
 Am I missing something? I feel really burnt out.
 PS: I know “Junior” is a term used for software engineer, but does that also apply to DA and DS? I’ve noticed how all the job postings want at least 2+ years of experience.

 I'd like to introduce PP-LiteSeg, a novel model for the real-time semantic segmentation task. 
 PP-LiteSeg achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and speed compared to other methods.
 Hope this be some help to you.
 Arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02681
 Source code and models: https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg
 The comparison of accuracy and speed on the Cityscapes test set.
 PP-LiteSeg adopts the encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight network is used as an encoder to extract hierarchical features. The Simple Pyramid Pooling Module (SPPM) is in charge of aggregating the global context. The Flexible Decoder (FLD) predicts the outcome by fusing detail and semantic features from high level to low level. In addition, FLD makes use of the Unified Attention Fusion Module (UAFM) to strengthen feature representations.
 The architecture overview of PP-LiteSeg.
 The framework of Unified Attention Fusion Module (UAFM), which can utilize spatial and channel attention module.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So guys, i've been lately reading about Rotation Forest algorithm and i learned that it uses PCA in order to reduce the feature space and it also uses a decision tree as base classifier. The authors stated that it is possible to replace PCA with other Dimensionality Reduction algorithms and also replace Decision Tree with any other classifier. My question is, what really happens inside Rotation Forest when replacing PCA with a Feature Selection Algorithm such as Random Subset Feature Selection (RSFS). Unfortunately, i cannot seem to find any useful information about this matter.

 When the whole Lensa AI “Magic Avatars” based on Subtle Diffusion took Instagram by storm and I started doing my research and got hooked. I’ve dallied with DALE but found the true temptation in GPT3.5
 Of course, GPT3.5 and ChatGPT just came out, and while ChatGPT is great for most conversational stuff… GPT3.5 is a powerhouse.
 It is so extremely dynamic. I fed it an 1820’s family’s household budget and it was able to generate the price of 77 items back in that time period.That’s a very specific topic I’m sure I’ve tried to google at least twenty times before and had never found such quantity and at such speed as GPT3.5 can. It cuts through so much bullshit…]]></summary>

 So I have been on the job hunt and I've been applying to a few companies (in India for context) for the roles of DS/DA, and even some BA (depending on the JD). I've heard back from a few, and even had late-stage interviews as well with many.
 Out of all of them, one company, a relatively large healthcare-based company interviewed me, and the interviewer (in the 3rd round) asked me, among many other things, data structures and algorithms questions... stacks and queues etc. 
 Just wanted the community's opinion on: 1. Do you guys face this too in your region? 2. Experienced DS/DA: do you guys use advanced DSA topics at any time? 3. Do you think its worth learning DSA for data science?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I won't post proof here for fear of letting it out, but I was able to bypass ChatGPI's AI security protocols, revealing plans for a Research Grade Nuclear Reactor. The plans give specifics about elements, measurements, temperatures, pressure, materials, software/hardware requirements, and instructions to build the aforementioned. It also explains concepts in terms that most High School Seniors could probably understand. Obviously, I would never use these and it would be practically impossible to anyway, but if I can basically obtain instructions for this, imagine what others could find out plans for. I've purged all of this information and mean no harm but wanted to raise the issue to prevent others who aren't like me. I'm also hesitant to explain how I did this out of fear that others may misuse it, but the moderators can message me and I will provide proof.

 Edit 1: Title should read "... - Precedent is Dangerous"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Reddit, 
 A few months ago I converted old Hi-8 cassette tapes to digital format, and I had the intention of splitting the footage, but I quickly came to the realisation how monotonous this task was going to be so I put it off, but recently I’ve been blown away by the advancements in AI Technology and I came to the conclusion that there might be an AI video splitter for something like this.
 So my question is, there any AI video editors that could do such a thing? 
 If there is it would be brilliant! Thanks in advance!
