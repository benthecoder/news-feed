        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm trying to create a basic search engine. My goal is to create an API endpoint where the client sends a query (Any string) and I turn into a TF-IDF vector after some minor pre-processing. I then want to compute cosine similarity against all other vectors and return the top k similar ones. 
 Did anyone attempt this before? Should I be using Sagemaker to run the vectorizer + cosine similarity? Do I have to load these vectorizers everytime I have to infer something? 
 Any resources or tips would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having a hard time deciding between the two positions, and would like some opinions on what would set me on the best path to enter a FAANG or Unicorns in the future. Both roles are Data Scientist.
 Remote position: 75k base, standard benefits + bonus based on performance
 Pros:
 - Remote will allow me to work in MCOL area and save a lot of money
 - Additional bonuses if I get professional certifications (which are resume boosters as well)
 Cons:
 - Small, no name company, niche (and imo boring) domain
 ​
 Boston position: 100k base, 2k relocation, some start-up stock
 Pros:
 - Interesting product, everyone I spoke to are very passionate about it
 - The people there have amazing educational and industry backgrounds, and I think I'll learn a lot from them
 Cons:
 - HCOL and I have to find a place fast, everything is expensive and Boston is cold
 - Based on the current state of the start up I might not have any WLB
 ​
 If anyone would like to give some advice and thought that would be appreciated as well. I feel that the remote position is safe and within my comfort zone, while the start up is risky but would definitely push me out of my comfort zone.

 I work as a software developer, and mostly I code in Python (lately I started to code in JS), but I'm really interested in data science. So my question is, can I get practical experience in data science without a powerful computer? Unfortunately, I don't have one, but maybe there are some online clouds with huge databases that I can use for learning projects, or maybe there are some other alternative temporary solutions for me?
 I'll be very thankful for any resources and advices on that matter!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been following the AI art debate a little. AI has always bothered me a little over the years. I've always had two questions:
 For advocates:
 1.) How do you believe humans will find meaning as AI continues to be able to do more and more things that humans once did?
 Maybe there is some ideal that people will be free to do whatever they want. But I think deriving value from "personal projects" only goes so far. I think humans flourish when we are actually needed as integral parts of a community. Just doing things for ourselves will become an empty pursuit quickly. It's hard for me to see how we don't end up in a world like in Wall-E, except the real life version has a lot more suicides. 
 2.) What is your ultimate goal/hope with this stuff?
 To me it has always seemed like a lot of the technology has been motivated by nothing more than, "we just wanted to see if we could do it". Which feels pretty irresponsible. I'm sure I'm off here. But I'm thinking of the IBM computer that beat a chess master. Or the art AI software. What value does that really add except, "Hey bro wouldn't it be so cool if all I had to do was type what kind of picture I wanted, and it would appear on screen?"
 That is all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we all know, Python is used in different ways by software and data engineers and computer and data scientists. The language is still the same, but the specifics change, as well as the tools and techniques one learns and uses.
 I think it's somewhat similar to learning another language. In both cases you're still learning Spanish, but someone who learns it because his girlfriend is Colombian may do it differently than someone who learns it because he'll live in Colombia for 3 months.
 In the first case, the person may want to learn intimate dialogue sooner, whereas the other person might ignore those and focus more on small talk and conversations they expect to partake in as a tourist.
 So, with that in mind, my question is, do you think learning Python should be done in a similar way for us? I'm not even asking about learning from scratch, mind you, but more someone who wants to go from "Beginner with a couple months of experience" to "Intermediate" level.
 Is it better to specialize our learning and focus on mastering data science topics (e.g. pandas, numpy, stats)?
 Or is it just as good to go about it the same general way that other people in other areas learn (e.g. reading Automate the Boring Stuff or whatever that other book is called that people tend to recommend to beginners)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking for a Data Science practitioner perspective on the question of PC (in my case, a laptop) overheating during extended model training. 
 Scenario: You are using a GPU for model training for multiple days. The machine is always running, and it gets very hot.
 Should I be concerned?
 From what I can discern, there are built-in hardware limits to avoid dangerous overheating. But it's also possible for components to fail, and extended model training entails heavy uninterrupted usage which may bust manufacturer expectations. 
 For the sake of this discussion, assume that cloud compute is not an option. I'm interested in best practices for local machines.
 I would obviously like to avoid starting a fire in my home. Am I overthinking? / Does anyone take steps to mitigate risk?
 Thanks very much!

 It was always clear I want to pursue a career in a technical field, because I'm mostly interested in these topics. Especially Maths has always been my favorite subject in school (particularly analysis). The Physics and Computer Science classes are mediocre in my opinion. I never got into gaming or programming as a kid, although many of my friends really enjoyed it (and still do!).
 Since programming was always around me in my childhood (my dad works as a Software Engineer at a mid-size company), and still is through my classmates often working on their app all night long, I thought studying Computer Science (at TUM) would be the right career path for me.

 Channel 4’s alternative Christmas message will be generated and read by an AI, The message will be delivered by Ameca, one of the world’s most advanced robots.
 Ameca will speak about the highs and lows of 2022, after the King’s annual Christmas message at 3 pm. Know what's even crazier??? During the address, Ameca will also respond to questions about humans.
 She is due to say that humankind should be “neither happy nor sad” about the past year and “take it as a learning opportunity, a chance to change the way we think about the world and a reminder to help those in need whenever we can”.
 END OF BRITISH ACCENT, Hope that was fun
 I actually really hope Ameca has a British accent, that will just take whatever she has to say from a 7 to a freaking 11 over 10!

 Hi everyone,
 Would greatly appreciate to have career advice?
 I am majoring in Finance with a concentration in investment analysis and will be graduating in May 2023. I am 26 year old.
 I did an internship with Raymond James this summer in the Mutual Fund and ETF research team. And current doing an internship at a SearchFund company as an unpaid private equity intern. 
 I have been talking to my friends who are studying data engineering, which made me realize that I like technology and technical skills, and it also would suit me best since English is my second language. I have been in touch with my finance professor to see if I should do an M.S. in computer science to start my career over. He told me not to because he saw more people regret pursuing a master's and Ph.D. than getting a job and making a slow transition. 
 I am currently enrolled in a data science BootCamp and taking five classes. I am fresh to computer science. 
 I wonder what possible ways for me to land a data science job or something data related to make a smooth transition since I will graduate in May of 2023.
 What are possible titles that I should search for? 
 Thank you.

Went through an HR interview, all good.
 Then they sent me an assignment (it involved at least 2 days of work, manual labelling a dataset, training and testing a high-level NLP model).
 Then they called me for a 2-hour technical interview. I thought it went alright.
 They emailed me to improve on the solution I sent to the assignment and told me a figure for the salary. I improved and sent my solution.
 They emailed me that they couldn’t give me an offer.
  
Should I have stopped when they asked me to improve the solution? If not, then how should I feel after I did spend time improving it while they also sent me a figure and then not getting an offer? I’m curious what you think of all of this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! My name is Daniel, and I'm looking for someone to mentor me in data science. If you or someone you know would like to help me out, I would be really keen to learn.
 A bit about my current skillset: I've done some online udemy courses in Python, DS, ML, and DL, and have practised a bit on Kaggle. I also have a Bsc Honours degree in Applied Mathematics Cum Laude (but I haven't done much math since I graduated end of 2018).
 Please comment or dm me if you're interested.
 Thanks!

My GPA is 3.13, but I’ve had internships where I used Excel and I spend a lot of time optimizing my resume. I also networking to get a referral for a Financial analyst role at a major financial company and my I’ve had phone interviews and a few interviews w/ major companies, and even one w/ a Fortune 4 company. I’ve already completed the Google data analytics certificate. I need a way to stand out for analytics roles, and I may need to complete an online bootcamp that only requires payment if I find a job. At this point, I’m running out of options. What should I do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a data analyst for financial data, specifically music royalties. We track various sources, types of income, regions, etc over time, looking for peaks or gaps and then trying to figure out why they happened. We don’t worry about many “typical” data science things like correlation or prediction, and in general there’s no link between what we uncover and decision making. Ie if we discover that artist A isn’t big in Japan they’re not going to write their next song with that in mind. 
 It’s an interesting job in many ways but data-wise, I think it’s safe to call it boring. 
 I’d love to know what would be the opposite of that: a job where both the approaches and the conclusions are insightful, and where they impact of the data can change future data - Ie. by impacting future decisions. 
 Does anyone have any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently learned that "unconferences" aka "non-conferences" are a thing. Experts from an industry domain get together without a well-defined program. It can be people with similar technical backgrounds just booking the same hotel for a week in order to have a great time, go on leisure activities, information exchange, and networking.
 The first time I heard about this was when I stumbled over Codefreeze. This unconference, however, is for normal programmers rather than for data scientists or data engineers. I am wondering in how far I can talk about my passion (machine learning, text mining, et cetera) there.
 Has anyone heard of a comparable concept for the data domain?

 A friend and I are trying to make an animation for a song but have been struggling to find an animator to work with us. What we have is the completed storyboard (2D, drawn on iPad), drawn such that each frame of the storyboard could work as a keyframe.
 Is there an AI-based tool which would interpolate the frames in between using any 2 keyframes? It's alright if it's paid too but would prefer a free one.
 Thanks in advance :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically the title, I am finishing my studies and I found two companies that would hire me for an 6-month internship, which are trial periods because they hire you at the end if all goes well.
 It's not completely career-defining, but still pretty important so I'd like some insights from someone who knows what I should look for.
 Both are the same type of data service companies, they put you on a project for a few months and you solve it and go to the next client and repeat. 
 Firm A is twice as big (2k5 vs 1k2 people) and is related to a big tech company where I live.
 I had a better contact with firm B during interviews and they seem to pay a little better during career.
 On firm A, I'd go directly on a client project and on firm B I'd do a research project and then a client project.
 The salary is the same for both internship but firm A has a little bit more advantages.
 So if anybody has an advice, i'm listening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I recently finished my Master's in computational neuroscience after a Bachelor's in computer science and I am now trying to find a data science job. The goal of this post is trying to figure out what I should put an extra effort to learn and understand better before going to interviews, as well as what questions should I ask myself before (technical, conceptual or others). I would also be grateful for any other general tips. While this is a general question that may have been raised here in the past, I am adding some of my background below to maybe get more focused answers.
 I have worked with random forests, SVM, gradient boosting, SHAP, simple feed forward networks, convolutions and (simple) recurrent networks. I think I understand the concepts behind these, as well as some mathematical intuition (not to say I could implement it from scartch).
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an AI researcher, after talking with researchers from other domains, I am just wondering why we need to implement other tons of baselines to compare with our own approach in most cases. Painfully, some of the baselines are not open-sourced or well-organized, or nondetailed. To quantify this, I set a rough timer during one research work. I found more than 60% of the time was put into the implementation of other works. I have no idea whether it is my personal case or not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, teachers have struggled to help every student with their individualized educational needs. This gets, even more, tougher in a class of twenty, thirty, or forty students in which every student has to pass through the same tests, irrespective of the student's personalized needs.
 That said, the schoolrooms of today have not changed much in the past 50 years. Students sit in a room together and complete the same lessons—typically using the same textbooks—no matter their learning skills or expertise in a particular subject. Some students get left behind. Others are left unchallenged and bored by this one-size-for-all approach.
 AI could do all this now. AI today is helping teachers in creating a series of smart content programs and intelligent tutoring systems that help students learn in a more customized approach. Students will be able to learn new things in a much better way with advanced tutor apps.
 Such apps can become education mentors for students and provide engaging learning opportunities.AI can now track the performance of an individual student based on his previous grades, participation, and performances and help a student realize his maximum potential.
 The rest of this article covers some ways in which AI is making education smarter, cheaper, and more accessible to all:
  
AI as a tutor
 AI can automate grading
 AI can provide cognitive insights in classrooms
 AI can improve the education system

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently graduated out of college with a bachelor in business administration. Decided that I wanted to make a career change into CS and data science looks really appealing. I’ve always considered myself heavily analytical from my baseball background, and enjoy working with numbers. It seems like a great fit for me.
 My issue is that I have no idea where to start when it comes to learning data science and gaining the skills to land employment. I’ve seen 3 paths most people take (formal-masters, informal-courses; and self teaching) 
 As a 23 year old with a lot of time on my hands. What are the technical skills a data scientist needs to know in order to be successful? Also what’s a realistic time frame for me to start applying for DS jobs; 3-5 Years?
 Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi friends.
Beluga is my reaction to all the Twitter craziness. I’ve been thinking about this idea for a long time and finally decided to build the app a few months back.
The idea is straightforward. Can we build a Twitter-like experience without central servers or a single point of failure? RSS was my point of reference, and that’s why Beluga is essentially a feed reader/writer.
When you publish a post, Beluga will create a beluga.json file and upload it to your S3-compatible server. Other users can follow you and get updates by fetching that file. The beluga.json file is JSON Feed compatible to maximize interoperability. The app also publishes a beluga.xml which is a standard RSS feed. Users can follow your Beluga feed from the app or from their favorite RSS reader.
To make the app even more accessible, a static mini-site is generated and published to your S3-compatible online storage.
Here’s the mini-site of my feed: https://beluga.gcollazo.com
Please give the app a try.
Upcoming features:
Easy publish without setting your own S3 bucket
Read-only mode
Multiple device sync
Support for more S3 compatible providers
Support for GitHub pages
Mastodon interoperability
