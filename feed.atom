        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, as someone trying to get into data science being a business student, I've been searching for the skills needed to become a data scientist and most youtubers say you need math like calculus and linear algebra without getting into much detail, so I don't know what are the most important stuff to focus on. I found these 2 books one for calculus and the other for linear algebra and I'd like to hear from you if these are enough, too much or too little.
 (Last picture is for the calculus book and the rest are for the Linear algebra book)
 I'd really appreciate your help and thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How much money % would you go for with the massive devaluation in the currency and the expected inflation ahead?
 I'm thinking that changing for 10% more salary might not be worth, as probably very quickly in the next months salaries will need to adjust considerably.
 Probably a 25% increase would make it worth? or not even so? I feel like 25% would put me just like the same buying power I had 2 years ago. Nominally making more money, but the buying power will remain the same.
 What's the % for changing?

I was webscraping a government website’s page and didn’t think about whether it was actually okay or not.. After this I read the privacy policy and any terms and there is no mention of webscraping specifically.
 The data is completely public, anyone can go to the page and look at it. It just says you can’t use the data for commercial use, which I don’t think I am doing (?)
 Is this okay? Or are they going to track me down or get me in trouble? 🥹
 I’m a very new data analyst and was just trying to help my coworkers reduce the manual work because normally they just copy and paste the information into an excel file anyway

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The past three weeks I've been massaging the data a lot to get the best set of clusters to represent the customers we have.
 To start, RFM represents:
  
R = Number of days since last purchase for a given customer relative to today
 F = Total orders made by customer - 1 (we exclude the first order, we only care about repeat purchases)
 M = Average dollar spent across all orders per customer
  
I started with the three as my features, but later expanded and added additional elements such as age of customer, standard deviation between transactions, and average time between transactions.
 My challenge is the frequency data, where the data is extremely right skewed (exponential graph, where 70% of customers representing 2 purchases made, 15% representing 3 purchases made, etc.)
 I think I resolved the skewness with creating a feature that's Log(Monetary x Frequency) - As customers buy more items, the value increases, therefore "pushing away" infrequent customers.
 Management want 3 customer segments categorized as "High, Mid, Low". However, elbow method and Yellow bricks recommended 5 clusters, 
 I've tried three clustering methods:
  
KMeans with all features combined
 Gaussian Mixture Model - I selected this method given the high density of frequency cohorts
 Naive KMeans - take the RFM columns only, and run KMeans for each feature alone. Then find the average of each cluster, and score manually to bucket the clusters into High, Mid, Low (for example, a cluster with low R, high F, and high M gets to be the High Value customer cluster)
  
I want to ask to ask if there's anyone with Customer Analytics that I can consult with on whether there's a benefit to each approach, or if you have recommendations on a different approach

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 Currently, a sophomore and have two offers I'm trying to decide between. One is not technical at all, management consulting at a Big4 firm vs a quantitative analyst role at a financial company (they make tools for investors). 
 I interned with Deloitte freshmen year and really enjoyed consulting work. I'm majoring in data science with a math minor; however, business and general strategy really appeals to me along with interacting with lots of people. I'm not the most technically savvy person in regards with coding, but do enjoy general problem-solving. Not quite sure which to choose... Deloitte is paying approximately $15/hr more though, and I'm a broke college student. 
 Which would be the best for my career progression? Any input is greatly appreciated!

I spent 40 hours on dataquest, but i dont have enough money to buy it for 40€ every month.
 I really want to learn as much informations as i can, is to good investement or are there better courses for cheaper/free? I am doing lot of other courses like google data analytics, statistics from edx and more. Can someone maybe share an account with me so i can learn faster? I can share you other courses from my library.
 If anyone has any materials in PDF, please write me a PM. I will be very happy.

I've studied some java and even javascript before deciding to dive deep into data science, so I'm familiarized with IDEs in general. I was just wondering which one is the most used in the market, or even which on would be the best for someone who's just starded learning.

We’re doing our best to hide the customization prompts on the back end so users are able to quickly search for pre-existing generated photos, or create new ones that would ideally work as well.
If we keep going with it, in future versions we’d like to add voting, better tags, and more varied prompts, or maybe whatever you recommend!

The company I was working for was incredibly supportive and I managed to transition to a data analyst role.
 I eventually swapped over to a very large bank where I have been at for almost 5 years now. The bank was also incredibly supportive and sponsored my move from Europe to the US, and I am now living in NYC.
 The role I do is a weird mix of a lot of things: I still do a lot of analysis and work with predictive modelling, but I just as easily also do web app development, task automations, I've built emails and solutions in Python to maintain those emails, worked with UNIX servers, worked on ETL pipelines, a really weird m…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-09-30T14:44:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN!
I became frustrated with the unpredictible/poor match quality and opaqueness of "relevance scores" in existing fuzzy and fulltext search libs, so I tried something different and this is the result. The main selling point is the result quality / ordering, with best-in-class memory overhead and excellent performance being bonuses. The API is pretty stable at this point, but looking for feedback before committing to 1.0.
TL;DR
The test corpus is a 4MB json file with 162k words/phrases, so give it a second for initial download. You can also drag/drop your own text/json corpus into the UI to try it against your own dataset.
Live demo/compare with a few other libs (there are many more in the codebase, in various states of completion, WIP):
https://leeoniya.github.io/uFuzzy/demos/compare.html?libs=uF...
In isolation for perf assessment:
https://leeoniya.github.io/uFuzzy/demos/compare.html?libs=uF...
To increase fuzziness and get broader results, try setting intraMax=1 (core) and enable outOfOrder (userland):
https://leeoniya.github.io/uFuzzy/demos/compare.html?libs=uF...
Also play with the sortPreset selector to swap out the default Array.sort() for one in userland that prioritizes typehead-ness (the resultset remains identical).
Still TODO:
  - Example of stripping diacritics
  - Example of using non-latin charsets
  - Example of prefix-caching to improve typeahead perf even further
  - Example of poor man's document search (matching multiple object properties)

 I have been on this subreddit for a while and one thing I have learnt is that nothings matters more than your ability to do projects if you want to get into DS.
 Background: I am currently a third year Math & Stats undergraduate. I finished a CS diploma in the past. With going to school at the moment full time and also working full time. I barely have any time left. School consumes so much time because of pure math courses I am taking. Having said that how do I manage to do at least some projects on side before I graduate?

People saying that it's stealing, "not real art," "not real artists," lazy, dystopian, evil, and just downright immoral. These takes are so baffling to me, because all I see is artists bashing a new artistic medium. Just like what people used to do with digital art.
 As an artist (not to humble brag) but I worked goddamn hard to do what I do! I practiced really fucking hard and didn't give up. At the same time, I am immensely privileged to have had the time to practice, study, and money spent on classes growing up, and on quality supplies.
 But not everyone has that.
 Those people are deserving of having a creative outlet like everyone else. Not just any creative outlet, but one that makes it easy, free, and tha…]]></summary>

Should I get 32gb RAM if I’m going to do machine leaning and big data?

 I’ve been learning a bit of scala the past few weeks and am really enjoying it but from what I gather, the language doesn’t seem to have much of a foothold in the data science/data engineering space, even among Spark users.
 Just wondering if there’s any practical benefit to continuing down this path or if it’s a complete waste of time. I’m getting kind of bored with python and really just want something new to explore.

I don't fully understand what a data lake is - or a warehouse for that matter as I haven't worked with one yet. But my question is are they actually useful and if so - why are people complaining?
 Are people complaining about data lakes because theirs is badly implemented and/or badly understood and/or badly integrated in the day-to-day work? Or are they complaining because as a concept ("just chuck everything in the same place and forget about it. Maybe someone will find a use later ") data lakes are a suboptimal workaround that doesn't address a companies actual data problems?

 I am a Data Analyst and trying to gain a basic understanding of Apache Spark and have been stuck on some technical definitions of this framework, particularly its most advanced technique: distributed computing. 
 As PySpark is introduced as a better solution for large datasets over Pandas (as it runs on 1 computer), if I execute a script, where is it running on actually? I only have one PC, what distributed computers in this case means? 
 I need some English explanations for this topic as all I google out were technical terms.
