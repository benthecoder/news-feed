        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a newcomer to this community, I wanted to share my recent findings on the topic of machine learning. Through my research, I discovered that hardware capability is not the primary bottleneck in most machine learning applications. Instead, the quality and quantity of the training data, as well as the choice of model architecture and training algorithms, play a much more significant role in determining the success of a machine learning project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not joking. I think the future is going to be having AI replace the current "voice" in my head as it is better informed than my brain is and I can already see the ways it would be useful for me to have access to it every waking minute.
 My questions I would like to hear people's thoughts on:
  
The ethical and security risks are obvious, but how do we address them, is more relevant
 Who is working on this already, surely audio specialists have ways of "plugging" us in (I am ex IT and currently a stock trader so interested from an investment angle too)
 What do you see as the least intrusive way to have something like ChatGPT available to you every minute of the day wherever you are, and able to inform you in the same way your inner dialogue currently does.
  
I think this AI boom happening with chatGPT will be bigger than crapto when it finally gets into our lives. People I talk to are afraid of it, but in using ChatGPT I have realised the fear is unfounded. Sure, data security and privacy of information is paramount, and there will certainly be many lost jobs and problems associated to it, but I am already seeing the incredible benefits of this service will far outweigh all of them in the future for humanity.
 The current limitations are because people havent become aware of just how useful this thing is going to be to us. My biggest concern is the speed we will come to rely on it will make living without it impossible within one generation. 
 Is there anywhere better than reddit I could be asking this question? Where are the AI eggheads to be found?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm performing seasonal analysis on time series data. However there's an inflationary component which I'm not worried about. Is there a method generally used for flattening out my increasing sin wave? 
 I imagine this would feature in predictive modelling for pricing but it's not an area where I'm familiar. 
 Incase my title isn't clear I'll included a link to a graphing calculator showing what I mean.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just completed a BSc in DS, and I'd be keen to proceed to Masters, however I don't want to go over the same basics that we did in the undergrad (basic stats, linear algebra, basic supervised/unsupervised learning techniques) and it seems like every DS masters in the UK is in fact a "conversion" course for other STEM grads.
 Is there a Masters that actually looks into the state of the art techniques / focuses on advanced DS applications / significantly dives into areas such as NLP or Machine Vision etc? I don't want to just repeat stuff that I already know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I moved to a new job that uses Snowflake. This may be a dumb question since Im still new to Snowflake.
 I used BigQuery at my old job and loved how easy it was to connect BQ to Google Sheets and run queries and jobs through sheets. With Snowflake, I'm constantly extracting and importing CSVs every time I make a change to my queries. My stakeholders frequently have description statistics needs so this is something I want to automate and get out of the way.
 It'd be great to recreate that BigQuery data connector experience with Snowflake but I'm not sure how to without paying for a third party extension
 For Snowflake folks that have dealt with this, have you figured something out? Only other idea I had was a Python script that queries from Snowflake and loads the table into gSheet. If anyone has done this, any potential issues with this? I've done this with BigQuery without a problem but not sure what I'll run into with Snowflake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys I have very minimal (1.5 years) of experience in DS. That was from a Fintech company. 
 Now after pursuing my masters I'm applying for jobs again. 
 But I'm finding that most, if not all of the interview requests are coming from fintech companies. 
 The reason why I pursued masters was to change the industry I worked in. 
 I want to get into medicine industry. Kind of like biostatistics to be precise. I want to work on huge govt health datasets and help guide the decision making. 
 I have done MOOCs and courses online about biostats and to show that I have knowledge of biology/medicine. 
 And yet, it feels very hard to change the industry. 
 Do you guys have any suggestions? So that atleast I get responses from health sector... I am at a point where I'm willing to get paid less than what I was getting in my previous role. But I know that this is the sector where I want to utilize my skills in.
 Thanks in advance.

ErLog is just a simple go web server which batch inserts json logs into an sqlite3 server. Through tuning sqlite3 and batching inserts, I find I can get around 8k log insertions/sec which is fast enough for small projects.
This is just an MVP, and I plan to add more features once I talk to users. If anyone has any problems with logging, feel free to leave a comment and I'd love to help you out.

I don't really think that is the right approach here. Typically we'd go into something like this by starting with a model that we design intuitively, then compare with the game results, and spend time trying to identify what causes differences between the game and model How can there be a descriptive understanding without a model
  
I have an MS in Data analytics (not from a great school but still) and every one of my courses started with "Do EDA to ensure you can model your data first"
 AM I missing some nuance here about when to do EDA or when to immediately go "linear regression"

 I do a lot of drawing using Microsoft Paint because I really love the aesthetic. I draw a lot of cartoony characters and scenes, (think Big Lez Show). And I was wondering whether there are any AI softwares out there that can generate images in an art style that looks similar to cartoonish MS Paint drawings? If not, could I upload my past drawings to any software and feed it images so it can learn my aesthetic and generate new drawings from them? I'm looking specifically for a cartoonish MS Paint art style. Thank you in advance and sorry again if this is a noob question

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a brief intro, I’ve been stalking this sub for a while and in the couple years that I’ve started studying data science, your collective advice has enabled me to learn a lot of cool data science techniques, land data science internships, and improve my understanding of key math areas like linear algebra, probability, and stats. I use this sub as a direct resource for learning data science so your advice is very much appreciated on my end.
 Currently I’m an undergraduate studying Data Science at a top 10 school globally. Although I’ve felt that my major’s curriculum has helped me establish a solid understanding of the math, programming, and analytical aspects of data science, my major has generally been focused on predictive modeling rather than inferential modeling. 
 At this point in time, I have taken four different ML/DL courses where I’ve gained a pretty strong grounding in classical ML techniques, core DL frameworks, and implementation/productization. However, although I’ve learned through classes and self-studying regression analysis and hypothesis testing, I have yet to take a class solely dedicated to inferential modeling as a whole.
 This coming quarter, should I take my 5th ML/DL course to further establish my knowledge and approach to predictive modeling, or should I take a course solely dedicated to Applied Regression Analysis (name of the course) to gain a better grounding in inferential modeling?
 TLDR; Should I take 5th ML/DL course or 1st regression analysis/inferential modeling course?

Since free time is pretty scarce between work priorities and family life, I’m very particular about topics I should study and qualify of material. Does anyone have any recommendations for a tool I could use to
  
Keep track of topics I want to cover whether I’ve completed it, currently working on it or want to get to it in the future
 
Store links to material covering that topic that I’ve decided is worth it
 
Make note of where I am in the material, just a note to self where I left off if I need to break for a few week. (YouTube series, books, moocs etc…)
 
Store my notes regarding each topic for later reference. Could be a link or file attachment etc…
 
 I was initially thinking trello, but I’m curious if anyone else is overthinks their learning as much as I do and what you’re using.

 I've added over 120 new tools to the catalog this week, but there are still more than 1000 projects waiting to be added.
 To help prioritize which tools to add next, I thought it would be a good idea to create a priority list.
 If you have created an incredible AI project or know of one that you think should be included, please let me know in the comments. I'll make sure to move it to the top of my list of tools to add:)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: a 31 y.o. DS\researcher working mostly with time-series wearables data, lagging behind modern development stack. Willing to become a more demanded and better paid pro, possibly in an adjacent field. How should I spend 6 months (fulltime) with the maximum benefit?
 I will be laid off in March-April because of the reorg and will have 6 month of from-work-to-work time (employer's termination notice). I won't be expected to do much, but I want to use that time with the maximum profit for myself. I can find another similar job, but see this as an opportunity to reinvent myself. What should I do?
 - change profession to data engineering (I kinda miss research aspect there, but there are so many vacancies...)
 - refocus to a different sexy domain (trading algos, video AI, blockchain,...?)
 I think the best way to go is to learn stuff by doing and develop my portfolio at the same time (public github, kaggle competitions). 
 Does anyone has ideas on the roadmap? Thanks.

My goal is to stay in my current position for at least another year and move onto a more technical data role such as a BI Developer. I've been looking into Masters programs but it's been difficult to commit to going back to school (time/ money). My ultimate goal is to become a data scientist, and I know a Masters degree will one day be required for me to move into this role. How long did you guys wait until you went back to school? Is a masters worth it? Or could I do a graduate certificate instead?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am interviewing with a systematic hedge fund for a quant research role (I am a statistics masters student currently) . I have an all-day onsite interview coming up in which I am told I will be given a dataset at 9am, and will have to "present my findings" at about 4pm. The data is not necessarily financial; it could be something like weather or sports.
 The explicit requirements for the role are familiarity with Python, Pandas etc., and good background in stats -- not necessarily Kaggle whizz. It's hard to imagine making much progress on quite an undirected task in that little time, particularly when random bugs and errors are basically bound to happen and cost time at some point, and when some time at the end needs to be spent preparing a presentation.
 I would be very grateful for some advice from anyone who knows about junior data science roles (particularly in finance):
 - What sort of level of analysis would be expected in this timeframe?
 - Given that a large chunk of time will need to be spent on doing very basic explorations and plots, and on preparing a presentation, how is it possible to impress in an interview like this?
 Many thanks for any help, this interview seems like quite a daunting task!

 I had a question and am not sure if I'm supposed to ask it here. If not can you please tell me where I should take my question? 
 I was wondering how to make an AI-generated video in a similar fashion to this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO3q6MA668 or the AI batman story, where you input a large amount of text and it spitting back out a new script in a similar style to the original.
 I was hoping to use this method for my youtube channel of 681 videos, taking all of the transcripts from each video, feeding that into the program, and seeing what funny nonsense it spits back out and making a video on it. 
 ​
 What program or tool should I use and what would you recommend for the steps to achieve the best results? Is this really too far out of my league? Thank you :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GPT is getting competition from open-source.
 A group of researchers, around the YouTuber Yannic Kilcher, have announced that they are working on Open Assistant. The goal is to produce a chat-based language model that is much smaller than GPT-3 while maintaining similar performance.
 If you want to support them, they are crowd-sourcing training data here.
 What Does This Mean?
 Current language models are too big.
 They require millions of dollars of hardware to train and use. Hence, access to this technology is limited to big organizations. Smaller firms and universities are effectively shut out from the developments.
 Shrinking and open-sourcing models will facilitate academic research and niche applications.
 Projects such as Open Assistant will help to make language models a commodity. Lowering the barrier to entry will increase access and accelerate innovation.
 What an exciting time to be alive! 
 Thank you for reading! I really enjoyed making this for you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So long story short, my undergrad was in international affairs, nothing technical. I touched R a little bit but nothing extensive. I decided during the pandemic I was going to push to get a STEM masters to supplement my undergrad and I knocked it out. I really enjoyed it and I can use a ton of tools to develop ML solutions and deploy models leveraging tools like Sagemaker. I’ve even become an OK programmer. The issue I have is many of these solutions and tools are black box. I can apply the tool to solve a problem but I don’t always know how it works and, being honest, there’s a lot of effing tools. 
 I feel like I’ve got a good warm and fuzzy about what data science and ML can do and what it can’t but I find a lot of jobs will post their need for people with extensive education in quantitative skills, or vast experience with A/B testing which I understand but haven’t done extensively, or 6 years building solutions with Tensorflow. Thus, I feel like I might be wildly under skilled despite the degree. 
 Maybe the industry is just so flooded now that DS roles really require a deep specialized knowledge because it’s so competitive. Seems like there are lots of PhD roles in industry these days. 
 Would it make sense for me to go back and hammer out the math? Another undergrad? Another masters maybe? Push forward and do a PhD and lose steady income for the 4 years maybe more?
 Maybe this is classic imposter syndrome. I digress. But anyway, advice is always good to have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Couple of months ago I took part in a hackathon related to scouting football players for Sevilla FC. The data had more than 80,000 columns, and no proper information on the data being presented.
 The data that was provided had column names as "X_0,X_1,...". We are given scouting data which has age team played for performance but along with this 80000 columns with absolutely no context. So I can't infer anything, nor do I have skills to tackle such data.
 As I am a student with work experience only as a software tester I generally practice data science using open source data or kaggle. On these platforms we have some insights on each attributes of the data.
 How will you guys go about processing the data before creating a Ml model for such cases where dimensions are high so manually doing eda is very hard?
