        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company has a $1k education stipend and I am not sure how best to spend it. I was given advice to not take a technical class but rather executive coaching/communication/non-technical class. I thought about toastmasters to work on presentations but I have been told it may not align well with technical presentations. Does anyone have any recommendations?

I tried graphing the difference between the two datasets, but this didn't work because there would be a high difference when both datasets are peaking if one dataset had a higher peak than the other. I only want to see times where one dataset has a peak and the other dataset does not have a peak at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, at uni they told us that if the measured quantities are uncorrelatedwe need to use the quadratic formula to sum errors (sqrt(E1^2+...)). however they didn't exactly told us what correlated quantities are. For example, measuring current and voltage through a resistance in a circuit, are those 2 quantities correlated meassure? On internet I couldn't find a definitive answer as everything is so vague. I read that you need to calculate the covariance, but I didn't find what values determines if they are uncorrelated or not, for examples, a covariance of 0.07 means that the 2 values are correlated or uncorrelated from one another? I know this is very chaotic but it's 1 am and am very sleepy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graduated a few years ago and in that time have been dealing with personal and the standard covid issues. In that time I have been applying for entry level roles like "data analyst" and such, but have never been able to get past the first camera interview. 
 I studied SQL and Tableau in college and have been refreshing myself over it again and I really do like writing and building database releated things. I'm just frustrated at myself as I've been stuck in a retail role while others able to easiler get into roles and move around jobs it seems. 
 On top of this, the feedback advice I've been getting from places I interviewed for has been "you don't have experience go figure out what you want to do". This is pushing me to my limit as I just want a data focused entry level job to grow into and even will take a pay for around 40k/year just to get in a foot in the door.
 Is there any advice people might have here as to what I might be missing or have been in a similar situation?
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, 
 I believe that some data scientists/ML engineers with experience in this field could help me and other future graduates in this situation. 
 I will be graduating from a Data Science BS in May and am currently searching for a job.
 ​
  
I currently see most entry-level offers requiring a year of experience. Should I still apply for these positions, or is there actually no chance of getting them?
 For interview preparation, LeetCode is pretty useful for Python and SQL. Do you have any advice on how to get ready for ML or statistics questions?
  
​
 Feel free to DM me or comment any advise you have. 
 Thanks for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper argues and shows that speculative vectorization, where a loop with rare or unknown memory dependencies are still vectorized, is fundamentally vulnerable and cannot be mitigated by existing defenses. We implement a simple proof of concept and show the leakage in Apple M2 SoC. We describe the source of leakage using Microarchitectural Leakage Descriptors MLD and we additionally describe principles to extend MLD for other optimization. Also as part of implementation we reverse engineer the M2 cache size and use threaded timer to differentiate between cache hit and miss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Transient Execution Attacks (TEAs) have gradually become a major security threat to modern high-performance processors. They exploit the vulnerability of speculative execution to illegally access private data, and transmit them through timing-based covert channels. While new vulnerabilities are discovered continuously, the covert channels can be categorised to two types: 1) Persistent Type, in which covert channels are based on the layout changes of buffering, e.g. through caches or TLBs; 2) Volatile Type, in which covert channels are based on the contention of sharing resources, e.g. through execution units or issuing ports. The defenses against the persistent-type covert channels have been well addressed, while those for the volatile-type are still rather inadequate. Existing mitigation schemes for the volatile type such as Speculative Compression and Time-Division-Multiplexing will introduce significant overhead due to the need to stall the pipeline or to disallow resource sharing. In this paper, we look into such attacks and defenses with a new perspective, and propose a scheduling-based mitigation scheme, called SPECWANDS. It consists of three priority-based scheduling policies to prevent an attacker from transmitting the secret in different contention situations. SPECWANDS not only can defend against both inter-thread and intra-thread based attacks, but also can keep most of the performance benefit from speculative execution and resource-sharing. We evaluate its runtime overhead on SPEC 2006/2017 benchmarks. The experimental results show that SPECWANDS has a significant performance advantage (3%-5%) over the other two representative schemes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Single Sign-On (SSO) shifts the crucial authentication process on a website to to the underlying SSO protocols and their correct implementation. To strengthen SSO security, organizations, such as IETF and W3C, maintain advisories to address known threats. One could assume that these security best practices are widely deployed on websites. We show that this assumption is a fallacy. We present SSO-MONITOR, an open-source fully-automatic large-scale SSO landscape, security, and privacy analysis tool. In contrast to all previous work, SSO-MONITOR uses a highly extensible, fully automated workflow with novel visual-based SSO detection techniques, enhanced security and privacy analyses, and continuously updated monitoring results. It receives a list of domains as input to discover the login pages, recognize the supported Identity Providers (IdPs), and execute the SSO. It further reveals the current security level of SSO in the wild compared to the security best practices on paper. With SSO-MONITOR, we automatically identified 1,632 websites with 3,020 Apple, Facebook, or Google logins within the Tranco 10k. Our continuous monitoring also revealed how quickly these numbers change over time. SSO-MONITOR can automatically login to each SSO website. It records the logins by tracing HTTP and in-browser communication to detect widespread security and privacy issues automatically. We introduce a novel deep-level inspection of HTTP parameters that we call SMARTPARMS. Using SMARTPARMS for security analyses, we uncovered URL parameters in 5 Client Application (Client) secret leakages and 337 cases with weak CSRF protection. We additionally identified 447 cases with no CSRF protection, 342 insecure SSO flows and 9 cases with nested URL parameters, leading to an open redirect in one case. SSO-MONITOR reveals privacy leakages that deanonymize users in 200 cases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I've talked about glidesort a few times on HN already, but it's finally ready for release. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. An academic paper on glidesort that goes into a lot more detail than the readme is upcoming, but is not ready yet.
I will be giving a talk on glidesort tomorrow at FOSDEM 2023 in the Rust Devroom at 16:10, you can seek me out there as well. In other news, I am leaving academia soon, so if you have interesting (Rust) jobs the coming months feel free to approach me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think it's amazing how generative AI has taken the world by storm and continues to be a source of deep fascination in the public domain. Not so long ago, when I realized how AI would be important, I start digging for news about it and become so interested in this subject. 
 You may read here the latest news on AI, but anyway, I need to share some stuff with you. 
 I was amazed to find out that the AI model called AlphaCode brings humanity one step closer to that vision, according to a recent study. Researchers say the DeepMind system could soon assist experienced coders, but it’s unlikely to replace them fully. 
 Can't wait to see what will all be possible thanks to AI. 
 What do you find as most interesting development by AI? 
 Following training, AlphaCode solved 34% of problems, per DeepMind reports. In another demonstration, DeepMind entered AlphaCode into an online coding competition. Competing with 5,000 participants, the system outperformed 45.7% of programmers. Researchers also found that AlphaCode did not strictly duplicate large portions of code or logic. According to Ellis, this is a surprising turn of events. 
 However, there is an opposite side of the coin. As you are probably aware, some experts believe continuing to iterate could result in a super-intelligent AI that could harm the entire planet. Does this, despite being a wonderful development, occasionally worry you because there is a chance that AI could replace humans since they will be able to perform all tasks as people?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a predictive model that is built using a Minitab decision tree. The model has a 70% accuracy compared to a most frequent dummy classifier that would have an 80% accuracy. I suggested that we use Python and a more modern ML method to approach this problem. She, and I quote, said, “that’s a terrible idea.”
 To be honest the whole process is terrible, there was no evidence of EDA, feature engineering, or anything I would consider to be a normal part of the ML process. The model is “put into production” by recreating the tree’s logic in SQL, resulting in a SQL query 600 lines long.
 It is my task to review this model and present my findings to management. How do I work with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I assume this is a silly question but I am someone who has just barely begun learning programming (Java) in university and my previous experience with mathematics is not very good. I suck at it. I barely remember any algebra from high school and even back then I did not understand it quite fully. 
 However, recently I've been very interested in learning about developing an AI. I realize this is a broad subject but what gave me this interest is seeing all this AI art and AI voice programs. I don't really "approve" of it if you want to call it that, but I'm very interested in how it works. I also saw this virtual YouTuber that is an AI, so I wanted to learn how the program reads the live chat and can say some real uncanny responses or just silly ones. I'm just interested in how that works and maybe learn how to develop something like those things. For fun and personal use, not really thinking I'd get to the point of publishing anything. 
 Getting a bit ahead of myself now, so I'm just wondering if anyone have any advice for someone like me on how to get started from, basically, scratch? Thank you to anyone responding, I'd really appreciate any help! :D

 I've always wanted to try my hand at making a chatbot, but as a beginner in data science, I could use some help.

 Any recommendations on industry/conference literatures or books, that go deep into Market Basket analysis?
