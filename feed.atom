        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all data scientists, What is the best cpu (amd or intel) for heavy data analysis/science projects? I need to decide which is better to do advanced data stuff. The go to is desktop. Is latest cpu really important or not? I need advice related to senior level advanced data project but not for noob/dummy level. There is no limit for my budget. So how can I choose and consider about cpu specs? Also I wanna know more about maximum & minimum requirement for cpu types especially designed for data analysis. Apart from other pc specs, how can you decide which cpu is most suitable for DS professionals? Please, I seriously need your specific & detailed answers! Sorry for my bad english. Thanks for help.

 My contract during covid was $75/hr no benefits and was short term renewed at $80. This new position wants to offer me $60/hr no benefits and I would go onto a 1099, which would cost me an extra 8% in taxes. I held that previous contract for two years and I felt that it established my going rate.
 Industry. Not a FAANG.
 I'm not going to overshare, but I am in my late 30s and know all the things and have done all the things.
 I'm seriously considering declining the offer and continuing my search, but I wanted to see if the internet hivemind thinks I'm being ridiculous and that $120k for industry is standard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it just me or has the job hunt gotten more competitive in the last year? I was on a temporary team last year and was hunting for DS and some DA positions throughout. I was relatively picky, but was consistently receiving offers (and able to negotiate).
 The one I landed on ended up laying me off after a few months and since then the search has been a lot harder. So far out of 19 places I've screened with (or been sent an assessment from) I've had 8 ghosts and 7 rejections. The feedback has been inconsistent, but more so than last year I am hearing back that they just went with another candidate or that others were farther along in the process. This is particularly distressing for me since I am way less picky than I was and having a hard time with positions I feel I am over-qualified for.
 Are others experiencing the same thing? Is this just a combination of more people looking after lay-offs and fewer open positions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there
 What do you guys think about using a ML model to find statistical differences between populations? Let me explain my particular case:
 I have a dataset of 56 cells (more to come) coming from 4 different patients (target variable) with different illness conditions, each cell has ~22 numerical features and our aim is to find differences among the patients (one being the control). Since looking for correlations between features and statistical differences become too overwhelming and tedious, I thought of training a interpretable ML model and use it to discover which properties have the cell of each patient, There is no intention/value to make future predictions. The 2 best performing models were Logistic Regresion and a Random Forest with AOC > 0.9 and F1-score > 0.9 (trained with the whole dataset an 10-fold CV). Afterwards I use the SHAP-values and permutation feature importance to see which features and values intervals are more characteristic for each patient. Although there is a bit of discrepancy between the order of the most important features given by LogReg and RForest, there is good agreement for the most important features at each case. I found this method superior to PCA since some features add little to the global variance but are important for a particular patient.
 This is exploratory research, so the main question to answer with this approach is: is the good performing model a good way of finding whether cells coming from different illnesses are different?
 What do you think about this practice? have you used it in your work?
 Cheers¡

 Any suggestions appreciated!
 Edit: to the people saying ‘just don’t’, I need to learn this for a university course I’m taking so don’t exactly have a choice, and also it does seem like a useful skill to have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever AI is discussed the main topics are unemployment, ethics, out of control AI.
 These are real concerns but let us assume for a moment that these problems are solvable. The big elephant in the room is the concern of human usefulness. 
 What does it mean when the human race is longer useful?
 How do we deal with long term profession planning, for you or your kids? 
 You invest a decade becoming an illustrator. Now AI can do it better. Your investment is now worth nothing. You may take this lightly because it has not affected you yet but this is a question beyond a certain profession.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: I am looking for datasets of which the attributes can be intuitively visualized (e.g. as a matrix. an image, a diagram, etc.) and are easy to individually select (e.g. by dragging over the matrix/image). What's more, it should be a dataset with which t-SNE has some difficulty, and of which some conceptual clusters are erroneously merged or separated in the embedding.
 I am developing an adaptation of t-SNE — specifically Linear complexity t-SNE — that allows users to manipulate embeddings on-the-fly, which hopefully results in more intuitive embeddings. To this end, the two main tools are the dragging and fixing of datapoints, and the altering/shaping of clusters by changing the high-dimensional similarities. As an example of the latter, imagine one apparent cluster in a t-SNE embed…]]></summary>

 I spent a lot of time finding near-duplicates on multiple data records. That s why I build a model which finds near duplicate records from various tables/CSV and flags them according to the difference score. So I can filter these records and handle them. For example, one branch puts a user ID like “0001763,” and the other one uses “xxx1763, 01763, (branchid)1763”. 
 So, do you think that kind of model could be helpful for other companies? 
 Note: let me know if it a self promotion, I will not do that again.

  - Nested Folders
  - Lots of context menus
  - Response history
  - Plugins
  - Runs fully in the browser and runs offline if necessary
  - Chrome and Firefox extension to bypass CORS restrictions
  - Desktop builds for all platforms
  - GraphQL support
  - Import collections exported from Postman and Insomnia
  - Simple user friendly interface

If you're tired of Postman's bloated interface and slow startup times, do give this a try.

 But things have changed dramatically since 1984. The Soviet Union is now in a state of turmoil. Once again the cold war has begun, with Russia struggling to hold its grip on its nuclear arsenal. The Cold War never ended, but instead morphed into a nightmare. War is coming closer, more easily than ever before.
 Media in the West see the new nuclear arms race as a political issue, about how long the West can sustain an arms race that goes on indefinitely. But Russia sees it much differently: It sees a war that begins one day. It might not seem that bad. But on the day it begins, the Soviets say they'll have e…]]></summary>

 Any recommendations would be great. I studied architecture and I’m looking to learn more about ML and how this can develop the built environment!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been quite demotivated in my job for a couple of months now and I feel like I need a place to vent. I started a data science career 4 years ago transitioning from an engineering (not software) background. My first job was at a rather large company (2000+ fte) but it is mostly tech company so it was quite a good experience. I grew my knowledge quite fast and was loving it but after 18 months or so I feel like we had reached the ceiling of our impact as a team and we were just kind of doing marginal improvements and trying to find other projects to work on without success. 
 I left the job after 2 years and started at a small company (30 fte) as the only and first data scientist with complete greenfield. Although the company is small, it has many users and a lot of data and I saw an opportunity to make large impact quickly. Now a year later, I have build and experimented with just about everything I could think of but the impact has only been marginal. If I was the owner of this company I would say data science is not worth the cost. I'm now at a point where I think companies are very eager to hire people to do ML / Data science without understanding that it's not always generating value for the business.
 At the same time, I'm realising I enjoy more all the engineering type tasks that I do over modelling or analysis to a point that I'm considering applying for SE type jobs rather than continuing in DS. 
 Has anyone here been through the same or similar thought process?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I've been working with Data Science/Machine Learning/Linear Programming etc for almost 5 years now. Basically the "too mathematical for software developers/data engineers, too much code for maths/science folks" category- you know the gist.
 What I have noticed is that Data Science either gets treated as a traditional software development team or a BI team. Both of which I think are quite bad. Of course there's a surge of MLOps which is "standardising" shipping and maintaining ML in production, but it doesn't focus too much on actually developing the models. 
 Software Development treatment: Here you lose a lot of flexibility in experimentation, research, model exploration and frankly the failure rate in Data Science projects is relatively high compared to other fields in tech (some things just can't be solved with ML/maths, or simply it is not worth it). Normal software development timelines don't make sense in most cases especially since you rely a lot on backend/data engineers/frontend/product before you even start a project.
 BI treatment: Well you have 500 scripts, notebooks, analysis spread all around you. There's very little code reviews, basic software development procedures, it's basically the wild west 🤠. The infrastructure gets built by people who have very little clue (or time) about any of this. Retraining, deployment are a nightmare. Whatever benefit you get in actually have in building the models, you surely loose all of it as soon as your work gets into production. 
 How do your teams function and structure the work around this? Do you feel this is a bit chaotic or am I the only one? What tools are you using? I know this is a very broad topic but just wondering. 
 P.S I am very new to reddit not a clue on how this works.

This project is about traffic surveillance and basically, I decided to classify just into two classes the objects: vehicles for heavy weight and small vehicles. The mean purpose is to ensure that vehicles for heavyweight are in their exclusive lane.
 So, I was wondering if you could give me feedback about the classes, maybe is better to define more classes or it is ok with just two? In the end, it could be faster to process real-time Images.
 Also, if anyone has some advice for video collecting because I’m going to film some videos on this particular highway and then use them to train with YOLO. I’m going to film from a pedestrian bridge. I read some suggestions about the different brightness pictures to make a more robust model. But if you have any other advice I would appreciate it.
