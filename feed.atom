        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, as You can read in the title I have a dataset with 50 columns. My first aproach is to do a PCA for dimensionality reduction, before i do that, i Made a correlation analysis and drop some columns. Before Made a PCA and using gbdt( xgboost ) and a rf regressor.
 But My results aren't good r2=0.55 that is only 0.05 better than a baseline.
 I don't have any bussines context to improve My analisis.
 Some ideas to handle this problem

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s no other way for me to describe it so I’ll say it like it is.
 I have symphonies of music in my head. I think in music. My problem is I have a hand disability so I can’t produce the music I create in any tangible way. I can hum the music in parts but I was wondering…
 Is there an AI music generator where I can hum a melody, tell it what instrument to use, and it will produce that melody in that instrument for me so I can slowly build up my entire song?
 I’ve been able to think in music like this since I was 12 but I could never show anyone. I want to show them now that AI has become powerful enough.
 Any help is gratefully appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'd love some clarification on these dimensionality reduction methods. I see PCA/PCR recommended as the go-to method for this type of task and almost never see people talk about using PLS to get principal components. It's my understanding that the key difference is that PLS considers the target when making components. 
 Intuitively, I feel like this would make PLS stronger in many datasets, as it uses more of the available information to better inform the creation of components. I'm not an expert here and don't actually have a ton of expertise with how either of these methods work on a deep level, so any feedback from more experienced data scientists would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance for any thoughts or opinions here!

 If you look up 80s aesthetic on google or youtube you always get the same sort of synthwave type art-style which although reminiscent to 80s aesthetics, it ends up being overly bright colors with bright neon etc. ai seems to actually capture the 80s aesthetics perfectly even without a drop of neon! if you watch the so and so as an 80s fantasy/sci fi on youtube you can get exactly what I mean. it looks just like a shot from an 80s action movie.
 Does anyone actually know why the ai will go for this style instead of the pseudo synthwave 80s aesthetic that has been popularized? is this just a byproduct of art breeder itself? I haven't checked to see if other ai is doing it also. 
 Here are some pictures of actual 80s and early 90s movies to see what I mean.

 Today I got the amazing news that I am accepted for the MSc in Data Science. As someone with a Bachelors in Finance (also included Stats,Maths and Programming electives). I wanted to know would you recommend being data scientist in the banking or finance sector? (With this I also mean are the working hours decent and do you have a social life, and are you allowed to WFH)
 Thank you in advance for your answers
 Kind Regards,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to showcase a new initiative from AINow that is designed to help you explore the full potential of AI. With so many AI tools on the market, it can be overwhelming and expensive to determine which ones are right for you. That's why we've decided to take AI education to the next level and give our subscribers access to the latest AI tools, all for free!
 Here's how it works: At the start of each week, our subscribers will vote on the tools they would like to try out and learn how to use. Based on the votes, we will get in touch with the company and secure free access for our subscribers. Then, throughout the rest of the week, we will be providing in-depth tutorials and tips on how to best use the tool. This way, you can try out multiple AI tools, determine which ones work best for your projects, and find your fit in the AI world without having to pay a monthly fee.
 At AINow, we believe that AI should be accessible and understandable to everyone. That's why we're removing the barriers that may have held you back from exploring the full potential of AI. Our expert insights will help you get the most out of each tool and give you the knowledge you need to succeed. Whether you're just starting out or are looking to expand your AI skills, AINow is your one-stop-shop for cutting-edge AI education.
 Sign up here if you are interested in becoming apart of this initiative. 
 To those that made it this far: thank you for taking the time to read this. If you have any questions about this, leave them in the comments and I will try my best to answer them.
 Best regards, 
 The AINow Team

 To help it guide you, you need to provide it with some context based on the job description. For example, you list out the job description to ChatGPT and say that you want to be asked questions on causality and experimentation.
 Here's the response from ChatGPT based on the following prompt I provided it after sharing the job description:
 ===PROMPT BY ME===

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 I'm working on a pet-project where I'm trying to predict rental prices in a city. I web scrapped data from Facebook Marketplace, but now I'm facing a problem. When I'm trying to extract the areas of the properties, I'm getting a lot of NaN values (~80%). I'm not sure how to deal with them correctly.
 I was thinking about using the mean or median values based on specific property type, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. I would appreciate any suggestions or advice on how to handle these NaN values.
 Thanks in advance for your help!

 After some googling, I found this (but for M1 chip Mac) --I wonder if I'm stuck. Is this laptop just not up for the job of working with sentence transformers? Appreciate your advice

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need someone to tell me I'm not crazy. I work with a vendor for our learning management system. Each course, curriculum, etc. all have a subject you can apply and the subjects can be nested. Here is an example of a simple example use case:
 AUDIO
 ---SPEAKERS
 ------BL
 ------DAS AUDIO
 ---MICROPHONES
 ------WIRED
 ------WIRELESS
 My issue is that when filtering by AUDIO, for example, there are no results from ANYTHING below it... only things that are in that top level category.
 I opened a trouble ticket and this is the response I received:
  
We do understand your concern.
 We tested the same scenario in our local environment and found that if we search parent subject (Top level), the child LO is not returned in the search results.
 This is as designed, this only searches using the subject select and does not include child subjects.
 As a workaround, when the subjects are set up in training, you can also add the parent and child both subjects so that both will be displayed in the Search.
  
I'm 95% sure this is a dumb answer, right? As in, if it wasn't going to be included in the search for the parent, then it's not really a nested "child" subject... it's just a... completely different subject.
 I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!

 The model doesn't generate entirely new videos, it creates videos from the ones you upload, using text or image prompts to apply effects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working with a binary classification dataset with many features, and not much info about them. I made an extra trees classifier with an F1 of 0.99. I believe the data originated from a synthetic source, so I’ll take that 0.99 as viable. 
 Anyway, the many features give the most important ones about a 0.02 influence by itself. My question is, how can I see how these features may work together to influence the outcome? For example , perhaps features 3, 21, 78 create a 0.15 impact together. 
 Any insight is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I started using ChatGPT to gather literature references for my scientific project. Love the information it gives me, clear, accurate and so far correct. It will also give me papers supporting these findings when asked. 
 HOWEVER, none of these papers actually exist. I can't find them on google scholar, google, or anywhere else. They can't be found by title or author names. When I ask it for a DOI it happily provides one, but it either is not taken or leads to a different paper that has nothing to do with the topic. I thought translations from different languages could be the cause and it was actually a thing for some papers, but not even the english ones could be traced anywhere online.
 Does ChatGPR just generate random papers that look damn much like real ones?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I am a beginner in data analytics and I find it very interesting. For a school project we have a case where company A only has a ERP system where all the transactions happen and it is connected to a single Database(SQL). The question in this case is what solution would be appropiate because the company doesn't have the manpower and budget to maintain data analytics.
 We have learned the basics of ETL, Data warehousing with the Visual Studio tool and connection with SSIS package. But I did some research and found out you can do ETL in powerBI. But how reliable is this? And do you have to keep changing the relationsships in PowerBI everytime you want to make a dashboard or does it stay like that? I need to make a few KPI and dasboards for this school project.
 Thanks for advance responses

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was not happy in my job for a while. Dead-end project, under-resourced, people leaving constantly.
 I spoke up a number of times in how unhappy I am but my boss took it semi-seriously and didn't really take much action.
 I recently got a new offer, although only 12% higher total package. Seems like this offer is for more interesting work and generally in a more dynamic environment. It's a downgrade in title and offers a bit less security though.
 I attempted to resign today but my boss promised me a new project and a new team. While it will take maybe a couple of months to tie up lose ends, my boss is generally trustworthy. He seemed genuinely distressed and sad that I am thinking of leaving.
 I don't know what to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had an interview with an interesting question. I had a solution that would have worked which would have required a recursive query, but the interviewer said there is a simpler solution. I was wondering if anyone here could figure it out
 Four column table:
  1. UserID- unique string 2. Device Id- unique string 3. session_start_time- timestamp 4. session_end_time- timestamp 
 It's possible for users with different deviceIds to have overlapping sessions. The goal is to have one row per user per overlapping session. So let's say that I have a session on my phone from 10:30-11:30, and on my computer from 10:45-11:45. The goal would be to aggregate this into a single row:
  UserId|session_start|session_end aaquad|10:30|11:45 
 My strategy was to use a lag to bring up the next row in order to be able to compare them- and the recursion would have been required in cases where a user had 3 or more overlapping sessions. But according to the interviewer, there is a different solution (I asked and did not get the answer).
 Any ideas?
