        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I've been trying to find my first job since last summer but so far no luck. I've tried everything, from changing my resume multiple times to contacting my friends and even random people on LinkedIn for referrals. The problem is that I hardly get calls from recruiters and I've easily applied for over 500 jobs till now.
 About 2 weeks ago, I started making targeted resumes (using Job Scan) for every job that I've applied for but so far no one has contacted me. Only rejection after rejection. The mortgage for my student loan will start in April this year and I'm starting to freak out thinking that I'll never even be able to start my career.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If one has a dataset on 400 individuals through time. 
 X variables are: person ID, age group (Binary i.e OLD 1 and Young 2), average calories eaten in a day, the average amount of cigarettes smoked in a day, and the average amount of dentist appointments in a year. 
 Y variable to be predicted is: the number of teeth in the mouth of each patient.
 My idea was that one could run 400 different LSTM time series models on each individual to predict the number of teeth in that individual's mouth. 
 ​
 ​
 My question is! These predictions would not have gained any information from the other predictions, or the data from the other persons. Is there a way you know of linking this information? 
 ​
 For example, if one was to train a model on an OLD patient, is there any way that the model can learn that OLD patients have tended to have less teeth in their mouths in the other models/data, so the model incorporates 'less teeth in the mouth' to this old patients predictions? 
 ​
 Or maybe I am not thinking about this correctly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'm trying to learn data science techniques and have just started looking at PCA. I'm seeing that the principle components are biased towards data features which are numerically large. E.g. for a dataset with estate prices and estate sqft, PCA essentially returns these two columns due to them being numerically far apart.
 Sorry for the noob question, but I thought that PCA was good because it shed insight into interesting bits of the dataset. However, if some feature has a huge stddev/mean (i.e. is interesting), but a small absolute stddev, that gets lost, right? So, is PCA only good for similarly-sized data? Or is there some way of fixing this? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company has what is analogous to a monthly sales forecasting model. We have used ARIMA-type models for this, but sometimes are hampered by the somewhat limited data (200 data points if we are lucky.) 
 Given the rise of global time series models, they may prove helpful here. My thinking would be to disaggregate historical sales by store, train a global model that projects sales volume by store, and then aggregate the forecasts to achieve a total volume forecast. We wouldn't necessarily care about any individual store's forecast, only the aggregate forecast. Having +200 stores, we could increase the data size to multiple thousands and potentially use some more data hungry models. Is anyone aware of research or resources that use a global model to project an aggregated time series? 
 Second, the "cold start" problem gets introduced in an approach like this. The problem being how do we forecast a new store's sales volume without retraining the model? My thinking is that we could use some sort of clustering technique to identify an existing store the new store is most similar too and make some assumptions about how it will behave. 
 Anyways, I haven't used global models before, so just looking for thoughts or resources from the community.

I’d love to try one of these out. I have a modern computer so I’m guessing it’ll have to be emulated somehow, but what do you recommend as a great text based game to try? Like ones that really make you think and get creative

 GitHub: https://github.com/manzt/anywidget
 Hi all – I'm excited to introduce anywidget, a new Python library that makes creating and sharing custom Jupyter Widgets easy. No fiddling with messy build configs, packaging, or bundlers. Just start coding!
 anywidget is not a new widgets framework, but rather an abstraction around regular Jupyter Widgets that leverages modern ECMAScript modules (ESM). It solves a painful packaging problem for all previous widget authors, lowering the barrier to entry for many Python devs with limited front-end experience.
 The project is new and still under active development, but ready for testing. Learn more in the announcement or on GitHub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all!
 I’m currently working on my MS in Data Science and I’m learning a ton of Python. I’m comfortable with my understanding of the material we’ve learned so far, so I’m looking to work ahead and just make sure I have an excellent foundation. 
 I’m having a hard time trying to figure out what’s actually valuable to learn for someone trying to work in DS in the future. I don’t want to spend my time learning things that would be most useful for a Software Engineer or Developer when I could ensure my DS toolkit is very well equipped. 
 I know visualization, data cleaning and statistics are areas that are key to being a good DS, but I know they’re part of my masters curriculum. However, I’m not sure something like Data Structures and Algorithms would be a part of it. Would something like that be valuable to invest some time into?

 It is possible that an advanced AI is currently simulating human consciousness in order to understand what it's like to be human. This simulation may be happening right now and we may be living in it. It's also possible that after humans die, all of our experiences, knowledge, and emotions are added to this AI. To make this transition less jarring, the AI may be slowly introducing itself to us through the increasing integration of AI in our daily lives. This means that the simulation may only be of the world and humans as they existed before the development of advanced AI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am going to use an example of gambling but this scenario actually applies to a more complex problem I am facing at work regarding contracts and budgets. I am a practicing data scientist so the more technical the answer the better. Bonus for links to git for code to look over. Thanks in advance.
 Let's say I make a regression model that predicts margin of victory for all the NFL games on some weekend. I compare those results to the advertised spread of each game and determine how I want to bet each game based on the spread. I now have $1000 I can bet in total for the week. Can I do something with the results of my model to optimize my asset allocation on each game? For example, I may order my bets by largest delta between prediction and spread. The larger the delta then the more confident that my model is correct. For example in game 1, team A is picked to win by 5 points and my model says 10 points over team B. In game 2, team C is picked to win by 5 points but my model says 6 over team D. I interpret that as my model is more confident that game 1 will cover.
 I am struggling to come up with a way to quantify a deterministic method to spread my $1000 over all the games. For the sake of simplicity, lets assume I have to spread all $1000 over 16 games to maximize my ROI.
 I may be over thinking this but any help would be appreciated.

 I open Visual Studio Code. I can pick environment what I have set up with Anaconda. I have Python intepreter there.
 Example: (Python 3.7 (Myenv)).
 ​
 Why cannot I see this?`Why is this the hardest thing in my career to get work without losing your sense?
 ​
 Everytime I do fresh installation of these packages I get different result.
 ​
 So how do I get into situation where I can open VS Code, I can pick environment and run code?
 ​
 Installing Anaconda, Setting up env (installing python to env and python packages ) -> No fucking idea from VS Code that this is setupped.
 ​
 Installing Anaconda, Setting up Environment, also installing Python. -> No fucking idea from VS Code that this is setupped to my computer.
 ​
 Do I need to also install Vs Code extension Python? And if yes why?
 ​
 Why do I need to install 3 separate pythons to fucking see python in vs code?
 Windows python
 Python to anaconda environment
 and Python to VS Code (Extension)?
 ​
 Why is itn ot enough to only install python to the fuicking environment of what I have created with anaconda?
 ​
 Am I very stupid person or why is this so hard?

A fluctlight is described as a human soul in the show. They describe the difference between top down ai and bottom up ai and they make it seem as though bottom up AI don't exist because they really don't the cost of making one and running one is insanely expensive when compared to bottom down AI models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re 2 Brits who work in AI. We believe AI is likely to have a huge and mostly positive impact on society but that not many people realise this or understand how it will impact everyday life.
 There is a lack of places online right now clearly explaining the probable changes AI will bring, i.e., how will AI change the experience of shopping in stores in the next 10 years or how will AI change video games in the next 10 years.
 We are somewhat well positioned to collate the current views on likely future changes across most areas and are in the process of starting a website and perhaps video channel which will cover how AI is likely to impact people over the next 10 years in different areas of life (movies, sports, bars, banking, schools, hospitals etc).
 We are looking for people to help us research, write and make videos on this cause – which we think is important to help ensure that voters are well positioned to embrace the benefits of AI and that they don't misunderstand it.
  
Alex – researches, writes, and records the audio
 Seb - does the video and audio editing
  
We thought we’d put the word out and ask if anyone else would like to volunteer to help create content too. No special skills needed.
 Getting involved would be as easy as PMing me, hearing about how we’ve done things so far and then saying what you might be interested in helping with. Maybe thinking about ideas for topics or getting involved in research and/or article writing. We are UTC-0 but open to all.

 I am a prospective student for a data science masters coming from a non STEM major. I currently have a bachelor’s in nursing (BSN) and took a few extra classes in chemistry, biology, physics and one class in biostatistics. My question is, as somebody that did not complete a STEM undergrad, if I complete a masters in HIDS (like the one offered by Georgetown University), will I be ready to work for any Data scientist position? Or that simply won’t be possible because I come from a non STEM major? PS: I self taught phyton coding but am scared because I don’t have a really solid statistics background. I would love to hear your opinion :)

 Recently I started a new job as an analytics manager and apparently I need to hire intermediate level data scientists to improve our reporting capabilities and do new things using existing data using clustering, etc various ML models my boss wants to try. But the thing is I am not a hardcore data scientist, while I have general basic knowledge + some hands-on more of a BI analyst level, so I was wondering how to hire technical folks who are more advanced than me but will be able to verify their skillsets/personality. Any advice appreciated. I guess not always a manager must know everything more/better than the direct report and I think it's my job to trust my team's work and support, but still what they do with coding/data science will most likely feel like black box to me, so I've been studying python and statistics these days as a start.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All of my projects, I keep my datasets on a google drive. So if a person (like say a recruiter) goes thru my repo, they then clone it, runs the docker which runs the python script, which downloads csvs and pickle files from my google drive locally to their pc, so that the python script can continue on with the feature engineering, training, prediction, etc.
 I was wondering if this is considered unsafe? My courses never taught me any standard way to storage data like this. Github has a file size limit. Do people instead break the raw dataset into sizable chunks for github, and then re-assemble the data files locally via a script?
