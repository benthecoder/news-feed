        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New to this sub and wanted to see if anyone used Data Science outside of a 9-5 job, as either a way to monetize (making tutorial videos, analyzing investments, etc.) or to build a portfolio. I'm relatively new to working in Data Science and want to help build familiarize myself with projects that I find interesting.
 Any tips/ideas/starting points would be appreciated.

 Over the last 5 years I have worked for several companies as an Analytics Engineer (implementing tracking and tagging solutions) and Data Manager. 
 My job normally included getting a picture of online and offline data and unite them. 
 In each company I started auditing the different data and marketing platforms to understand the data structure, naming conventions and platform integration status. 
 All of the companies I worked for had a big problem with old, cluttered and incorrect data.
 In one company we ripped out the complete tagging and tracking system and set up a brand new tag management system and platform end points (mainly Google Analytics, Databricks and some other platforms)

 I asked the bloke what his PC at home goes up to, and he implied most storage is taken up by programs so 75GB is more than enough for files.
 Nobody in this organisation (4000+ people) have ever exceeded 75GB. Wtf??
 One typical csv file is 1GB, how is this happening in such a large organisation?? My god.
 Edit: this is Onedrive space. We’re unable to store things locally

 I have some experience using PostgreSQL a few years back, but I want to stay present and have a project I can point to on my GitHub. 
 I’ve used DataCamp to lightly brush up on skills, but what’s the best way to incorporate SQL into an analysis project from something like a web scraped data set? I’ve had success doing this in Python top to bottom but I’m definitely getting rusty on my SQL. 
 (Note: I actually cannot use it for work projects because I need admin privileges to download Postgres and a draconian worksheet to justify the download) 
 Advice?

 A LONG time ago, I was trying the TensorFlow library for Mac M1, and from that time, I created lots of environments, installed Miniforge as my base environment. Today, looking at this, I am confused how to mess with this clutter, and how to setup Anaconda(OR Miniforge) and conda virtual Environment for a Virtual Studio Code ML project.

 For those people who can help out, I have questions now:
  
Is it better to use Anaconda software distribution for Mac M1? I intend to use TensorFlow as my ML library?
 Or should I use Miniforge software distribution for Mac M1? 
  
I might have more questions as I understand which distribution to use. If you need any info from me, please don't hesitate to ask me! Thank you in advance!!!

 It kind of blew my mind how useful it was so I wanted to ask what other automation tools do you know about that can be used in data science and are maybe not so well known about? Looking for inspiration.

 I made an app where you can chat with the AI-powered digital twin of a real person, it’s called “Get Cheezy With Dr. Aaron Ozee”.Aaron Ozee is a celebrity writer and children’s book author, but also he’s a friend of mine and it was cool to work together to create something so fundamentally new. The avatar is super realistic, he moves, sounds, and talks like Aaron himself, all because AI models, such as TTS, lipsync and the conversational engine based on LLM.
 Here is an app, if you want to try:
 https://apps.apple.com/app/get-cheezy-with-dr-aaron-ozee/id1642331303
 Next, I want to make a tool where everyone can create their own character and share it with friends and followers. I believe this will revolutionize 1-to-many direct communication.
 I would love to hear your feedback, do you think this technology can scale our most valuable resource — time?

 It is cool to see it replace a profession when you are not from that field but if you are it will leave you without.
 It can and will do wonderful things but at the rate it is advancing (which will only get faster) most jobs will stop existing, what will people even do for a living when AI can do everything, faster and better?

 The goverments don't want to gift you money, they live from you and if they did give you money chances are it would be under some kind of strict social credit slavery that will barely allow you to live (if they outright don't start killing people).

Help each other, ask questions, brainstorm, etc. There is just so much benefit to joining a community when you are in this field, especially when you cannot find the question you are looking for on stack overflow! 😉
 This is the same thing with AI, which is why I created a Discord server two years ago. Where anyone learning or working in the field could come and share their projects, learn together, work together, and much more. The community is now close to 30'000 members, which is unbelievable!
 Likewise, if you are just tinkering with ChatGPT, DALLE or MidJourney. Come join us and share your creations and the projects/companies/products you build (or find your next co-founder)!
 So glad to see it growing and see everyone so active. We have partnered with Towards AI to provide qualitative events, live streams, a community newsletter, free courses following recent developments, job opportunities, and more!
 p.s. we are always looking for contributors to our different projects (answer questions, moderation, help with open-source resources, podcast hosts...). Please reach out to me if interested! We also have some budget or cool merch we can send out :) 
 Come join us if you are in the AI field !

 [Picture of a traffic simulation in Unreal Engine]
 I put together a blog this morning (https://whiteowleducation.substack.com/p/why-are-simulations-the-future-of) that builds off of a reddit discussion from yesterday.
 I am genuinely curious though. Are any of you using simulations for your day-to-day work?
 I ask because I see reports of the following:
  
Nvidia using simulations for weather prediction
 BMW using simulations in order to optimize factory layout
 There have been recent discoveries in Nuclear Fusion, and I have to believe that simulations were used to help set up those experiments.
 I even see traffic Jams being simulated in Unreal Engine
  
​
 Traffic Jam simulations are even photorealistic. 
 Long story short, it seems like people are doing simulations, but would this go under the "data science" job title, or is there a different profession that does this kind of work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[trigger alert - depressing post/rant ahead.
 Our company cut its workforce by 33%, and our team shrank from 7 couples of working hands to 3. Most of the layoffs came after a long year of poor management and disconnection from evidence, which makes it even more infuriating. 
 Besides the fact that now the current work will be divided among fewer people, I am sad that my friends got laid off, and feel lonely. In most cases, the DS/research team is somewhat isolated from the rest of the organization, making you an alien, having only three of us left, leaving me with very few people to talk to. 
 I know it comes out a little funny that I am the one to complain after people lose their job. I really and truly feel sorry for them as well (thinking about their situation makes me sick and angry even more, as, again, the layoffs result from poor management). I just don't know how to deal with it, it's my first job after grad school, and stopping seeing friends whom I saw 3-4 times a week (and even more on evenings) really hits me hard (more than I thought it could).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have someone in my team who is currently applying for one of the internal roles - a promotion 2 levels above her current level. I am on the interview panel but not her referee and therefore have to remain unbiased and take the information that was presented in the CV like I would for an external applicant.
 This person has no technical skills, no understanding behind even simple concepts, just memorized a few things but is very interested in promotions and started asking about them 6 months into the role. Seems way more interested in promotions than learning DS :(
 Anyway, I have seen plenty of people add about 20% to their CV, overstate their role in a project etc. This person has claimed that she has built 2 models that don't exist as a part of my team. She described techniques used and claims she has led the whole effort and the models are now deployed (these are techniques that I mentioned in team meetings, but always said that it will depend on the data. Turns out we didn't have enough good data so looks like these models will never be built. She is up to date on these developments). I am in a very large org and nobody really keeps track of new models etc.
 On the basis of these lies, I have seen that she was invited for an interview. Many people that are way more talented but were more honest didn't. This really bothers me. I did mention it to my manager who seems disinterested and made a comment that I need to be building up junior DS and not tearing them down :(
 This is more of a vent than anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If the interviews were in-person, I’d dress up nicely, like I would do physically going into the office. But what would you wear for online DS interviews (not a managerial role)? I’m clearly at home, as the background in the camera (even when blurred) shows, and I find wearing a nice office shirt at home a bit awkward. I noticed most DS people are pretty casual when it comes to appearances as well, so not sure what’s the dress code for such situations.
 Also, if you’re hiring, what would you expect the candidate to wear? And would you look negatively at a candidate who decided to wear a hoodie?

I was thinking of becoming a data scientist but I'm not really sure what I need to study or what the job entails. Would appreciate if any current data scientists could give me some insight as to what their jobs are like or what I would need to know/study to get into the field. Also I know there are job opportunities in the field but I'm not sure what prospects are available(companies I'd be working at e.t.c.). Note! I'm not completely sold on the field and i was also looking at software development as a potential career path, would appreciate if someone could give me some pros and cons of the 2 fields. Thank you!
