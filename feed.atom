        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent trials publicized have gotten me wondering how limited the average knowledge on law is, especially my own, and then I got to wonder how data scientists ensure their work is legal and if their is more pay in having that knowledge. How important is understanding laws relating to data for data scientists, more than a general understanding of domain-specific laws such as PII, PHI, HIPPA, FERPA, and general privacy laws? Is there a niche or need for data scientists who also are educated on current laws relevant to the field/data in general or is the law around it still evolving too fast for such specialization? Are there many companies that are looking for this skillset or do they prefer to allocate all that to a law firm/in-house lawyers?
 TLDR: are legal and compliance data paid more and are they in need?

 I started learning about data science and analytics a few months ago and I'm fascinated! Sounds like a very interesting job with a great future! But I realized that it will be a very long journey and I don't know people with the same interests and goals, so I'm here trying to find more people interested in this who want to be in an active study group with me. (:
 I'm a 28M, studied Chemical Engineering, and worked for a few years on my own, so I don't have a background in data science. My plan was to study for a few months and start applying for a data analyst job after January, but a few weeks ago I applied for a position at a market research company because I thought it seemed interesting and I AM IN THE LAST STEP OF THE HIRING PROCESS! So I'm very close to getting a job re…]]></summary>

 For 0; precision:0.81 , recall: 1.00 f1-score 0.89 For 1; precision: 0.63, recall: 0.03, f1-score 0.05
 What is causing this discrepancy? The data is imbalanced with 4,771 0 values and 1,189 1 values.
 I have already used GridSearchCV, StratifiedKFold to find optimal class weights to try to fix the imbalance. Results improved and worsened to; 0.34,0.59,0.43.
 Any help is appreciated!

 In my current role I utilize python and while I have a grasp of the basics of data wrangling and putting together ad-hoc analyses, i'm trying to improve my skills to the point where a disgruntled data engineer wont have to do a total redo all of my code. At this point given the current stage my company is at, there aren't any production-level data pipelines and ML models that I can look at to learn from.
 Are there any online resources / git hub repositories that feature examples of production-level data science projects / and or scripts that experienced data scientists/ML engineers here would consider "well-written" and good to learn from?

 A client is giving us a ridiculous amount of footage, and they're asking us to find certain people in long clips, which takes forever to do manually. It would be fantastic if we could use some kind of tool that has AI/facial recognition and automatic tagging to run this footage through (as long as it's faster than going through it manually). Do you know of anything like that?

I'm looking for a good AI that'll give me responses with enough depth, and hopefully aren't a single sentence. I'll be asking it about its existence so I want it to answer questions like "What do you see?", and "Who are you?" with enough detail to be interesting to a viewer. Hopefully there's one that can do all this and has a face and voice but that's not too important.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you read guidelines for commenting code, they typically prescribe commenting with why you are doing something but not what you are doing or how. The delineation is somewhat fuzzy, but the idea is that your comments should not be akin to:
 "Doing X to ensure M. Accomplish this in 3 steps: 1. Do y. 2. Do z. 3. Do w." 
 But rather should be:
 "Doing X to ensure M."
 I find this puzzling. Yes, there MAY be a disconnect between what someone SAYS the code does and what it ACTUALLY does. But this is a feature not a bug: if we review code with the same scrutiny as we would without the additional comments, being able to check that the code does what the author says it does is the easiest way of reviewing the actual implementation of logic of the code.
 In other words, if each line of code does what the comment says it does, it does not mean the code overall accomplishes what it should. However, if each line DOESN'T do what it says it does, then it means the code overall DOES NOT accomplish what the author thinks it does. 
 IMO the only downside/risk to more verbose comments is maintenence of the comments as code changes. This is a hazard as comments cannot be subject to testing, but presumably comment review is as important as actual code review. 
 Am I missing something? Transitioning from academic and government research to private sector data scientist, the sparsity of comments has proven the biggest change and barrier to picking up others' projects. Even with standardized style, it can take ages to figure out someone's hacked together solution or sufficiently general code to see how it applies to the problem at hand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is a simplified illustration of my problem. Note, I am using a Linear Mixed Effects model with a binomial link function, as I need to account for another categorical feature, and I need the model to be as interpretable as possible.
 Suppose I have 2 features (A and B) that I have found to have importance on predicting a binary outcome, Y. Feature A’s type is ordinal values from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6}, with a linear negative correlation with P(Y).
 Feature B is a continuous value between 0 and 1, however, it is not definable when Feature A = 1. For all other values of Feature A, Feature B has a weaker but significant linear positive correlation with P(Y).
 Any idea how I could deal with this? Options I’ve considered, but not yet tested are - Have separate models/mixed effect groups for when Feature A = 1 and when Feature A != 1 - Set Feature B to some arbitrary(?) extreme value when Feature A = 1 - Impute Feature B with its mean when Feature A = 1
 Any thoughts on those, or alternative ideas would be really appreciated!
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm training a machine learning model using YOLOv5 from Ultralytics (arch: YOLOv5s6). The task is to detect and identify laundry symbols. For that, I've scraped and labeled 600 images from Google.
 Using this dataset, I receive a result with an mAP around 0.6.
 But 600 images is a tiny dataset and there are multiple laundry symbols where I have only 1-4 images for training and symbols where I have 100 and more.
 So I started writing a Python script which generates more images of laundry symbols. The script basically takes a background image and adds randomly positioned 1-10 laundry symbols in different colors and rotations. No background is used twice. With that script, I generated around 6.000 entirely different images with laundry symbols that every laundry symbol is at least 800 times in the dataset.
 Here are examples of the generated data: Link 1 Link 2
 I combined the scraped and the generated dataset and retrained the model with the same configuration. The result is really bad: the mAP dropped to 0.15 and the model overfits. The confusion matrix told me why: Confusion matrix
 Why is the model learning the background instead the objects?
 First I thought my annotation might be wrong, but the training script from Ultralytics saves a few examples of training batch images - there the boxes are drawn perfectly around the generated symbols.
 For completeness, below are more analytics added about the training:

 Labels Curves More examples from the dataset

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to forecast some data - the data isn't necessarily linear but I am limited by what I have access to (SQL Server and SSRS) so I have forecasted using line regression. I need to include a confidence interval so I have done so as shown in the first picture (99%). 
 The issues I have with this are 
  
It seems awfully narrow - equation used is 2.576*SD/sqrt(n) = 0.473 (I have tried both normal distribution and t distribution and they give the same answer - n = 30 so its right on the threshold for now). 
 
We are looking for something that fans out as the sample size increases as shown in the second picture. So far the only solution I have been able to figure out is by modifying the slopes of the max and min forecast lines but that takes away the statistical accuracy. 
 
 Is there any form of confidence interval that affects the slope? Or a CI specifically meant for time series?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have just finished my master's in business administration and started looking for my first job in data analytics or data science. I have had 6 courses about programming, and one of them was basically about the completion of 4 data science projects. My master's thesis was a great pain for me, but I managed to make it work (simulation with evolution algorithm for a popular logistics problem). I am also learning some stuff from my family on the run (my brother is doing a computer science degree, my husband is a data engineer). In addition, I have speedrun one popular data science course on some online learning platform, where I also had some data science related stuff to do. I made the course quickly since I had already learned most of the stuff at the university.
 Now I am starting…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Author note: The original title is “Property based testing: tale of two shrinkers”, which is retroactively a bit bad title choice on my part; the title I submitted it under sums the content up better I believe.
This is a talk I gave internally at my company (I’m also planning to give an updated version at Haskell Exchange 2022 in a month or so), about approaches to shrinking in PBT libraries and their issues, and how the Hypothesis approach (“internal shrinking”) solves those issues yet remains mostly unknown. There’s also a bit of a call to action to PBT library maintainers to adopt this approach at the end :)
I’m a co-maintainer of elm-test, the Elm PBT library, which has historically used the rose tree approach (second one mentioned in the video) and recently switched to the internal shrinking approach in v2.0.0. We like it so far!

 I have a list of 400 bug reports.
  
Bug report 1: The search bar is not working
 Bug report 2: I generally like the website but searching through the search bar is not working
 Bug report 3: My account is locked
 Bug report 4: Searching doesn't work
  
Etc. etc. etc - and the list goes on!
 Now - as you can see, there are a lot of similarities! For instance, bug reports about the 'Search bar' or 'Searching' occur quite often (3/4 in this case).
 But, it would be an insane pain to read through all the 400 reports and try to mark down the similarities / occurrences. Imagine if the list is hundreds of inputs long.
 Therefore - is there some kind of AI tool wherein you can input a certain list and it exports certain grouping of similarities? So, it'd tell me: "The Word 'Search' came up in 3/4 bug reports and is the most reported"

 I have managed to write a script in python (using PyCharm) that can extract data from PDF files.
 However, my script uses a link to the PDF to 'open' it.
 Now I need to turn it into a service that can be accessed by other people online and the desired output is: 
 They drag the PDF file and get the data + data is also stored in a database.
 ​
 Seems a lil overwhelming right now and I was wondering you someone here might help me look in the right direction or online tutorials on yt maybe.
 Thanks for any and all help in advance!

 I am a Product Analyst, and I work with several PM's to get them the data that they need- nothing fancy, they really just want csv's that they can load into pivot tables. For reasons not in my control, we are not doing dashboards (not my call), and I need to get multiple PM's multiple files on a regular basis. 
 I am using Jupyter notebook hooked up directly to our Redshift database. I figured I could save myself some work by uploading the notebooks to Google Colab (the company is already on G-Suite), and then the PM's can just run the script, which will automatically pull the data, do the manipulations, and download the CSV for them to use. 
 When I tried this, notebooks that ran in 2 minutes or less in Jupyter resulted in run times so long in Colab that the connection to Redshift was shut down.
 Any ideas on why Colab is taking so much longer to connect to Redshift?
