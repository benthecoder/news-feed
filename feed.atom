        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I am currently an undergrad student, and I am thinking about switching to an available data science major at my school. I have a few questions about the qualifications, the job, and what is expected of me:
 1.) How much of an advantage will pursuing a Master's in Data Science get me if I opt to do it?
 2.) Does a PhD for Data Science (or another doctorate level degree) exist for Data Science? Again, is it worth pursuing?
 3.) If a PhD exists for Data Science, is it something Id do AFTER a Masters Degree, or something that would substitute a Masters, and Id do immediately after undergrad?
 4.) What are the daily expectations of a Data Scientist, and what are the overall work conditions?
 Thanks!

 I'm a CS guy doing a bachelor's degree paper exploring the use of emotion classification models to do temporal dimension analysis on a large corpus of collected non-English queer tweets under a social data science prof in a very conservative country. Thankfully, the advisor was more accommodating than the dean would have been...
 As a graduation requirement, I'm supposed to present it at an external academic conference, but I'm pessimistic about the quality of my paper (COVID and depression really messed me up and I am not a great scientist or a coder) and whether it'll pass or not, given that my current application is beint co-hosted by two fairly conservative universities from conservative countries. Might have to present next year if this application doesn't pass.
 Does anyone know any English-language academic conferences where this paper would be appropriate that I could attend (preferably remotely) at my sophomoric level? Tried doing some searches, but I am a fish out of water when it comes to social science and data science academia. Spent most of my uni years during lockdown, which still continues here.
 I'm moving next year, which further complicates things.
 Thanks in advance.

 I am in my 3rd year of my CS Major, and was investigating topics I might like to do for my thesis. My main interest so far has been software dev, but I am liking my machine learning class a lot so I’ve started to look into AI.
 I was planning on taking the intro to AI course my uni offers, but sadly it is taught by a professor I seriously dislike. I’ve had this prof before, and he is infamous in the faculty for being the kind of prof that ruins otherwise interesting courses.
 So my question was this: should I take the gamble with this prof for the university legitimacy or should I just study and learn on my own?

 In the past months, I got fascinated by the many programs that use AI for developing images, texts, and videos.
 I ended up testing most of them, not only for fun but also to help me in some business.
 I'm very excited about this AI trend, and I truly think it will disrupt many sectors.
 Recently, a friend and I got the idea of developing a hub to concentrate all these phenomenal tools:
 pandorasbox.ai
 We would appreciate your feedback on this first draft.
 Any suggestion of another amazing tools to include?
 What do you think of other kind of contents (like stocks companies/crypto) related to AI?
 What kind of problem did you get when trying to work/test/find AI software?
 Thank you all for your attention!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a boutique data science consultancy firm (that's relatively new) and my company would like to create a code base with example/starter scripts for various data science and data engineering tasks.
 These can include but are not limited to: pipelines for common ML/DL/NLP algorithms, functions to preprocess datasets, functions to upload data to or download data from buckets (GCP, AWS, Azure), etc.
 In essence, this will be a repository of the most common things a data scientist is likely to use in most projects.
 The idea behind it is that it is likely to improve productivity and create a stronger company culture (we're fully remote). Also, new hires always ask if we have something similar and are usually disappointed to find out that we don't.
 They would like me to lead this effort.
 I was wondering whether you have something similar in your company. If yes, do you have any tips as on how to approach this? What are some common pitfalls that can arise from such an effort? What tools do you use?

I could train the model on things like wickets, half centuries, sixes, fours etc. At the same time I know that we don't need ML models for EVERYTHING, and things like sports highlights are contextual, so automating it could maybe takeaway the appreciation of the match. I'm curious as what to what everyone else thinks of the idea.

He has told me that I have to develop a model for the bank. I have recently transitioned from non-data science background and this is my first chance to prove my worth. I plan on using classification to identify credit risk default. However, I have no idea where to begin. I have basic knowledge of statistics but I have no clue how to apply it in these cases. I would like your help as I don't want to fail in this project as this could lead to potentially a permanent job too. I am willing and eager to learn. I have about 3 months to learn and implement something.

I'm thinking that the project should be based on live data and if it can earn me some pocket money while I'm studying, nothing like it. 
 The dumbfuck approach i have is to upload a PvE mobile game but i don't think the ROI on that would be good, neither does it add much value to my resume. Maybe an app/program that buys and sells stocks? Not my preferred area but i could put in some research. 
 Do you guys have any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello DSs! 
 Thought I’d share this here and listen to different opinions. So I have/had a classification problem and of course I had tried most of the classification algorithms (from Random forest to AdaBoot, etc). I wanted to try XGBoost when I had the idea to treat it as a regression problem. So I fit the dataset with the binary classes using the XGB regressor. I then predicted the test set on it. Of course l, the output was continuous (i.e. 0.11, 0.2 etc). Of course, this can’t be passed into the classification evaluation metrics. 
 I then set a normal benchmark (<0.5:0, >=0.5:1). After running the evaluation metrics on the new result, I was surprised to see an accuracy of 0.83 and even high precision and recall for the unrepresented class. Has anyone else tried this? Do you guys think it’s rubbish?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trying to make this short;
  
went to university (physics) because I just didnt know what else to do (had no one I could ask)
 Graduated with a master's degree
 Worked for 2 years in semi-conductor industry
 Quit because of annoying boss
 Thinking about changing my direction into AI/Data Science
  
Working in the industry showed me I enjoy coding, data analysis etc., quite a bit more than I expected
 That got me thinking that I might use this pause between jobs to transition into this field. I have enough money saved up (frugal lifestyle) to finance myself for a couple of years. (I'm 29 y/o)
 I looked around and I could apply into a master's program "Artificial Intelligence" thanks to my Physics degree.
 But this scares me, as I have minimal coding skills which I only half-assed on the job, just to fulfill my task.
 What I'm asking here is that if someone here can relate in any way to have a look at my rough timeline and give me feedback on it.
 So my rough idea currently is something like this:
  
First year 
 Since I'm starting directly into a masters with minimal coding knowledge I will probably take less courses to make sure I can handle the workload and if necessary go back and re-study other topics I might lack
 
 Second year 
 Depending on how well the first year went, I might take extra courses or keep the workload intentionally low so I can deepen my knowledge in other fields I might deem important (statistics, linear algebra, etc.)
 
 Third year 
 Look for a part-time coding job to get hands on experience during my studies
 
 Fourth year 
 Look towards ending the studies and starting the thesis
 
 Fifth year 
 Finish the thesis, start to work somewhere

Their clairvoyance allows Tom Cruise and his "Precrime" police force to avert nearly all potential homicides.
 Twenty years on, in the real world, scientists and law enforcement agencies are using data mining and machine learning to mimic those psychics. Such "predictive policing", as it is called, is based on the fact that many crimes—and criminals—have detectable patterns.
 Predictive policing has enjoyed some successes. In a case study in the US, one police department was able to reduce gun incidents by 47% over the typically gun-happy New Year's Eve. Manchester police in the UK were similarly able to predi…]]></summary>

 I work in an agency in the data department as an Analyst, but I was hired to hopefully help the team manage/build ETLs using SQL, Python, and design and manage all ML solutions applied in-house. This includes some attribution analysis, some MMM, bayesian inference, applications of basic stats tests to marketing data (testing for winner of A/B tests, confidence intervals for CTR, projecting/predicting CTR using nonparametric models, etc). 
 A lot of it feels like support work that justifies another departments comings and goings, which I am fine with, but I have no idea if I am still a pure analyst anymore. I hear a lot of analysts do some ML work and Data engineering anyway. But if I am asked at review, what title is fair to tack on to my analyst role? Would I just be going for a snr. Data Analyst position? 
 I have been in marketing/analytics for around 5 years, but only 4 years as an analyst.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just chatted with a hiring manager and he basically used the meeting to get an understanding of my other job offers. When I told him of some of my offers, he dismissed those other organizations and kind of insinuated how those organizations won't be as respected by tech companies (a few of them were from govt). He also talked about all the benefits of the company but when I asked him whether there's a complete list of the terms and benefits, he said it's only available to see if I choose to accept the offer. So I can't even see the terms and benefits before I accept the offer? The most confusing part is how he said that he won't make me an offer until I'm 100% sure I'll choose his company as he doesn't want to waste time going through all the admin process for someone who won't definitely join. Isn't it his job to make the contract for me to review before I decide whether I'm joining? Rn I only have a brief overview of the terms, how do I decide whether I'm gonna join based on that??
 Edit: oh and I asked for a week or two to consider the verbal offer, but he said that the offer might be gone in two weeks. Is this normal?? I'm still waiting for other offers so I though 1-2 weeks would be normal to consider an offer. It feels like the hiring manager is threatening me to reply asap for his own KPIs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throwaway account.
 The company I work at is large and non-tech and they continuously grow their digital landscape. I can already see a lot of my time going into more fundamental data access questions e.g. accessing silos, lobbying for software or infrastructure. 
 The work is not necessarily hard-core data engineering (no heavy coding or setting up of servers) but there's a lot of making sure that the infrastructure and different intermediate data layers will be there in the future, to be implemented by other experts. Some form of ETL will definitely need to be organised.
 The company approach for data science is halfway sound from what I can see. Specific people have put quite some thought in what they want to achieve and parts of the data landscape are working well - while other parts are either in silos, haven't been anywhere near CRISP-DM or are still analogue. However, it just feels really small compared to the rest of the company. As a plus, the support of my department is there and people are fully behind the digitalisation effort.
 I've mainly been reading, learning and getting to know the business side which is great but I foresee see a two-year path ahead of just laying additional groundwork for enabling easy data access + analyses in the future. I'm not complaining. I know that I'm capable of doing this job, that it will be fun and that I'm extremely lucky to be in the position that I'm in. There's a lot to be learned. It's just not exactly what I expected and everything feels slow-paced and a bit lonely at the moment, to be honest.
 So, well, I just wanted to get some feedback from others in the non-tech DS space. Have you had similar experiences?
 Thanks.

 The new language model from Amazon is a multilingual large-scale model pre-trained on a set of denoising and Causal Language Modeling (CLM) tasks. As per the company, this strategy helps AlexaTM model to be more efficient for few-shot learning than the decoder-only language models. 
 ​
 AlexaTM 20B model achieves state-of-the-art performance om 1-shot summarisation tasks and outperforms larger PaLM decoder model with 540 billion parameters. Amazon’s model works particularly well for low-resource language pairs that it supports – Arabic, French, English, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu on Flores-101 dataset.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a rather simple project written in PHP, JavaScript, and some backend database code. Essentially, it uses the fantastic NewsAPI to automatically gather news headlines on a daily basis from about 50k different publishers, which include basically all the sources used by Google News. These headlines are then analyzed for syllable count and the site attempts to write haikus out of them. Only the most popular 5-7-5 syllable form of haikus are used, and unfortunately because the syllable counter is not perfect, the haikus generated do not always conform exactly to the syllable rules (but most of the time they do). The haikus themselves are generated on demand, so each time you refresh the page, you should see a new haiku. However, the data sources (news articles) only update once per day. The haiku is then fed into DeepAI's Stable Diffusion API to generate an image corresponding to the haiku. To keep things interesting, this image is either returned with no filter, a comic book filter, impressionist painting filter, or caricature filter. Note that the image takes around 20 seconds to load so it may take a moment to display. The image can essentially be thought of as a visual display of the generated haiku.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I just wanted to ask a question to those who have more experience here.
 When I got taught about hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV (and other SearchCV tools), the focus always was on maximising the score(s) chosen for the model at hand. However when I get test scores of 0.95 or over, I start getting nervous. Am I overfitting the data?
 Since GridSearchCV utilises cross validation and all the training is done with data separate from the one used to evaluate the model, I believe I am doing the right thing to prevent overfitting and poor model performance on unknown data, but a test score of over 0.95 on the test data still makes me a bit anxious. Or are my worries unfounded?
 Is there literature/expert advice stating what score ranges you should aim to train a model that can be deployed without too much worrying about overfitting the data?
 Thanks!
