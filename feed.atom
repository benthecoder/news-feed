 The dataset's rows are individual ordered products, which can repeat for a single customer depending on how many products they ordered in a single transaction/day (if they bought 10 dressers, a single customer has 10 rows, each row being 1 product bought). I'm tasked with gathering actionable insights for the client based on the dataset; the issue is that the dataset is very limited in terms of columns/variables, and I think/feel I'm out of ideas already.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you know that acquiring a new customer can be between 5x and 25x MORE expensive than retaining a customer?
 The effects of not focusing on customer churn prediction and prevention are particularly acute in industries such as telecommunications and banking. This could potentially result in the loss of recurring revenue and soft costs, such as your brand value diminishing from dissatisfied customers.
 PI.EXCHANGE is holding a webinar where we show you how you can use Machine Learning to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry with ZERO coding necessary.

 I was wondering if there are any free sentiment analysis tools that are pre-trained (on typical customer support quer), so that I can run some text through it to get a general idea of positivity negativity? It’s not a whole lot of text, maybe several thousand paragraphs.

Started actually building and testing models a bit over a month ago and now I'm fairly at a comfortable place. Not winning Kaggle competitions but the scores are something I'm happy with...for now.
 I've realised that my Achilles' Heel at this point is feature engineering, which is one of the most important tasks to build a good model. Before beginning work, I do look at similar datasets and see how others have treated that data but somehow my lack of knowledge in that domain fails me.
 I think I have very good interpretability skills from a business perspective but I'm unable to translate that understanding into features.
 How much time do you all spend researching the related industry/domain of the data before building models? Any tips/tricks that you think could work for me?

 ​
 I'm currently using an simple AutoRegressive model with the last N days to predit a sales outcome for the next day. I want to improve the model by using the first hours of the day that I'm trying to predict. 
 The problem is that the number of hours that I'll have available are note fixed. Maybe someone will use the prediction service at 8am and then at 4pm. How would you add this feature if you want to use all the data available at the time?

I program really well in R, but no one wants it, my Python is intermediate. I'm pretty good at stats from my PhD days, but that doesn't really come in handy in practice. When I do am ML project it's always regression based and seems to do the trick.... I did some deep learning courses, but I'm not sure if there are really any use cases out there for that... I basically feel like I'm not particularly well specialized. What thing could i really work on to start doing more exciting work and improve my job outlook? For example, really killing it with the deep learning is my first intuition, but it seems that in practice this skill is not all that sought after or needed.... What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of July 1st this year all health insurers in the US were required to publish files on their websites of all their negotiated prices they have for every possible medical procedure with every doctor in the country. In totality this data set equates to trillions of rows and hundreds of TB of data.
 I'm interested in building out a collaborative effort to aggregate all this data, but the cost of hosting seems to be a huge problem. What's the cheapest, effective way to host all this data in such a way that it's publicly accessible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm not a data scientist, but I've been assigned a project somewhat in this category and I'm trying to improve my programs performance.
 I'm scanning through a 10TB file system with 800,000 directories and a ton of files in python. I'm storing some file meta data like: size, mtime, and user id in a pandas dataframe, and it's taking 20+ hours to complete. What's odd about this is if I just go through the file system and only record file paths, it only takes about 6 hours. Which I would say is pretty fair. 
 I feel that my problem is a memory problem. The more data is store the slower the program gets. Im sure people in this field have to work through datasets this large or larger very frequently, and there are developed methods for doing so efficiently. 
 Is there a better means to record file meta data than to just save it in a structure in memory?

load data from csv
 encode data types
 normalize data
 .... more to come...
 split data into two
  
Is there a common Python design pattern approach for this type of pipeline data analysis?
 Not sure exactly what I need but it reminds me a little of a Builder pattern.
 var myObject = myBuilder.addName("John Doe").addAge(15).build() 
 I've seen some packages that look to support it using decorators, but not sure if that's overcomplicating things or even a common approach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been tasked with creating a production grade scalable distribution network routing optimization model with some additional nuances. I'm using Rust as it will use very large datasets and has many constraints. I presume using python computation will be very slow and can't take that risk. I'm quite adept in Rust FYI but didn't develop any AI/ML projects with it.
 Since I'm developing such a large scale project for the first time, I'm unsure as to how to arrive at a reasonable implementation timeframe since I may have to write the entire custom AI/ML model from scratch to accommodate for the uncommon nuances.
 Suggestions on how to make my work a bit easier from all of you experienced peeps are also welcome.

I like doing hands on work, the money is probably more than I need either way, but the management role fits what I actually do now, so I would be a good fit for either, in my opinion. I feel like it’s just kind of dumb to deny the reality that I would like either job and it’s a numbers game to me anyway because there are so many positions, but would this be sketchy, looks desperate? Is it unattractive to desperately want a job? I feel like I’d want to hire someone who did.

 I found a very interesting article - https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02655
 But there is no implementation for this. 
 Does anyone happen to find a ready to use implementation of this or similar algorithm?
