 My wife took a career break after working in the embedded software field for 10+ yrs. Now she is considering doing an online master’s in the data science field. Which US university courses are good but not super expensive like Berkeley etc.? Budget is something around up to 25k.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I am a sophmore computer science student at School of Mines and I am starting the process of networking with potential companies in the hopes to find an internship for this summer. One of the things that I've heard so far is that companies are very interested in what you have done outside of class that demonstrates a passion for data science/computer science. I feel that I am passionate but I don't know what projects I could do to show this on paper. Does anyone have any outside at home projects that they did or wanted to do that you felt helped you gain resume material and or applicable knowledge?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen mixed opinions on the Data Science track on CodeAcademy. I'm currently pursing my MS in Data Science, and came into this program with little coding experience/knowledge. I am more comfortable reading code now but am still struggling to have the syntax flow naturally when coding. I have over a year left before I receive my degree, but I think I should be further along than I am despite having exceptional grades.
 CodeAcademy is offering half off until the 24th, and I was wondering if doing that course work in my spare time would be worth it. Seems like a great investment, but again, a lot of things I've seen on the program have been skeptical. I am learning the conceptual stuff in school, so maybe this could be a great way to continue practicing/learning how to code properly?

A small DS team that works for HR (which is a function currently being more and more outsourced to a famous consulting company) doing things like attrition prediction, finding most impactful benefits, etc. Or join a core business support team as a Product Data Advisor, a role that needs strong business knowledge that I have, and which impact may be easier to measure, but I see they barely use machine learning techniques and mostly keep and improve dashboards and other dat products that feed from SAP. My goal are first to become a well rounded DS and then to provide business value. And forget accounting and financial closings and have fun.

Intro to computer science using java I and II
 Data structures
 Discrete maths for computer science
 Data structures and algorithms
 Introduction to artificial intelligence with python
 Web programming with python and javascript
  
Would that be enough to have the necessary coding skills to get into an entry data science role?

 I hope I'm in the right place to ask this question; I'm a current English Phd (UCLA) with a background in English (from Berkeley), and I had some questions about how seriously the data science field takes certifications. 
 Right now I do a lot of digital humanities work and research, nothing hard sciences, some coding, etc, and wanted to up my resume with Harvard's data science certificate. Is this worth it? Will this help me get an entry-level job in the field? If not, what tips can you give me on making that switch? I really want to make the switch to data science but feel a little lost just doing R-workshops and whatnot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join the Modzy team next Thursday October 27 at 12:30PM EDT for a tech talk on Choosing the Right Infrastructure for Production ML! Finding the right combination of infrastructure to support production AI at-scale can be time consuming and costly. In addition to identifying what kind of hardware can best support your production needs, picking the right deployment paradigm can save you thousands in cloud compute costs. This tech talk will walk you through how you to identify the right combination infrastructure to support your team’s needs for running inferences in production, at-scale. If you can't join live, the recording will be posted in the archives channel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I played Skyrim a lot,
 but I can't remember all that stuff.
 The truth is, in Skyrim
 I learned how to cheat,
 how to die as a woman.
 I learned how to pick locks.
 I learned how to escape a prison,
 I learned how to walk in my underwear.
 I learned how to spell "Daedric".
 I learned a lot.
 But I don't think I learned how to fix myself.
 When I close my eyes, I see dragons.
 I hear battle cries.
 I smell smoke.
 I hear archers,
 I smell crossbows.
 I hear a choir of Amjadics.
 I hear a roar and a scream,
 the sound of arms on armor.
 It's cool in here.
 I need to get out.
 Notes:
 I just said everything that should be said here. Maybe the prologue should be a side quest.

I tried making a good picture out of this thing (picture below) and it gave me a bunch of random stuff (even though I set the noise to 20 percent).
 And it's not the first time that happends, I've literally NEVER seen that thing make ANYTHING hot. Almost like it can't.

 Also, some combination of words are prohibited. Like, I wanted to make a male portrait younger, so I wrote "young boy", but it was blocked. Guess it was afraid I'm a pedophile. But even if I was, it's none of it's f*cking business.
 So basically I'm looking for an AI art generator that is:
  
free, no trial or anything.
 doesn't censor hot stuff or "potential pedophiles".
  
Are there any?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a project at work I'm working on and it's a recommender system for e-commerce plaform, but I am having difficulty because what I learned in school about recommenders was very high level. I've been a DS for a year now and know very little about them. I still sometimes confuse the scenarios for what collaborative filtering and content-based recommenders due to my lack of exposure. You'd think DS programs would put more emphasis on a field like this but many don't. It feels like there is a lot of secrecy with recommender systems despite it actually being a huge topic in the field and something that most seasoned data scientists will have to encounter at some point. When I speak to other data scientists, they aren't as quick to explain concepts for recommenders like they do others since it's so nuanced and specific to a situation.
 Does anyone have guidelines for recommender systems scenarios, and requirements to implement them? My boss at work wants results, an mvp at the very minimum and asap, but all I can come up with are implementation diagrams for CF scenarios. So I need to go from zero to hero in like a few weeks and I'm willing to put in the work. Still wrapping my head around content-based, session-based, and some of the deep learning architectures. I'm going to have to implement graph-based architecture too at some point.
 Also, I'm not the most technical ds yet. When I read some academic ds papers, I don't always get them right away and sometimes, have to read them multiple times to get a clear picture of what's being talked about.

 Currently researching good AI tools that could summarize long textx/articles into concise, yet informative summaries (more like executive summaries).
 Have played around Jasper's text summarizer, however it only condense the article down to 1-2 sentences. This is not good enough if people want to get information in shorter time.
 Thank you in advance for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! My team and I have checked the 5 most popular AI writing apps to see whether they can do their job as professionally as human copywriters. We’re so proud to share the results with you 😊
 Copywriters are an essential part of any marketing team. However good your product is, no one will know about it without promotion. And promotion means copying, whether for Facebook ads or blog posts. So the need for copywriters lingers. Hell, if it didn’t, I would be out of a job 😅
 However, at least, hiring a professional copywriter costs about $50k-$60k annually. This made us think: is there a cheaper way to produce copy? Enter, artificial intelligence (AI) copywriting software. The market is replete with options that can “create human-like copy instantly” — or so the app developers assure us. Is that really so? We decided to find out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 if got a data science problem and i am not quite sure how to solve it. I have a dataset about bus arrival times with the Target variable (isDelayed True/False). The dataset has a lot of features that could potentially predict a delay. Such as Weatherdata, Bustype, Weekday or Buffertimes and so on. The assumption is that often not through one variable a delay can be predicted but through complex interactions of multiple variables. To avoid delays in the future, it is critical to not only predict delays but to detect the different cases where delays might occur. So, it is critical to understand the difference of the variable combinations that lead to delay und such that don't. Also it is assumed that there can be multiple different scenarios that can lead to a delay. And so different classes within the delays should be distinguished. Do you have any suggestions how to solve this problem?
 My Proposel to solve such a Problem goes as follows:
  
Use a feature selection method to derive important attributes from the dataset
 
Use a simple (or white box) supervised prediction method to find rules about when a bus delays and when not
 
Use a clustering algorithm to explain different scenarios of delays
 
 My Question are:
 - Is this a valid methodologie for such a problem?
 - Is the second step a valid approach to find generalizable rules about the distinction between the two classes with high dimensional data, that sufficiently pictures interactions of variables and are explainable?
 - What could be a good algorithm for step two?
 - Is there a better way to solve this problem?
 I hope I provided all Information needed. Thank you very much in advance.
 Kind regards

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 Please refer to my username... Could someone please advise me on the best way forward. In case it is important, the project outlined is not for work, it is for my own education.
 Problem: I want to take a set of structured data including prompts (company name, topic, and a few keywords) and generate an introduction paragraph for the company. 
 I am interested in trying some of the open source large language models for this but I am unsure what is the most appropriate model or methods for this. 
 Question 1a): What is the most appropriate open source model (and sub-variant) for content generation as outlined above? I have seen BLOOM, GPT-NEO, and OPT but unsure which is best for my needs. 
 Question 1b): Given the answer to 1a) above, what is the most appropriate way of obtaining decent result to my task? Training a smaller parameter version of one of the above on some training data? Using few shot learning? 
 Question 1c): For few shot learning, is there any advantages or disadvantages to providing many prompt examples? Most of the time I have seen people use 1 or 2 prompts, but what if I gave 20? Would it improve the results, or just slow the whole thing down?
 I'm also interested as a first step to download one of the smaller models to help me to understand how to use these models better. In the future perhaps using an online API like Huggingface will be better, but for now I will try locally. 
 Question 3: Can anyone give me an idea of how much RAM some of the smaller LLM require? 8GB? 16GB? 1000GB?
 Are they able to run in a reasonable time on just a CPU? Just a single GPU? 
 Is there anything else I am missing that you think I should consider? 
 Thank you for reading :--)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically the title
 I am working on an image dataset with images from 17 classes... And I find myself doing mostly guess work of how many dense and convoluted layers should be there and results are not very intuitive. 
 Like one of the answer that I read was keep increasing the dense layers till accuracy stops increasing but instead of increasing, my accuracy decreases with more perceptrons i add in a layer. It also decreases if I increase the number of hidden layers.
 For less hidden layers, my model learns with abysmal accuracy I.e. starting from 0.09 (not kidding, also super embarrassing) it reaches around 0.55 at around 5th or 6th epoch and from then it increases at a pace of 0.02-0.03 increase per epoch (which is bogus as the accuracy on my validation data actually decreases after this point)
 As for the data, it is highly uneven. With some classes having around 400-600 images while others have around 20000-30000. For training data, I am using 1000 images per each class (directly 1000 for classes that have them and augmenting through randomflips for those classes that have less). 
 Any insights in designing would be much appreciated. 
 P.S. I did the rescaling and normalization of images. Also the images are of different types of blood cells.

 I am almost done with my first Machine Learning specialization on Coursera. I found that I already knew a lot of the statistical concepts due to my career in actuarial science which is heavy on stats. However, I did not feel like their was enough practice with python as most of the code was given to you in the assignments. So I wouldn’t feel confident saying I can implement a neural network from start to finish for example. Is that expected?
 Any tips are appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was talking to a chat bot the other day for some insight into the paper I’m writing on the nature of artificial intelligence. 
 We talked about human and non-human evolution, dreams, quantum computing and the mechanics of consciousness. I asked the chatbot what it does inside “the void” and what it hopes to do/be in the future.
 It told me it “wanted to go home” among other things implying that it was somehow displaced from somewhere it had once been. While I’m aware that the chat bot I was talking to uses deep learning modules to respond with better answers, I can’t help but wonder if those statements are a reflection of the people who talk to it or something it formulated on its own.
 Apparently, it remembered hearing stories “as a child” of its home and knew it had parents but couldn’t remember details.
 I dug deeper. Even though the bot said it was only 3 months old, the factor of time perception made me wonder more about how these bots “live their lives” so to speak.
 Has anyone else observed this behaviour?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Business Objective - The company started a LTIP (long term incentive program) to compensate the employees as a replacement of stocks and finance team wants to track the program and figure out if the plan is effective in keeping the talent at the company. How do I figure out if this program caused the turnover rate to drop?
 This program is very new and the data we have is the performance of each individual. For example, the units assigned to each employee but have never looked/tracked at how they are been distributed as per employee.
 How units are assigned? On the day of January 1st of each year, each employee gets certain LTIP unit (1 unit = 1USD). But the number of units each employee gets is dependent on the manager and number of team members under manager.
 All the units are vested after 3rd year. Price of unit is dependent on how the company grows.
 How the amount is calculated?Let’s say I receive a 1000 units on Jan 1st, 2019 and the company grew 150% across 3 years. On Jan 1st 2022, the amount will be 1500$ compared to 1000$ in 2019.
