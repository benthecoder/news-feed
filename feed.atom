        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a few years of analytics experience but have recently been looking to make a change. 
 Over the course of my career I've had many interviews. I've done many case studies (some live, some take homes). I've answered lots of various technical and behavioral questions. You know the drill.
 But not once had I been asked to literally calculate probabilities and shit live over an interview, until today. This seems like such bad practice to me. The question was a word problem, like something on a stats 101 homework assignment. There is quiet literally almost no value in asking questions like this.
 It seems like these questions aren't all that uncommon in interviews...but they definitely ought to be!
 How often have you been asked to do actual calculations during an interview?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello friends!
 I'm trying to build a book similarity model to evaluate how similar two books are. I have multiple text fields such as:
  
title
 author
 subject
 description (long text)
 table of content (long text)
  
Until now I was concatenating everything into one string and producing one TF-IDF vector for each book. Then I was simply running cosine similarity.
 Now I came to realize some features are more important than others. For example title similarity is more important than subject similarity, but I don't know how to incorporate that into the model. I was thinking of constructing a TF-IDF vector for each column and then calculating similarities separately, then weighting the similarity scores themselves. Is there a better way to achieve this?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to reverse engineer in my mind the process of returning summary statistics for a large dataset very quickly. I am thinking for example, returning data to a front end to create some charts on a webpage.
 Let's say we have a database recording the results of 20,000 matches of a game. The matches have all sorts of data, for example damage done by a certain spell every 10 seconds. It's a lot of data.
 We now want to return the total damage of the spell, "fireball", throughout all of the matches. A silly approach would be, every time a user visits a webpage, sum across all 20,000 matches find where spell = "fireball" and sum up each damage bit to get the total. This computation would take time regardless of overpaying for high levels of computational power.
 What I would consider doing in this case is create a new statistics portion of the database. It would include total damage for fireball. Each time you would finish a match, or at another time interval, you would simply add the damage to the total.
 When you want your statistics, you simply ping the fireball statistics and return the data. I think that this would work great because it would put minor computation requirements on your server frequently rather than massive computation whenever a user wants his stats.
 A problem comes up with this approach, what if you needed to report more complex statistics that you can't simply add to every time? If you wanted 95th quartile, or median, you would need to go through every game session and get yourself the entire series (let's call this a full database scan).
 My question: What sorts of approaches in data management are given for computing up to date complex statistics over large data sets? Would it be a batched process where we are not doing a full database scan every match, but perhaps every 500 matches? Is there any reading I can do to understand these types data/database management practices?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have what I think may be a simple request, but I don’t know where to start. I’d like to use a program to figure out how many unique groups I have by sorting two lists into a 3rd list. Let’s say list A has 100 locations, and list B has 20 products. All the items in list A require some of the products from list B. What I’m hoping to do is drag the items from List B over the items in List A thus creating a group, ie “item 1 in List A contains these 14 products” (and I need items in List B to be reusable across all the items in List A). Then I want the program to tell me how many locations in List A are receiving the same products (and which locations). Then afterwards I’ll know how many unique groupings of locations and products exist. I don’t know if card sorting would actually work here or if I have the wrong idea about what card sorting is. I’ve been able to do this in Excel somewhat successfully, but it’s more maintenance than help. Just hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there. I'm a university student who wants to learn data analytics and get a certificate online. I recently discovered 365 Data Science's free courses until November 21, and I was able to obtain coupon codes for a 60% discount on their annual subscription, which costs $174 per year.
 I'm interested in their Data Analyst career track. A total of 44 hours of course content plus exams is required for the certificate of completion.
 Is there anyone here who has used their learning platform? I'd be delighted to hear from some of you. I'd also like to hear from users of other platforms like DataQuest, DataCamp, and so on. I searched for the same question in this forum but only found spam promotional posts.
 I'm stuck between this course and the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. According to what I've read online, the Google one costs $39 per month and lasts 181 hours. Due to its lower cost and shorter duration, this makes me lean more toward the 365DS program.
 Which certification has more credibility and is more useful? I'm looking for a more job-ready option and something to help me overcome my poor academic performance. Thank you, any help would be greatly appreciated :)

I know stability was working on some thing, but I’m not really sure what it’s called so I haven’t really known what to look out for. I think I watched some kind of presentation where stability said that by the end of November they will have one of the text to music generators available on dream studio if I’m not mistaken? Would love to hear what you guys think!

I am familiar with the whole process so I am the only one who knows time-series since the other than a DS is on maternity leave.
 I asked for part time during my studies and full time but they didn’t give me anything and half assed any attempted to give me a job. However now that they are struggling they are asking for free consultations. 
 they put a new kid on the project but still do not have people qualified or knowledgeable enough to maintain and uphold the quality. So i am worried they would expect me to train their employees for free without them offering anything in return.
 Note: i put everything properly on documentation as well as how to trouble shoot potential problems.

Someone is sending me a huge data file across a subnet at 5MB per second. Often the job fails. I would like to try to fix this. How do I learn about this. I don’t even know what it’s called.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 ​
 Forgive me if this is not the right place to do this but I am studying data science myself and part of an assignment we have is to interview Data Scientist in the field regarding Data Ethics and create a summary of the results.
 ​
 Would a few of you mind answering the following questions for me? I have tried getting in contact directly with people at banks, other universities and so forth but I am struggling to find people willing to conduct the "Interview". We need to attach proof that we conducted the interview, hence I need actual real data and am not about the business of "fudging" results.
 Assignment questions are as follows:
 --------
 During the interview, discuss the person’s professional experience with ethics issues in their professional career on both the technical and personnel/workplace sides. This should include issues they directly experienced, and if they want, can include issues they heard about, as well. Pick two or three of the most memorable issues brought up by your interview, and ask some follow-up questions:
  
Do they feel the issue was handled well or not?
 Were there situations that made it difficult to take the most ethical path?
  
--------
 Any feedback would really be appreciated.
 Thanks :)

 I was thinking of doing an MDS to help train me how to work with big data. Would like to use the skills acquired to do bioinformatics or something related to analysis of healthcare data (I've been told by r/bioinformatics to go for an MDS instead of MSc Bioinf because you are taught similar skills but MDS will give broader job prospects). However, many of the MDS programs in my country are considered professional programs and thus funding is not provided by the university. This is a pretty significant downside for me. Would a masters in statistics provide me with similar skills? Thanks :)
