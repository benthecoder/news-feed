Also the anomaly has to be predicted in advance with respect to its occurring (i.e. predictive maintenance problem)
 Let’s say that both of the type of data (dynamic-time series and static-fixed) are strictly important because based on information in static variables there are different behaviors in the time series for the same channel.
 What state of the art approaches could be used to manage early anomaly detection on this kind of data?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've spent this entire month so far refactoring code that relies on dependencies that broke in the new year. The carnage ranges from our highest-level internal libraries, all the way down to the basic development infrastructure we rely on. I've even had to troubleshoot critical new bugs in Zoom, Outlook, and OneDrive.
 Is there any clever phrase to describe this phenomenon, where every coder on the planet chooses to push breaking changes at the turn of the year? And then every broken dependency fix creates a domino effect of dependency conflicts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: is 80k/90k too high an ask for a starting salary for an entry level position? 
 I have 2 years experience as an Electrical Engineer in a software, simulation, and analysis role. I have a EE bachelor's degree, with a minor in statistics. I am trying to make the switch to DS, because the analysis is my favorite part of my job. I live in a medium size city in the SE. I currently make around $80k. most of my coworkers who have quit in recent months are leaving for $90k+ easy. 
 I just got off the phone for with a preliminary interview for a small company. I asked for around 90k. They said that was too high. I said I wasn't willing to accept anything less than my current salary. They said 80k was also a bit high, given my level of experience. I feel like I've been bluffed, or maybe the interviewer is just out of touch with inflation trends. She asked to see my last 3 pay stubs as proof of my salary, to justify paying me such a "high" salary. 
 Is 80k high?? It would essentially be an entry level position, but I still feel like I'm bringing too much to the table, to not expect some bump in pay. 
 I'm tempted to continue on with the next rounds of interviews and accept the job, just to get my foot in the door. I'm not sure when I'd get a better opportunity.

 I received an official offer letter from company A over a week ago and today learned that another, company B, wants to make an offer, but probably won’t have it until next week.
 From the quoted figures, I believe company B won’t be able to match my current offer (they are also not yet public, whereas A), and I’m already tired of negotiating/interviewing.
 Is there a way to gracefully withdraw with company B? I told them I already got an offer and it’s a difficult decision. I just don’t want to wait anymore to secure a job given the market conditions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Digital Manufacturing (DM) refers to the on-going adoption of smarter, more agile manufacturing processes and cyber-physical systems. This includes modern techniques and technologies such as Additive Manufacturing (AM)/3D printing, as well as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and the broader trend toward Industry 4.0. However, this adoption is not without risks: with a growing complexity and connectivity, so too grows the cyber-physical attack surface. Here, malicious actors might seek to steal sensitive information or sabotage products or production lines, causing financial and reputational loss. Of particular concern are where such malicious attacks may enter the complex supply chains of DM systems as Trojans – malicious modifications that may trigger their payloads at later times or stages of the product lifecycle.
In this work, we thus present a comprehensive overview of the threats posed by Trojans in Digital Manufacturing. We cover both hardware and software Trojans which may exist in products or their production and supply lines. From this, we produce a novel taxonomy for classifying and analyzing these threats, and elaborate on how different side channels (e.g. visual, thermal, acoustic, power, and magnetic) may be used to either enhance the impact of a given Trojan or utilized as part of a defensive strategy. Other defenses are also presented – including hardware, web-, and software-related. To conclude, we discuss seven different case studies and elaborate how they fit into our taxonomy. Overall, this paper presents a detailed survey of the Trojan landscape for Digital Manufacturing: threats, defenses, and the importance of implementing secure practices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 We're developing an internal application that groups customers together based on attributes that adhere to a ruleset on how they should be grouped. It does this fine.
 However, some nuance is then applied via human effort to modify groupings based on some customer notes (a text string) that sometimes dictate that two customers need to be in different groups for x reason, even if the original grouping adheres to the ruleset. 
 The application itself has a UI that sorts customers into columns, which are manipulated by staff via dragging and dropping a customer/customers between one column and another. 
 I had a thought to employ an AI model that compares the original generated grouping config that our code produces against the modified groupings that staff adjust based on that nuance. The idea is that we could analyze the why of a modification and use that insight to generate better default groupings. 
 Is there a model out there that would be ideally suited for this kind of learning? Keen to dive into it further on my own but any recommendations as a starting point would be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm following 2 papers by Fader et al. for calculating LTV for a subscription based business. 
 I even found a post that breaks the method down in simpler terms. 
 https://towardsdatascience.com/customer-lifetime-value-in-a-discrete-time-contractual-setting-math-and-python-implementation-af3ef606cefe
 Following the paper found below, the author picks a single imaginary yearly cohort and uses that to calculate LTV. It all makes sense and I get it, but what I don't understand is how do we account for multiple cohorts using this method? Would we perform the calculation for each yearly cohort and take an average result for the LTV? Or randomly sample users from all cohorts and perform survival calculations based on this.
 Has anybody got experience using this method? If you could provide any insight it would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to build an optimal workspace set-up when working with code, specifically with machine learning models. So, what's your optimal workspace/workflow when integrating tools for building ML models? Please consider that:
 - I use my local machine for running and testing the data or ML models.
 - I use Python language.
 - I need to run the code several times (for testing).
 Currently, I'm using jupyter notebook (anaconda), but my ideal world is something like this:
 - I edit the code in Visual Studio code and I test the code running in Visual Studio (so I have the code output in VS itself). Once I find the code gives good results, I use Git to merge it, and push it to GitHub.
 - For those that could recommend just using a script, you have to consider running the whole code each time you want to test some small code block it's a big waste of time in machine learning, because you have to load and run all the data, preprocessing, ML, everything each time you run the whole script (that's why Jupyter Notebook are so commonly used among Data Scientist because it allows you to run a specific code block without having to run everything, even when Jupyter Notebooks are so labeled as tools for bad coding practices from expert programmers)
 I would appreciate it if you talk from your own experience :D !

 I am dealing with tens of thousands of pdfs and on my current system, reading all of them takes hours if not days. 
 I am wanting to get a desktop that can do the heavy computation and model building for me so that I am not doing all of this on my laptop. 
 For my use case, what kind of graphics card and processor should I get? 
 I plan to ask my work to build me this computer. I do not have a solid price range for it. Probably around $2 - 4 thousand would be fine.
 I can say for certain that it is more CPU intensive than GPU intensive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work as a data analyst and have a physics background, and to be honest I’ve always had a relatively pragmatic approach to statistical programming. I’ll write functions when it seems like I’m going to be doing something a lot, otherwise I won’t.
 In my work I’ll quite often start a new R script, or SQL script, and rather than write everything from scratch, I’ll typically copy and paste the code across from previous scripts - E.g. package loading in R, functions I use a lot, things like read_csv but just change the file path. Even though a lot of this is just lazy stuff that I probably know how to do, I feel like I don’t have the time to just write it all out from scratch again.
 Just wondering if anyone else does things like this?

 I am going to graduate in MSc Data Science in a month here in Italy and I've already finished my internship as a data scientist in a public institution that cannot hire me because there are no exams at the moment nor in the near future. I currently work as a teacher in Humanities but plan to switch my career definitively in September. Up until this date I want to keep learning things and applying what I know. I've already looked for intern on Linkedin but they are full time and not allowing remote job. I am considering to collaborate with startups or doing an intern for free, since my school contract doesn't allow me to be paid and now switching is impossible to me. 
 Working on my projects could be a solution, but I feel that I want to have feedbacks and dialogue with people with deeper understanding in this field. Plus, an intern or a collaboration are considered as more valuable in the CV. 
 Where can I find some startups or projects to practice my skills? Any suggestions is extremely valued. Thank you for your time!

The Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (MSAI) will be the first large-scale degree program of its kind and the only master’s degree program in AI from a top-ranked institution to be priced close to $10,000. The master’s degree covers about two years’ worth of course content, to be taken at the learner’s own pace, and master’s degree will be delivered in partnership with online course provider edX.
 AI master’s programs from peer institutions carry costs five to 10 times as high as UT Austin’s and serve only dozens of students — not the hundreds or thousands the Texas team projects it will reach annually within five years. Similarly priced online master’s programs from the university, in computer science and data science, enroll 2,500 students within less than five years of their launch. Like those programs, the fully online MSAI program is both flexible and accessible.
 Enrolled students will receive advanced training in natural language processing, reinforcement learning, computer vision, deep learning and related topics, and will provide a critical framework for understanding the ethical implications of AI technologies. The degree will equip students for an array of potential career opportunities — from engineering to research and development, and product management to consulting...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I got a job offer recently from a company. And I’m debating if I should take it or not. My job search has been pretty dry so far. I just graduated school with a bachelor’s in data science last month, and have been applying since august. While I’ve gotten a few interviews here and there this was my first offer. The company seems a bit weird. I think they are basically a consulting company that provides data analyst for other companies. They end up putting you through a bootcamp for a two months which you do get paid. However, most of the training curriculum is what I already learned from my degree. After that you are relocated somewhere random in the US. While the salary is on the lower end I’d still be happy to accept the role for experience. But not sure if I’d be willing to go somewhere random with no say. 
 While I’m thankful for getting an offer, and I know the job market is pretty bad rn. I wanted to know if I’d be a fool to wait for something else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What happened? So, there has been a lot of excitement around OpenAI's ChatGPT which generates natural-language responses to human prompts.
 But what if... it's not as amazing as we all think it is?
 Yann LeCun, Meta's chief AI scientist, argues that the program is not innovative. He also states that similar technology has been developed by many companies and research labs, and that ChatGPT is composed of multiple pieces of technology developed over many years by many parties.
 (sounds salty to me... and I like my cookies sweet!)
 But maybe Yann has a point!
 What's happening now? ChatGPT is perceived by many as a unique and innovative program. People are using it everyday to make their lives easier. So, no matter what, ChatGPT is still awesome.
 What's happening next? It's unclear what will happen next in terms of the development and perception of ChatGPT. However, it can be expected that as AI technology continues to evolve, there will be further advancements on what is possible with this tech.
 It's likely that ChatGPT will face many spin-offs and competitors this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN! Some more info: I’m an NHS doctor and the founder of Pi-A (https://www.pi-a.io) which developed Lungy (https://www.lungy.app). Lungy is an app (iOS only for now) that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It hopefully has many aspects of interest to the HN community – real-time fluid, cloth and soft body sims running on the phone’s GPU.
My background is as a junior surgical trainee and I started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London. During COVID, there were huge numbers of patients coming off ventilators and they are often given breathing exercises on a worksheet and disposable plastic devices called incentive spirometers to encourage deep breathing. This is intended to prevent chest infections and strengthen breathing muscles that have weakened. I noticed often the incentive spirometer would sit by the bedside, whilst the patient would be on their phone – this was the spark that lead to Lungy!
The visuals are mostly built using Metal, with one or two using SpriteKit. There are 20 to choose from, including boids, cloth sims, fluid sims, a hacky DLA implementation, rigid body + soft body sims. The audio uses AudioKit with a polyphonic synth and a sequencer plays generated notes from a chosen scale (you can mess around with the sequencer and synth in Settings/Create Music).
There are obviously lots of breathing and meditation apps out there, I wanted Lungy to be different - it's about tuning into your surroundings and noticing the world around you, so all the visuals are nature-inspired or have some reference to the physical world. I didn’t like other apps required large downloads and/or a wifi connection, so Lungy’s download size is very small (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34534615

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not a data scientist, so please bear with me.
 I have a data set of items that are assigned tags, and I want to group them by the similarity of the sets of assigned tags. Below is the context:
 - Each of these items can be assigned many different tags (between 100 and 300). 
 - The universe of possible tags is approximately 2500
 - Only 1000-1500 are used consistently.
 What would be the most efficient and/or accurate way to cluster items such that those with the most similar sets of tags are grouped together? I would imagine that - to start - I would need to represent the data like below:
  Tag1 Tag2 Tag3 Tag4 Tag5 Tag6 Item1 0 1 1 0 0 0 Item2 1 0 1 0 1 0 Item3 0 0 1 0 0 1 ... 
 Is this the correct start? Once I've represented the data this way, what would I do next?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been an intensive care doctor for 10 years now and I’m looking at making the jump to a career in medical AI. Currently in Australia 
 A few questions : 1. I love my clinical job, but there is a strong possibility that a lot of clinicians will be replaced by AI. I would want to be at the forefront of this. I don’t see myself working in a hospital till I die. Plus this is very very exciting!! What do I as a clinician bring to this? Is there even a job opportunity for doctors in this field? Part of me is like “what am I even doing thinking of AI? I don’t belong here”
  
I did a basic Coursera course on AI a few months ago, but that was just dipping my toes. How do I start studying this? I have no background in software/ coding, just a very good work ethic and an above average intelligence. Who do I talk to? I obviously need mentors bcos this is completely unfamiliar territory to me.
  
Any advice will be useful

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been seeing a lot lately that people on Twitter are saying that Monte Carlo Simulation is overlooked in Data Science courses and I want to know why is it important. 
 What topics in Monte Carlo Simulation are useful for Data Science? Where are these used? Do you have any resources for a use of it in practice? 
 I barely know the difference between Bootstrap and Monte Carlo. And the only time I've used MC is in Neural Network dropout, to measure the uncertainty of my predictions.
