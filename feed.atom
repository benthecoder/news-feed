        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN!
I just shipped a project I’ve been working on called Maroofy: https://maroofy.com
You can search for any song, and it’ll use the song’s audio to find other similar-sounding music.
Demo: https://twitter.com/subby_tech/status/1621293770779287554
How does it work?
I’ve indexed ~120M+ songs from the iTunes catalog with a custom AI audio model that I built for understanding music.
My model analyzes raw music audio as input and produces embedding vectors as output.
I then store the embedding vectors for all songs into a vector database, and use semantic search to find similar music!
Here are some examples you can try:
Fetish (Selena Gomez feat. Gucci Mane) — https://maroofy.com/songs/1563859943 
The Medallion Calls (Pirates of the Caribbean) — https://maroofy.com/songs/1440649752
Hope you like it, and would love to hear any questions/feedback/comments! :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(long read)
 Greetings all
 I am an international graduate based in the UK, and recently completed my Master's degree in Bioinformatics and Data Science in Health last autumn. I have recently returned from a trip to my home country and am now seeking employment.
 My programme primarily leads to two paths, either research or working as a data scientist for a health-related company, but neither of these options appeal to me. Throughout my course, I developed a fondness for coding in R and Python and enjoyed solving software-related problems, learning new libraries, reading their documentation, and fixing bugs and so on. I don't have any interest in solving statistics related problems, though.
 I am struggling to determine how to break into a more engineering-focused position without prior job experience. Should I initially apply for analyst roles and work towards transferring to data engineering? I am somewhat pressed for time, as I have only two years left on my graduate visa and am feeling quite confused. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a dataset full of Twitter tweets, with a column for the text of the tweet. For each tweet, one word has been selected as a keyword and each such word is in another column called "keyword." '
 For my purposes, these keywords serve as a label.
 My goal is to create a model to label a Tweet, but I'm having trouble deciding how to encode the label so that I can properly label the Tweets.
 My vocabulary size is 41,886 words, so figure the number of bits for one-hot encoding is 41,886. My training set has 5709 rows and my test set 1904 rows, so 7613 rows in all, so if I try to one-hot encode the keywords, figure roughly 319 million elements in the resulting one-hot encoding array.
 Using word2vec would be problematic, I think, because you can't classify vectors without running the risk of floating-point-related errors.
 What's the most optimal encoding specifically for this purpose?

 I’ve seen a lot of ads around my school for a Data Science MS program where they encourage anyone to apply, but it looks like it’s very computer science and statistics-heavy. 
 Which I wouldn’t mind but I have no basic skills compared to a lot of the people coming in from math or computer science backgrounds. 
 Is it worth it to try to pursue this program or would I be starting way behind everyone? Would I even be able to take the advanced computer science classes required, since I didn’t take much CS in my bachelors??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The traditional route to data science seems to be at least a Masters in Maths > DS > ML etc.
 This is obviously a good start and will hopefully instil good DS foundations - in terms of the theory and tech skills (Python/R etc).
 One key ingredient that is missing is an emphasis on pro-activity. You go through school being told exactly what to do. You go to uni, again being told what to do. And then you get an entry level DS job and they tell you what to do.
 An important skill to develop is being able to asses the tools and materials available to you and come up with something that adds value all on your own. E.g. if you are a data anaylst or DE? well you have access to a shit load of data. Say your company has commercial interests i.e. they want more sales etc. Can you use some advanced analysis to either review customer behaviour or potentially create a model to predict sales?

I recently got really interested in AI and especially AI's that are able to learn how to play a specific game. You may or may not know Vedal987 but I am taking huge inspiration from him on how his AI "Neuro-sama" is able to play osu! 
 I want to do something similar with the same game but, I really am a beginner with AI's of that kind so I wanted to ask if you have any learning materials for me or guides on how to start and all the stuff that I could need to actually execute my plan (and if it even is possible within a year) 
 I am an expert in Python (also good in Java and Javascript), I can code and stuff but have no clue how to start out since I've never done this. 
 Thanks in advance :) 
 (feel free to ask me if you dont understand something, i am bad in expressing myself)

I don’t do coding interviews: I trust you know how to code, if you really want to be in this field you’ll learn tools and languages on your own.
 
I don’t do case study: I don’t really have the time for this, I want my “technical interviews” to be 15-30 mins.
 
I want to know if you understand the basics of math/stats and if you can reason through unknowns. I want to see how you process through problems.
 
 Lately I’ve been getting candidates who make it to my round and when I ask them some basic concepts, they completely flunk it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently a graduating senior at Boston College with double major in CS and Math. Got a SWE job offer at a big fund company. 
 I basically leetcoded my way into a job. No research experience, no personal projects. But I've always found my statistics classes most interesting, which piqued my interest into DS since I already knew how to code. After taking some data science-y electives, I wish I had gotten into DS sooner instead of SWE. 
 From what I understand, getting into DS is not something you can leetcode your way through. You either need a PhD or a mind-blowing side project. 
 Graduate school is out of the question (for now, unless I find a company-funded program), as I have to start making money asap. I was thinking I stay in SWE for a couple years and try my luck with DS on for my third or fourth job. 
 How does one move laterally into DS from SWE without a grad degree or any research experience? Is pivoting into SWE from DS common, or will it be too late for me to transition then? 
 Some stat-related course work I've taken:
  
Probability (Discrete and Continuous)
 Mathematical Statistics
 Advanced Data Analysis (regressions, ANOVA, non-neural learning methods)
 Natural Language Processing

While I was quite proficient with doing analytics with excel when I'd just download a bunch of data, now that things are embracing single-source-of-truth, automation and cloud-based approaches, doing basic manual things has gotten a lot harder, even with desktop excel. I've learned a lot of new stuff, but some key things are eluding me. If I was doing a big enterprise-scale, future-forward solution, I actually feel like I could move forward well, but trying to utilize these tools in my personal life has been hard.
 To start my current use case of personal finances (and its only step one of getting a good personal finance dashboard), I need to merge, categorize, and i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Building some context. I have an MIS degree. Worked as a data analyst at two different companies, adding up to 3 years. Just completing my first year as a Software Engineer focused on a Data pipeline features. I am very comfortable with Python, object oriented programming and even have a few DS projects on my resume. 
 The last couple of years have been miserable for me and I'm mentally exhausted.
 I'm looking for a way to get out of my current job. It isn't the best place to be for a variety of reasons. Been interviewing for DE, Analytics Engineer roles for a couple of months, but haven't gotten too far. DS has been a field of interest for me but I never got any calls because of lack of relevant experience. 
  
With some experience as a SWE, do I have better odds getting hired as a DS/MLE?
 
How do I approach the job applications? Please suggest any projects/skills that will get my resume some traction for these roles? 
 
 I'm feeling severely hopeless, please be kind. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just joined a software company's support operations team as a data scientist. My first project is to improve the current forecasting model predicting future support case volume over the next 12 months to be used as an input for capacity planning.
 The company has multiple software products and the current forecasting models that have been used are all just univariate forecast models that have been only trained on using the historical case volume for each product. These models in general perform pretty well in terms of forecasting accuracy, but the business stakeholders are complaining about how "un-explainable" these forecast values are. They want to break down each forecast values into multiple components, but the current model class won't allow them to do so because the these forecasts are only derived from analyzing the past volume's seasonality, holiday effects, and running trends (either increasing or decreasing year over year).
 When I chat with my business stakeholders, they said that the case volume is driven by factors such as active customer count/distribution of customer size across different regions, product maturity measure, case deflection rate (how self-serviceable the company's Knowledge articles and navigations are), and others. We do have these drivers and the stakeholders want to use them and their expectations of the future trends for these drivers in the upcoming forecasts.
 Looks like I can try multivariate models such as VAR, VMA, VARMA, or VARMAX. However, I'm not really sure how reliable they would be. If they won't result in something that will be adopted, then I would prioritize improving the current model's accuracy.
 So my question is, have you also run into the similar problem? Are multivariate forecasts actually even used in Capacity planning? Which model class can I look into?

 I'm a student that is taking part in a contest focusing on banned works of art, and the relationship between art and society. After trying my hand at Chat GPT and DALLE2 I've spurred an idea for the topic of this contest. 
 A couple details, the contest is in the form of a comic book page, it's surrounding the themes of obscenity, libel, codes, copyrights, etc. I was considering using AI as the subject matter considering the recent controversies surrounding this new technology. Questions such as whose art is it? The person using the technology, or the person owning it? Is it copyrightable considering it's fed data based on previous artists work? I'm relatively new to this space other than witnessing peoples uses on various social media. 
 So given that, my idea was to have Chat GPT generate a fictional story surrounding the relationship of society and art, tweaking until I have something that can be applied into a comic book form, then feeding parameters into DALLE2 to create comic book panels. Given the controversial nature of utilizing AI for school related essays, homework, etc I was curious what this community thinks of this idea? I felt like it was one two punch, utilizing new technology to create artwork that's relevant to the topic at hand and also has the potential to be "banned" so to speak from participating in the contest.

 long story short, the output from the many complex sql queries that have been being ran is most likely inaccurate and then the analysis done on it is independently shit. took me many many hours to figure this out and i’m exhausted. i blew the whistle today because the deliverable goes out to major clients. my complaint is being taken seriously but still wtf 
 how can so many people be complicit in this?
 edit grammar
 for context: i can write complex sql queries and know my way around R but I don’t know complex stats,math, logic etc that goes into building ML, Ai etc models. Idky this is being downvoted so hard. know am young and probably wearing too heavily coated rose colored glasses, but i think this is a valid question to the sub :/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I am doing workforce planning for a business center, but I am stumped.
 In my workplace, in 2022, a total of 102 cases (i.e. work that needs to be done for this workplace) arrived, on average 1 case every 3.5 days. The response time for these jobs is given as approximately 30 days. The jobs received are solved in an average of 14 days.
 The problem is that with Erlang C I cannot find out how many staff I need in this scenario.
 The other problem is that my manager wants answers to the questions "How many staff will we need if it will be answered in 15 days, how many staff will we need if it will be answered in 60 days, how many staff will we need if it will be answered in 90 days?".
 In other words, he is asking me how many staff I will need for each of the cases to be answered in 15-30-60-90 days respectively. I tried to do it with Python & Erlang C but I couldn't solve it. I am sharing with you both the code I wrote and a section from the excel file.
 Please tell me what I am doing wrong and how I can fix it.

 I am currently attending a Data Science course and to finish I have to write a paper about a project that I am currently working on. I write the code in VSCode and I use .ipynb notebooks.
 So I am basically training a few ML models after a long data preprocessing which worked out fine. But as soon as I run my hyperparameter tuning code, my PC takes a lot of time. Right now I am running hyperparameter tuning for RandomForest and it already runs for 21 hours.
 Is there any possibility for me to run my code somewhere else? I read abour Heroku, but that seems to be too much than what I am looking for. I am getting a bit nervous, because I want to get this paper done. The worst case is that I have to buy a new PC.
 Thank you so much!

 I want something less stressful. I’ve applied to dozens of places in ML engineer, data scientist and data analyst roles and have not heard back from any. I have a BS in linguistics and an MS in data science. 
 Does anyone here work as a data librarian? Wondering if you would need a MS in library science. Maybe being a librarian in general would be less stressful…

The first things I tried worked like a charm and got everything I was asked to do (a simple logistic regression was really effective). Is it better to just leave at that EDA + some manipulation and the first model I've tried already worked great, or is it better to add some other models and techniques so I show off/compare a little bit? What skill they are trying to evaluate other than the code/model working? and how much should I explain without being pedantic? I'm tend to be too perfectionist (legacy of my uni, where they ask for scientific level documentation pretty much always) 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artists have always benefited from other people's work. Instead of figuring everything out on your own, you can build on the work of past artists, critics, theorists, etc. to help you figure out techniques, tricks, perspectives. Then there is technological assistance. Digital art is in many ways easier than painting/drawing on a canvas or paper, because it allows you to erase, copy, flip, magnify, etc.
 I think AI could become an even more accessible version of this sort of assistance.
 Imagine if you had complete control over a number of variables when creating an image. You would choose what to depict, the dimensions and position, the lighting, the colours, but you wouldn't need to study human anatomy or architectural styles, or how light casts shadows and refracts in water. The AI could calculate or source these things for you.
 This way AI could allow anyone to create any picture they wanted (as long as they could think of it).
 Do you think this is possible? Would it be very bad for artists? Or would it create new kinds of art and artists? Would you want something like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To clarify, I'm not talking about ChatGPT here. I've been testing outputs from GPT-3 davinci003 against alternatives in terms of output quality, relevance, and ability to understand "instruct" (versus vanilla autocompletion).
 I tried these: AI21 Jurassic 178B NeoX 20B GPT J 6B FairSeq 13B
 As well as: GPT-3 davinci002 GPT-3 davinci001
 Of course, I didn't expect the smaller models to be on par with GPT-3, but I was surprised at how much better GPT3 davinci 003 performed compared to AI21's 178B model. AI21's Jurassic 178B seems to be comparable to GPT3 davinci 001.
 Does this mean that only well-funded corporations will be able to train general-purpose LLMs? It seems that just having a large model doesn't do much, it's also about several iterations of training and feedback. How are open source alternatives going to be able to compete?
 (I'm not in the ML or CS field, just an amateur who enjoys using these models)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For each working day, I have 6-7 meetings and almost have no time to do data analysis. Do you know if this is normal? If you are a data analyst, could I take you a couple of minutes to the questions below? Thanks in advance!
  
Ratio of daily meeting VS daily data analysis, like 2:8,3:7, etc. How many meetings do you have each workday on average?
 
Is there a data manager that can advise/lead you? Or you need to report to the manager with no data background.
 
Required skills you need in your data analyst job. Technical skills VS communication skills, which is a little more critical for you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My dream is data science, but unfortunately my dream in high school was to get stoned and watch YouTube videos all day. I totally blew my chances of university (I am 24 now), but I currently have a 2 year diploma in software development and will soon be doing a 14 month post-diploma certificate in Data-analytics. 
 If I work as a Python developer for a couple years and eventually transition to Data analytics, will there be any chance of me transitioning to data science if I also have a solid portfolio? I guess what I am really asking is did 17 year old me really ruin any chance I had at pursing this goal of mine?

 Here is what I think will happen:
 Most websites will die out.
 Why?You don't need 10000 recipe websites.You need culinary Wikipedia.And a chatbot to query it.99% percent of recipes are not unique.Culinary theory is pretty established.They can be condensed into branching stricture.e.g. Pasta with tomatoes.Pasta with cheese.
 Plumbing.Pretty much the same.
 Programming.All you need is documentation pretty much.You can even analyse open source projects and generate documentation on the fly.Tutorials and best practices can be condensed.
 News.I was thinking about extracting news from data collected from ambient computing.E.g. Google develops new feature.News article is generated from Todo lists,meeting notes,code.But it's too far out for now.
 And list goes on and on.
 You need 100 Wikipedia to contain all human knowledge.And even if websites will refuse to cooperate it doesn't matter.There is plenty of copies of the web.
