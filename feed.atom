I know there are some developments that can help people see, but I&#39;m not too sure of anything that can potentially help them when they are using a bank. Please let me know what types of things AI can do!

 Hopefully this DOGE implosion proves it&#39;s horrible to use and you don&#39;t actually own anything you buy off of their shitty app. It will crash every time something massive happens.
 Use a hardware wallet in the future so you actually control your crypto.
 Trezor and Ledger are amazing hardware wallets and there are many other hot software wallets online to use too.

[Epistemic status: my current view, but I haven’t read all the stuff on this topic even in the LessWrong community, let alone more broadly.]
There is a line of thought that says that advanced AI will tend to be ‘goal-directed’—that is, consistently doing whatever makes certain favored outcomes more likely—and that this is to do with the ‘coherence arguments’. Rohin Shah, and probably others1, have argued against this. I want to argue against them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like most American high school students, I was required to take Chemistry and English. Chemistry thrilled only by way of the absurdity of allowing kids like me to play with volatile compounds and an open flame. English provided little of that thrill save, perhaps, Holden Caulfield’s excessive swearing or Huckleberry Finn’s audacity in heading down the big river after faking his own death.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It might surprise you to find out how little evidence there is to support the idea that boosting students’ “grit”—their propensity to tenaciously attack difficult problems they encounter rather than give up—is a reliably effective way to improve their school performance or to close long-standing education gaps. After all, you’ve probably heard otherwise. Grit is everywhere. By the time you read this, it will have been a golden child of the world of education for well over a decade.

Most problems can be separated pretty cleanly into two categories: things we basically understand, and things we basically don’t understand. Some things we basically understand: building bridges and skyscrapers, treating and preventing infections, satellites and GPS, cars and ships, oil wells and gas pipelines and power plants, cell networks and databases and websites. Some things we basically don’t understand: building fusion power plants, treating and preventing c…]]></summary>
