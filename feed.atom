 I would like to know how to reward DAOs not on a task basis, but by calculating their contribution through data analysis.
 If we can create that method with high quality, I believe we can create a new system of economy that will be upward compatible with capitalism.
 We call it freeism. 
 About freeism
 We came up with the "freeism" system as an alternative economic mechanism to capitalism.

 As a meager software engineer mortal, I've always been curious about how concepts/algorithms work in machine learning. I am starting a series of posts, documenting my understanding of these concepts.
 Here's my first attempt; it's on Gini impurity, a core concept fundamental in how decision trees are built.

That's great and all but I'd like to move the spotlight to the rest of us for just a minute. Cheers to my fellow mediocre data scientists who don't work at FAANG companies, aren't pursing a PhD, don't publish papers, haven't won Kaggle competitions, and don't spend every waking hour improving their portfolio. Even though we're nothing special, we still deserve some appreciation every once in a while.

So here’s America, composed of several APIs that paint a vivid, real-time picture of a good old-fashioned road trip. Get local classifieds and photos. Tune into local radio stations. Talk wit other drivers.  And more.
Exploring the country by car was an invaluable experience for me during my time in the states. I’ve since moved to Barcelona, and find myself missing the territory. This is my attempt at recreating the magic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand that you need to do Power analysis in order to figure out what sample size you need for your AB test, but something that I have difficulty coming up with is “what MDE should we use?” Researching online hasn’t been much help because all I see are examples of where they just give an MDE to use but don’t explain the process of getting there. 
 For my company, a lot of our tests have very low operational costs, so in almost all cases any positive performance is worth rolling out. Basically, even if we saw only a 0.05% lift, if it was statistically significant, we’d probably implement the change. This has led me down a path where I basically just check to see what MDE we can reasonably detect given the number of users coming into the platform INSTEAD of determining what MDE is actually valuable. I feel like this is the wrong approach, but I’m unsure what else to do given that our “goal” MDE is basically anything above 0. This especially makes it difficult for me to determine when I should stop the tests as well, other than picking a somewhat arbitrary end point of 3-4 weeks and then seeing if there is any directional value from the data. 
 What would you do in this situation? How do you determine the MDE for your AB tests? 
 Thanks!

 My question requires some introduction, since I know how feed-forward neural networks, and also convolutional neural networks do work mathematically and practically. In this post I do only want to talk about CNN's which are used to learn images
 I know that CNN's (convolutional neural networks) do consist of a few layers which proccess an image in the first part, being followed by one ore more fully connected layers, which indeed act like a classical feed-forward neural network.
 So in the first part of a CNN, there are one or more stacks of a convolutional layer being followed by a pooling layer. After 1 or more repetitions of a convolutional layer together with a pooling layer, the first part ends with a flatten operation, which does now transform t…]]></summary>

The path I want to take is Master-Thesis --> PhD --> Industry. There are many pros and cons for me to take any of these two. I'm here because I doubt the demand of the industry on additional experts in Bayesian-ML for Control Engineering. The doubts originate from the following reason.
 People are working on Bayesian methods since decades and engineering also does respectively. So it might be, that experts from these decades are already spread through the industry.
 NLP in comparison is pretty new and on high demand without a doubt.
 Does someone has insights for me on the demand of the industry on Bayesian-ML in Control Engineering? More specifically I could also ask, if Kalman Filters and Gaussian Processes are of interest?
 ​
 I'm thanking every reader for his/her/<other pronouns> attention and even more for answers :)
 Links to informative threads are also appreciated (I only found average useful ones)!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Long history short: the analytics director of my non-tech company, who is a DS illiterate, has hired a Data Science Lead that has considerably fewer qualifications, and just 2 years more work experience than me (senior DS). In our first interaction, he bragged about how he created a segmentation model using a random forest with an accuracy of 94% in his previous role ...
 I was previously leading our team of 3 DS and 2 DE. It is quite blurred how we will collaborate and divide the roles, management responsibilities, and workload.
 It is still early days, but I wanted to get insights and advice from the community, from people who have been in a similar situation. I've done a few google searches on this topic and haven't found anything. Maybe everyone out there has competent and knowledgeable data science leads/managers? It could be the case, as I guess you can't fake being a data science lead and get away with it, can you?
  
How do senior data scientists learn and are mentored by lead data scientists in your organizations? Is there a way to check informally if this guy has knowledge/skills that I can really pick up and learn from him?
 Should I transfer to him all my management responsibilities and the projects I own?
 Any advice about how to cope with this situation, especially during his first 100 days would be gold. I guess working patterns and assumptions that solidify at the beginning will stay there. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am wondering about about some recent trends I have been experienced at work with younger or less experienced data scientists.
 People are fitting these large multivariate, nonlinear models that come directly from python libraries, for example PyOD outlier detection. They just compare results from all the built in ML algos. They don't think about any simple methods what so ever for detecting outliers. However, the end user always drills down to univariate to see if the features are significant anyway. So I don't see the purpose in testing the advanced algos without a baseline.
 So instead of starting with a basic statistical outlier method, or univariate or linear method,like PCA, all of this is skipped and considered irrelevant or "dinosaur". 
 My argument is that if you don't have a baseline simple method, you will never understand the benefit the ML algo brings . Basically if they cant can't find a benefit over univariate , they shouldn't promote the advanced methods yet.
 What are your thoughts on this?
 How do I convince these people to slow down and take baby steps to see the benefits without insulting them? 
 How do I stop ignorant management from listening to these trendy individuals? Its quite frustrating when a simple method beats a complex desired method, but someone won't listen because they want to look smart.

 So, I'm currently running some regressions and similar, in order to create a trading algorithm. I've collected and cleaned daily price data for each currency pair, and I have organised relevant variables. I'm looking to build an algorithm in order to best determine future price changes, based on a few variable. Some are dummy, some are percentage values. 
 I've ran simple OLS regressions to see I have a strong and statistically significant (at 0.001% level) between my dummy and price data, although I'm struggling to work out how to incorporate more variables into this. I also don't think OLS is the best way to do this, should I be using MA(?) Or EMA(?)? I've done an economics degree with econometrics moudles so I know a bit about what I'm doing, although not enough to do what I want to. (clearly 😂!)
 Any advice would be massively appreciated! I'm currency learning to use python, would NumPy or similar be satisfactory? 
 Thanks again!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago I started a data science focused blog. I’ve posted a few tutorials but I’ve mostly posted data stories about things that interest me. I try to make an interactive element that is usually a small web app that lets you interact with the data. I’ve had some moderate success with about 10 thousand unique visitors in September. 
 My question is, do y’all care about these data stories? I would prefer to make things people want, and I’m not sure I’m doing that. A few ideas I had that y’all might like:
  
Live streams of doing data science projects. Scraping, cleaning, and modeling in one chunk of time. 
 Technical posts. Do a project and walk through the code. Basically blog post with code. Not a tutorial exactly though. 
 Mini data products with all code attached to remake/remix yourself. 
  
I’m open to ideas. So, what kind of content would you like more of?
 The blog is datafantic.com. My goal here is not to get clicks but to understand y’all better. My target audience is other data scientists, and I would like to create content y’all like.

 Up until now I have extensively worked on computer vision problems for the past 3-4 years but did not get a lot of opportunity to work on NLP problems. Therefore, I want to get an overview of the current research status and its applications in the NLP domain. Can anyone suggest some good papers to read in the NLP domain to get a brief of the current research status there?
 Thanks a lot!

yeah, with being rumored to be selling in two years when it's available, this is a period of downsizing to be swallowed by another owner. I've come to accept that. Cartoon Network is what I grew up on, but it's alright if kids today grow up on other animation studios. Or even more realistically the direction things are headed, animation studios probably won't be a thing. Digital art is going displace a lot of the work in the space. An artist can create a style for a series and AI will be able to replicate it. Although I think we need to also stop considering animation for kids,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello data fellows,
 Do you think that it generally makes sense to develop and invest a lot of time in improving technical skills in DL, as a generalist data scientist? Meaning, as someone that is not in research scientist/ML engineer position and/or doesn’t work in big-tech?
 I am not talking about being able to build a simple sequential model with Keras and feeding np arrays, but rather going much deeper with Functional/Subclassing APIs and then use tf.Datasets and generators to feed Tensorflow data pipelines.
 The reason why I am asking is that I love this stuff, but I don’t know how many firms outside of big tech use these technologies out there. If in the end all they expect/understand/value is knowing SQL and some basic Python, is it worth going down the more technical path? Will it give me an edge in the long run?
 Thanks for your feedback!
 A nice weekend everyone

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mini intro: I'm currently into my 3rd year of bachelor's in mathematics with a minor in data sciences. I decided on this path 2 years ago when I decided to venture out of my current field of engineering. So I have no experience in the tech field yet. 
 I'm studying part time and I'm not sure if I have the case of imposter syndrome or I really do feel inadequate. In classes, I think I do okay, as I help others with their codes. Please don't take me for boasting or flexing, I had a full time software engineer seeking help from me and praising me as well, and this further adds to my confusion because I can't think that I'm actually bad. 
 When I'm browsing LinkedIn, I see people at my level with very good portfolios, like reducing man-hours by 70% by implementing this-that algorithm etc in their internships. I'm applying for an apprenticeship that has a second assessment coming up and I just feel stressed even though I got past their first assessment. 
 Has anyone experienced this and how do I go about solving this?
