        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to know if this opportunity is good enough for my career path. I've given a summary of the events and my relevant experiences below:
 I've had experience as a data analyst at a tech company and before that I was doing business consulting projects. I got connected to an ERP company by one of my past colleagues and after one or two phone calls and a 20 minute phone interview about SQL stuff and accounting they told me I could have the job.
 My goal in my career is being a Data scientist who also does some of the analytics stuff for the company preferably focused on the business side of things but I like product-related tasks as well. This job includes mostly database administration tasks and trying to solve business problems for each client. 
 The good thing about the opportunity is getting familiar with many different businesses and improving my business understanding. The downside is that I would be a little away from the roles I most like (DA/DS). Also, I would be more on the operation side of business instead of decision making side.(and on top of that dealing with finance and accounting people which I most probably wouldn't enjoy). All in all, I really like getting to solve varied problems for different business clients but I feel like this move would be a little out of the way for my career. Thanks for reading this far. I would appreciate any advices or opinions you have about this.

 I'm trying to downsample this dataset to optimize the algorithm - I'm currently extracting some elements by the date (removing elements with less than 15 days intervals).
 But now, with that sample that I extract, I don't know how to ensure the quality of the data. How can I make sure that I don't lose any important info in the removed elements?
 ​
 TL;DR: How can I ensure the quality of info on downsampling compared with the original data?
 (I can't use correlation because of the different lengths of the original data and the filtered data.)
 (Language is not important, but I'm using Python)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I'm new here and I just want to rant and rave a little! 
 I studied statistics with a minor in programming in college. Afterward, started to work as an analytics campaign manager in a healthcare company. My job covered making sure the architecture was working correctly to using basic algorithms like K-means, and logistic regression to create campaigns to increase cx and sales. My job was very satisfactory in a way as I could see cancer patients struggling less or people would find they had cancer in the early stages and could get treatment before it was late. 
 ​
 Due to financial reasons, I decided to become a data scientist, did a master and found a job in Western Europe. I'm working at a consulting company where I just do the analytics and prepare presentations but all the interesting stuff like creating the solution, and presenting it to the client belongs to other people. I'm just doing my 'numbers magic' - whatever they asked me to do- and they do all the fun stuff. The worst part is whatever I do is just for companies to save money, it doesn't affect people in any way. 
 ​
 I can't go back to my old work because I have to stay in Europe to make the money and send it to my parents. And my visa allows me just to do technical jobs, nothing like marketing, sales etc... 
 ​
 I feel stuck but don't know what to do. I'm not asking for advice or anything, I just wanted to share, to relax a little.

 I'm modeling a Tweedie distribution on my dataset of counts in R. When I run a Tweedie distribution model and check results in R, my dispersion/scale parameter is very high, about 200. This is giving me very high p-values and an uncertain estimate. (When I manually set the dispersion parameter to 1, I get the same results as Poisson and a highly significant p-value estimates). How do I lower this dispersion for Tweedie without manually changing the dispersion parameter (cheating) to reduce p-values? Do I just drop points/outliers until it goes down satisfactorily to get significant results? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, thanks in advance for your advice.
 I'm trying to determine whether certain product feature improvements increased the number of monthly active users (active is defined as whether the user made a purchase in the last 28 days). We have the ability to A/B test but I'm getting stuck because this MAU metric is a moving window metric. If we run the experiment for exactly 28 days then I think calculating the impact to MAU is easy. But most of the time our experiments run for more or less days than 28 days. Below are a few scenarios to illustrate my point.
 Note: All scenarios are A/B tests where we split our user base into equal treatment and control groups. So far, I've been calculating "MAU Rate", which is the proportion of users who placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment.
  
Scenario 1: Run experiment for exactly 28 days. At the end of 28 days, simply compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order.
 Scenario 2: Run experiment for less than 28 days, say 14 days. At the end of the experiment, compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment. The issue is that this will include days from before the experiment started. If I use only the days during the experiment, then I'm not really measuring MAU since MAU is 28 days and the experiment ran for only 14 days.
 Scenario 3: Run experiment for more than 28 days, say 35 days. At the end of the experiment, compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment. The issue is that this will exclude data from the first 7 days of the experiment. If I use all the days during the experiment, then I'm not really measuring MAU since MAU is 28 days and the experiment ran for 35 days.
  
Does anyone have any advice on how to measure impact to MAU through experimentation? Thank you!

I have started reviewing my basic knowledge of Python in case R is too limited for complex analyses or applications. 
 Is it worth it? If it is, which sources would you recommend? I am using Kaggle´s Python course so far.

 I’m so tired.
 EDIT: This is an anecdotal experience I am sharing. Idk why some of y’all think I am making some wild statistical claim. I don’t do that for free in my time off. Relax.
 Quoting one of my earlier comments - “168 applications, 39 of which I sent with the masculine named resume. Dude I’m not trying to prove/debate gender discrimination in this post. Just let the fellow wistem homies know this is a possible help for them in tough times for everyone.” 
 Out of the latter 39 applications I got 3 interviews (in my desired industry), 2 offers and accepted 1. In the first 129 I only got 1 interview in my desired field. There were a handful of others interview calls for roles outside my industry. 
 I would like to reiterate how tired I am.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since I'm a Spanish teacher, I can discern which essays have been made by (generally) Google Translator, but I can't really prove it beyond saying "I know you didn't do this". Is there an IA to detect these kind of translated productions from a machine? It would be SUPER handy for language teachers.
 ​
 Thanks in advance and Happy New Year!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I’ve been working as a junior data analyst for the last 8 months. 
 The onboarding phase was really disorganised, I’d spend my time reading through documentation and getting familiar with whatever I could. 
 I got my first project to work on around 6 weeks into the job. It was suppose to be just a dashboard but ended up being an automation piece so it was taken over by senior members in the team. 
 My second project came along a few months later, but the data engineer has been having ongoing issues with the data being sent over from an external provider, so that’s been a blocker, but the data modelling and dashboard design is done. 
 I was given a third project 2 months ago, a simple data model clean up and redesign of an existing dashboard, that didn’t take long and the dashboard is live now.
 It is the new year now and I truly have nothing to do. The last 8 months has been me looking for work to do, I’ve asked to help out on other team member projects but they said they didn’t need it. We have a daily stand up where we give updates and talk about what we’ll be doing today. Today was the first day I couldn’t bs my way through the meeting and said I didn’t have an update. I feel really incompetent having nothing to do. It’s isn’t a fast paced company so there aren’t millions of things going on, and our data team didn’t exist just 4 years ago so the business doesn’t rely on us too much. 
 Only 3 projects in the last 8 months, is this normal? If you currently work in data was your first job similar to my experience?? I’m struggling to understand why they hired me in the first place, I don’t think there’s enough work for an extra person.
 Should I start looking for another job? I don’t want to come up to the one year mark without much experience under my belt. I want to be a crucial member of a team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post provides a complete tour of Generalized LL (GLL) parsing along with GSS (graph structured stack) and extraction of parse trees from SPPF (shared packed parse forest). This is part of my ongoing effort to document various parsing algorithms.
I am looking for feedback on structure as well as content as before.
Note: Pyodide takes a little time to initialize, but it should be faster to initialize than spinning up the binder service from Jupyter (but slower to execute).
This is the writeup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there fellow data nerds! Having just read 'story telling with data' by Cole and 'Accelerate' by Nicole I am looking for my next read.
 I stumbled upon the book 'designing data intensive applications' by Martin. Is the book still relevant today in 2023 as I can see the book is from 2017.
 The reason I ask is that I felt like the book 'Accelerate' isn't really relevant anymore as it was more focused on the data about why DevOps is good - with data from 2013-2015. Today I don't believe there is much discussion and that a clear consensus exists that DevOps is great. 
 Have anyone here read the book by Martin and can you recommend it in 2023?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im a 17 yo in Singapore taking CS in JC, have a background in competitive programming in cpp, coded some discord bots and done some CTFs etc. When I look for online courses for AI devs they seem to be teaching how to use certain pre-built/trained models like tensor and pytorch etc. 
 Would like to ask if any senior AI devs here start the same way (from online courses, basics of tensor/pytorch,..) or what are some better ways to start with AI dev? Also, is an AI's performance depends more on its code/model or the amount of training data? (as a solo-dev, i want to know if i should focus more on writing better code or sorting better training sets)
 thanks and have a nice day

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is a commonly held belief that achieving perfect language modeling is equivalent to achieving human-level intelligence. However, this belief has been challenged in recent years as language models have become more advanced and their capabilities have expanded. It is possible that, even with infinite compute power and no concerns about labor costs, a large language model alone may not be able to solve all problems or achieve true human-level intelligence. It is important to consider the limitations and capabilities of language models when evaluating their potential uses and applications.
 Shortly, the main concerns about using LLMs are:
  
Relating multiple texts to each other
 A notion of time
 Knowledge of Knowledge
 Numbers and math
 Rare events, high recall setups, high coverage setups
 Data hunger
  
Here is a twitter thread addressing these issues
 Here is an original large post about this
 Do you think these concerns will be gone with advancements in the field?
