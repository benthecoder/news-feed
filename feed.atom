What steps does it take to transform it into an application that can be actually used by external stakeholders, e.g, operations team? What does the process look like, what are the tools involved, and how long does the process take at your organization?

 I have the sales data for past 2 yrs, if I predicted the future sales using arima (or sarimax) won't that be just sales forecasting ? This seems simplest but most raw model. I've seen some people using keras and some people using other libraries..
 Please help me if anybody have designed anything similar in the past, 
 1) which libraries work well, how to use them ? 2) If I have to predict sales/demand of (each item * each warehouse* every day) how many times do I have to run the model, can I automate this ? 
 End goal is to improve logistical efficiency, lower cart abandonment due to non availability of certain item and reduce loss of perishables.
 Please help, I'm an absolute beginner .

 Context: I am planning to move to more reputable university with more theoretical approach and less real-world experience. But only if it is worth it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you guys find work within the company? I know this may sound like a stupid question, but I am just wondering if the problem already pre-exists for you to start your work and then it's assigned to you by your manager or if you have to look for a problem within the company to create work. 
 I just feel like if I am not pro-active enough as a Data Analyst to look for DS projects, then I am just defaulted into just data cleaning and general mundane reporting. The data cleaning and reporting have deadlines and it just seems hard for me to find time to do some research with the data and start a DS project within the company. Do I need to be more pro-active in letting my manager know that I would like some bandwidth to do some projects?

 If someone is mistaken or misusing a term, help them out and stop judging them. This field requires lifelong learning, and even the pros only know so much. It’s a very beautiful field of science and we should not be so snobbish about mistakes. We should help educate and spread the knowledge.

 I serve a ML model in production which is used to do targeting to propose job offers to people. Sometimes the model performs very well and provokes a lot of applications to these job offers but sometimes for some offers it gives less good results. 
 I wonder how to explain these events. 
 Nota Bene : The business stakeholdes create job offers that can be very similar (same city, same job and similar salary) and they can call our model on this job offers. Even if the offers are almost the same they have very variable performances
 As I was thinking about it, I didn't know of an explainability method to know why a model underperformed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My research group has models for agricultural pests that we are trying to move outside the academic realm (e.g. published papers or science bulletins) into a live decision support tool. While we have some of the talent in our group, the scope of the project requires bringing in some short-term expertise.
 Any tips on where to post such a search would be much appreciated! I haven't had much luck on LinkedIn or Upwork finding the right fit.
 I’m hunting for contract work for (1) someone with experience building front ends and html widgets primarily using JavaScript and (2) a consultant with experience putting cloud-based models into production that are accessible to moderate number of users. We don't need biologists, but some appreciation for that domain knowledge is highly valued.
 I’m also open to DMs for anyone interested – this could be a cool portfolio project since the entire pipeline will be open on GitHub and the decision support tool will be hosted on university websites!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And its not like my boss is allegedly non technical. Hes the head of data science and data engineering. After apparently only working in analytics.
 We joke, but if he doesn't know a harmonic mean, sure. Whatever, we can explain that. Maybe he doesn't know the nuts and bolts of how NN works. Whatever, that's management. But a classifier?
 Did he not at any point read even a 1 pager on data science? Like maybe browse the ol' Wikipedia on machine learning, get a high level layman's overview of the field.
 I mean he brags about the interviews he gives where i have to basically write the entire talk track on everything. From privacy, to clean rooms, to tech stacks. Which its like "dude its kinda your job to be able to talk about this stuff at a high level, maybe give a shit at all."
 But not knowing what a classifier is? Jesus i no longer feel bad for playing my steamdeck on calls I don't need to be on.
 Edit: 
  
An algorithm that implements classification, especially in a concrete implementation, is known as a classifier. The term "classifier" sometimes also refers to the mathematical function, implemented by a classification algorithm, that maps input data to a category.

 Though I'll cop to mistyping with regressor. Didn't realize I typed that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently tried representing my app users as documents and each interaction as a token to perform topic modelling using tf-idf + NMF and got sensible results. The descriptive 'topic' labels I came up with by observing the top transactions aligned very well with manual post-hoc analyses of other customer data. It was only today that I realised I had forgotten to scale my TF by document length (total interactions by the user). Re-ran the topic model again after scaling and got results which I felt made less sense and over-emphasised some very obscure app interactions. 
 Thought about the approaches for a bit but I can't quite wrap my head around whether I had made a fundamental mistake, or if somehow raw TF is the better method in my peculiar application, not least because: 
  
Having more interactions (more active user) is a good thing and is relevant information 
 Certain interactions are necessarily performed more frequently by the users who engage with them (e.g. daily challenges, features placed on the first page of the app)
 
Every user is bounded by a fixed range of possible things they can tap on in the app 
  
Appreciate any opinions on this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
 I am working on an object-detection task where I need to identify fractures in x-ray images. Currently I am using Faster-RCNN which works well for most cases, however in specific cases, information across the entire image is necessary in determining if an object/bone is indeed fractured - e.g. a clinician would look at the entire image (let's say it is a hand) and compare the swollenness of the finger in question, and compare to how the other fingers look for that specific person. In this case, information from far away in the image is essential to determining if the region is indeed a positive bounding box or not.
 My impression of Faster-RCNN is that while the FPN network does provide high-level features which can relate to the entire image, I typically notice that the task of object detection is to identify a bounding box containing a confined object (a car, a person, a bird) - not an object that is only present if the remainder of the image allows it to (e.g. a reflection of a car in a mirror should perhaps not be classified as a car-object).
 An idea could be to use attention-based networks such as a ViT in replacing the FPN in Faster-RCNN to get a broader image-feature-space but I have no idea if this will actually work in practice. Essentially I want the region-proposal part of the network to assess the context of the region it is looking at. I have also looked into DETR, but again it seems to be optimized and built towards "confined" object detection.
 Does anybody know if there are any studies on this, or does someone smarter than me know if Faster-RCNN is already able to accommodate these types of cases?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, brand new to this sub so I apologize if this has already been asked/isn’t the right place to ask, but I don’t know anyone who I can ask in person. I work in a tech-adjacent field, and want to start making moves over to the tech side. I want to eventually (within the next two years) enroll in a Masters program in data analytics or something similar. In the meantime however, I want to do some preliminary training because 1) I want to make sure I actually enjoy it and 2) all of my technical knowledge is from OJT, not formalized training per se. This means that I’ve become fairly skilled in some areas, but very lacking in others that aren’t directly applicable to my job. Anyways, I’ve been looking into Google professional certs as a way to “dip my toe in” without a massive financial commitment. First off, are these certs even worth it? And second, am I reading this correctly that you just have to pay for a coursera subscription, or are there other hidden tuition costs that I’m somehow missing? Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to switch careers to data science and luckily I got an internship in a good company which will be converted to a full time job after three months based on performance. Currently a task is there where we have to identify in a video if presentation slides are present and then take the screenshot of those slides. I looked into the basics of object recognition using opencv. But proceeding further I think I'll need a lot of data for identifying presentation slides and training a machine learning model to identify the object correctly. What will be your workflow suggestions? Which model and dataset can be useful for this? Also is there a better option than opencv? Please help or share your thoughts regarding this and any courses to learn from if possible.
