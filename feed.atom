        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to compare two groups of iterations of software versions of devices and check the number of errors that they have, and know which one in reality is bigger than the other.
 For example, in the software version of 2021 we have 120.000 errors with 20.000 devices, and for 2022 we have 200.000 errors with 50.000 devices. 
 We have the ID of the errors and how many times it happens by device and etc. It would be like the one below with much more columns. 
 ​
  
 error-ID error_quantity_2021 error_quantity_2022 
  
 001 1000 1300 
  203 400 1000 
  504 4000 2000 
 
 I ran a Wilcoxon test using each error code as a group and performed the analysis, but I would like you guys opinion about this as well.

 Hi all,
 I've been working as a data professional for about 4.5 years now and have been thinking about making the pivot to SWE for over a year, just have been spending my time learning more + building my portfolio. The reason is that I find myself enjoying writing code to automate things and create apps more than I really do linear regressions and analyses really. I also took some Udemy courses a while ago and really loved learning general python programming more so than I did a python for ML course.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I got this job at a big bank in October. I agreed to a smaller pay because I lacked certain experience and genuinely was pretty ignorant. I am a very quick learner and have an exceptionally good memory. Our team is very new to the bank and we have lots of initiatives and projects. As someone who doesn't forget and is good at keeping track I kind of took on a lot of duties and helped my team catch up with projects that we were behind on. 
 Now, I love my job and I love my boss. But is it normal for a junior with a lower pay to do all these things? At this point I am responsible for running and maintaining at least 3 credit risk models among other things. My boss and other higher ups recognize how much I contribute as well and I know if I don't keep up with some of these things probably Noone will. The impact of the models I run is huge as they are very visible. (2k people use it) 
 Do I ask for a raise? What are generally normal expectations of someone like me who came with little experience and junior level? I don't even know how to advocate for myself because I don't know how the industry works so any help is very appreciated 
 Thank you!!!!!

I work at that startup for 2 full days including one remote day. I discussed this with my boss two times and each time this was no problem at all. They asked me to come work for them and know that I have to travel much farther than the rest of the staff and have to deal with lectures and deadlines from my studies.
 This Friday, because of deadlines I could not join the Friday drinks, I got a Whatsapp message from my supervisor that although he said that afternoon that I could work from home on Monday, my boss said that I did not negotiate that with him. That seemed odd because we did talk about it two times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a web developer, and I recently realized that this is not my cup of tea. For some reason it has gotten very boring for me recently.
 I love programming and I'm now thinking of moving to other stuff within the programming realm. I'm thinking about Embedded systems and data science/AI. I haven't checked out Embedded systems yet, but I had started learning data science online a couple of times, but I always end up stopping for some reason. But I'm planning to stick to it this time.
  
How much do you enjoy data science and how challenging is it?
 Are there any courses you'd recommend? I'm fairly familiar with Python and have done some web projects using it. I saw that Kaggle has its own learning section. I don't know how good it is anyways.
 Any advice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a while now, I've been thinking of switching career. I currently work as Clinical Genetics Technologist, where my role is to conduct wet lab for various genetic testing and perform analysis on said testing results to be reported back to patients via physicians/genetic counsellors. My job has gotten pretty stale, repetitive, and healthcare in general feels very unrewarding, given the ever increasing workload post-pandemic but very low compensation in return. 
 I've been using my free education credits and continuing education hours to learn about tech in general. I took a part time Data Analytics course at a bootcamp and I really enjoyed it. SQL was really interesting, I didn't have any issue learning it and I breezed through the Excel part. I am now trying out Python Programming class - which is going well so far. I've been checking out FCC too just to check out software development but coding CSS is kinda not fun...
 I have no formal background in tech. My formal education is in biology which I followed through with an advanced diploma to become a certified clinical genetics tech. I took introductory calc, linear algebra, ODE and stats classes during my undergrad and they were easy but probably meant nothing to DS in general.
 I'm currently exploring around and checking out avenues for career change. DS sounds super interesting to me and ngl, the (average) pay will be a huge boost from my current job lol. For a beginner, what are some of the best things I can do to move into the field? I've been thinking of enrolling into an MSDS or a bootcamp but reddit seems pretty divided on it. I live in Canada for reference.
 Has anyone made the switch from healthcare to data science? Would love to hear your stories. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I came into data science from a physics background and early in my career I did a fair number of courses/textbooks to get myself up to speed. I'm thinking I should be continuing learning something (and get my company to pay) but I'm not sure what I should focus on. 
 This is a rough list of what I've worked on :
 Coursera applied data science with python Coursera machine learning Edx stat110x course Worked through ISLR, R4datascience Beyond the basic stuff with python
 I would say I'm pretty confortable with python, pandas and sklearn, having worked with lightGbm in my work too.
 I would appreciate any reccommendations of paid courses or things to look at! I'm not super keen on doing a masters as I already have two, but I have seen that there are micro masters out there like (https://www.edx.org/micromasters/mitx-statistics-and-data-science?utm_medium=partner-marketing&utm_source=paid-social&utm_campaign=mitx&utm_content=program-fb-a-fy23&gclid=CjwKCAiA8OmdBhAgEiwAShr40zb2H871mvZVPgSz5nF5tSXAwJTXPaJ-jaX-1HXIBZ4VZyoUJiuDxRoC0AIQAvD_BwE) though I imagine these courses will just repeat stuff I am already familiar with.
 Some gaps in my knowledge are :
 Advanced SQL Dev ops Neural networks and deep leaning Advanced statistics theory

I am taking amazon's stock price for a period of two years. I have transformed that into stationery by taking logs and then differencing by 1. 
 Splitting the original dataset, fit the model to the train one.
  
Doubt - How to transform back the transform data and which dataset? Transformed one or Predicted one.
 ​
 Please feel free to comment for any clarity, and I will clarify it.
 Or should I share my ipynb file?
 ​
 I have watched YT videos, but I couldn't find a satisfactory one.
 Provide any resources too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I turned 30 and this year, God willing, I will finish a PhD in marketing. I feel already late career-wise especially since I do not plan on going for academia and that it will have little to no effect on my career; TLDR, wasted a lot of time and I do not intend to lose more of it. 
 I plan on moving to Germany/Canada to pursue a career in data science even if I don't have any formal education in CS, but I am self-taught and about to get into the thick of machine learning, I should also mention that my phd helped me in that I have been exposed a lot to statistics.
 If things go according to plan, i.e., I get a position in data science, I do not plan to spend more than 5 years working for a company, I'd rather work independently. I was wondering how viable is a career in data science consultancy and whether it is financially justifiable compared to the more conventional track (working for a company)?
 I'd love to hear from people who went down the same track. In advance, thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title suggests, I’m currently a first year data science major and would like to land an internship in my sophomore year or in the summer of 2024.
 As far as data science goes, I really only have a basic understanding in R and python with no real idea of how they tie together. For R, one of my classes taught basic stats concepts along with R last quarter. For python I took a class that had me program games like custom battleship, connect 4, and other simple two player games.
 I’m a little lost on what I should be doing to gain more experience and ultimately be more competitive as an internship candidate.

 Cybersecurity has never had to make this argument in my experience. 
 Thinking I'll be working at least another twenty five years and I'm at a point to potentially retrain, I'd like to consider Cybersecurity but I don't know what the specific path would look like. I don't expect much overlap with Data Science, and I expect it to be a pretty large change. Is there any skills overlap? What's a good starting path?

 I want to create a website that allow the user to upload a file (in a standardized format, that contains the data but also the type of data for each column (categorical, numeric, etc)) and then generate some plots and summary statistics of the columns. Perhaps maybe also run a random forest model if you user specify the response they are interested in.
 I wonder what's the best way to create something like this. I know Python, R, Plotly, Matplotlib, SQL, a bit of Flask, HTML and CSS. I'm thinking about using Plotly for the plots due to its interactive feature. 
 Maybe a feature to export a PDF of the result would also be nice.
 Please advise. thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen a lot of thinkpieces regarding the likes of LLMs like ChatGPT, and what they signify about the future for AI and ML and society at large... but not a lot of teasing out of the business strategy behind OpenAI releasing what amounted to a tuned up version of GPT-3 a few months before GPT-4... especially for free... in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 It feels like it would be an interesting thought exercise, if nothing else to start thinking about it and what it could mean about what is going to happen in Q2, presumably when GPT-4 comes out. (With its massive parameter count that is rumored to be up to 500 times larger than GPT3).
 Obviously, there's the benefit of doing this early for exposure: tech companies are renowned for wanting to generate buzz for any number of reasons, and the freemium model is of course part of the playbook. 
 Then of course there's the training that they're getting from the public's qualitative assessment of what is being produced from the model.
 But I'm not entirely convinced those two factors are what is at play here.
 I'm thinking mainly in terms of the competitive landscape. Lamda (Google's LLM) has even more parameters than GPT4 but yet openAI was willing to expose its own competitive advantage (enough that a "code red" was called at Google HQ not long after the release).
 Then, I'm also thinking about Sankar tweeting out and then deleting that GPT4 Is proto AGI and will pass the Turing Test hands down. And of course Altman making the rounds in the podcast circuit dropping very interesting hints about how 2022 will seem "like a sleepy year for AI."
 My mind immediately goes to this was very much a trial balloon, testing the waters for how society will react to tech that will cause a massive and shocking shift.
 I'm wondering when you all think about this. Why release GPT 3.5? What are they doing? What do you think it serves for them? What does it say about GPT-4 could bring?
 Edit: added context
