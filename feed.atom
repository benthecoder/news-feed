 I did a WoE balancing on my training data set using the target.Now I have the test set without any labels that I want to balance as well to use the model to predict and submit.
 I am looking for some help on how to do it.set

They then introduce the microkernel concept. Are there microkernel concepts out there (especially code) I can check out? I'm curious to see how userspace processes communicate to kernel processes to execute privileged actions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you deal with changing features in a regression problem? I imagine this is quite common in a product/marketplace company. Here's an example:
 Let's say the task is predicting car prices for an online marketplace, a value you'd like to present to someone about to list their car on the site. You can use your marketplace's historic sales as a training set. However, as the marketplace evolved, more features were added to the car object, and maybe some stopped being used. E.g., in the early phase of the marketplace, you had 3 features: car model, year, and color. Then maybe later on the company stopped collecting color, and instead now collect MPG and transmission type. So now you have 4 features on the newer dataset: car model, year, MPG, and transmission type. And so on and so on...did you just impute the missing values? not use features that are missing data? Split test/train to only reflect current features? Is it a constant game of cat and mouse keeping up with the fresh features?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/datascience! I'm dropping by to show off a new platform I'm calling "Artemis" that's intended to serve as mission control for data science teams. It will be releasing soon, free to individuals and academic institutions, but I want your feedback as the finishing touches are refined.
 Artemis is one platform that allows you to document, aggregate, search and share your data science scripts with your team. I'll keep this short by leaving a link that lets you interact with a live demo version of the platform right here. 
 If you like it, that's great! Click the link to be notified of our impending free release. If you hate it we REALLY want to hear why -- click the link to tell us why! <notification/feedback link>
 If you're keen for a brief read: 
 Working in data science roles at Mayo Clinic and Caltech, I was frustrated by the inefficiency of monorepos. With teams of any size, it was a challenge to a) document our scripts in a way others could understand and b) find the script you're looking for. I build Artemis to solve this problem by offering:
 1- A new way to give your scripts visual documentation that shows, not tells, what each section of code actually does. Add special in line comments Artemis can read then run your script with our command line utility to generate documentation you can use to step through your code. It's a doozy to explain in full via a Reddit post, but you'll see in the demo that it's really not that complex.
 2- A new dashboard to aggregate, share and search your scripts. You can post the Artemis documentation for your scripts to our dashboard where they display beautifully to your team (please, just look at the demo). Each post contains your interactive documentation, the GitHub link to the script, links to related files, a written description and a title. The goal here is that your team can have an internal app store of sorts that makes it easier for each member of your team to borrow bits of code and entire scripts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So you moved your apps off Heroku, where did you go to and how has it worked out?
Particularly interested in:
1. How much work it took to move apps (be honest)
2. How much experience you had at the time of the migration - e.g. on one extreme your entire devops experience may consist of just Heroku (that's me) or on the other extreme you may be a k8s guru (this helps others gauge how they'll go)
3. How valuable were your learnings? E.g. replacing Heroku with an IAAS instead of another PAAS might take longer but give more fundamental learnings, and hence be worth it for some
4. Cost comparison
5. Summary/description of your apps (e.g. 20 tiny apps with a few hits per month, 5 medium with ~20k hits per month, 2 large with 1-2m hits per month type thing). Please give language/framework.
6. Anything else you want to add

 To give a little bit of background on the heading of this post, I've been working in a Big 4 (India) as a Technology Strategy Consultant for 2 years. Apart from that, my undergraduate background was a BSc. in Statistics, so I've had a little bit of experience in using tools like R, Python, Power BI and SQL. 
 I have been looking externally for roles that allow me to explore analytics, however it is difficult to pivot without any technical hands on experience. I have also lost touch with the tools mentioned above, as my day to day work in my Management Consulting role involves creating PPTs and working on Excels primarily.
 I finally reached out to the analytics team internally in my company, and they have said they are looking to deploy folks on a SQL project and would be willing…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI, another version of the i-life. At least Apple put i-first. Actually, how about anti-i-life? Here, following the operation left to right, you’re operated on first. No thanks, not interested. In many ways your intelligence is already anti (negated) by those with power over you. AI represents a terminal point of the technocracy. AI is the antithesis of sovereign individual intelligence.
 Technology platforms are committing entire categories to AI, medium included. AI is all around us, as if being forced onto us. It honestly feels coercive. We are in the middle of a bubble right now, well, maybe more like a quantum foam. We’ve been automating processes since the industrial revolution, automation is nothing new. You have nothing to worry about, well maybe your job if you work in tech (I’m sure you’ve seen the news).
 Do you honestly think all of this has arisen out of the pure intellectual curiosity of the masses? No, this obsession is being forced upon us by those seeking to ride this wave of investment dollars as long as they can. People are being paid to write about AI. The goal is to captivate the mind while convincing you there is simply no point in resisting. They seem to suggest you should take your own intellect and multiply it by negative one. The message appears something like: “Trust it because you’re not even intelligent enough to trust in your own intelligence.”
 Tech is stagnating and the Metaverse is gasping for breath. We are in the beginning stages of a re-quantization of human prioritization. Surely you’ve heard of The Great Reset. Well, what’s the point in resetting a system only to get the same outcome? I think we need A Great Re-quantization. A movement of individual thought.

 I am an absolute novice in data science. I came up with this first example "distplot" in the seaborn module. The list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] which I provided to distplot, I just don't understand the output it gets me on both X-Axis and Y-Axis.
 The X-Axis gets me the values like -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 which I have no idea what it demonstrates.
 The example with the output link below shows you both the X and Y-Axis graphical demonstration.
 Example
 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns sns.distplot([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) plt.show() 
 Output: W3Schools Tryit Editor

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aside from basic descriptive statistics, e.g. mean, median, variance, etc. and basic graphical methods, scatter plot, histogram, time series plot, etc. Surely you calculate means and variances and make various visualizations quite often, yes?
 How often do you use a t-test to compare means? ANOVA (simple or more advanced versions)? Goodness of fit (of some variety)? Linear regression? Multivariate linear regression? Perform an analysis of model fit using some information criterion? Other advanced statistical methods?
 The purpose of the question is to decide on what is the ideal list of (advanced) statistics topics a data scientist should know.

 ​
 I'm currently a senior level analyst, and perform a decent amount of "Datascience" work already. I am 100% self-taught though, so my portfolio and resume don't exactly line up.
 Recently my boss and I discussed a title/pay change from Sr Analyst to Datascientist [or something akin to that], and he wanted a quick "proof of knowledge" that he could show to upper-management/HR for approval.
 The way he talked about it, it sounded like he was looking for a certificate (company paid for) or some other program that provides a "proof of knowledge". I'd like to do this the honest/"right" way, so ideally I'm looking for something that's not just handed out to anyone with a little Tableau/SQL experience.
 ​
 Any suggestions? Since the company is paying for it, I'd be game to hear suggestions for moderate/advanced courses that are helpful too!
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I'm currently in quite the Dilemma regarding data science/analytics internships. For reference I am currently a rising junior attending a large state university Studying Economics with minors in Statistics and Mathematics. I've been fortunate enough to intern in an Analytics/Modeling role at a large fortune 50 insurance company and also have DevOps experience at a lab.
 Recently though I've been applying to summer 2023 internships and was able to get multiple offers at several large companies. I've narrowed down my offers to two different companies which I will briefly describe.
 Company 1: Large Fortune 500 Banking/Credit firm, located on the east coast, with a high 'prestige' name. Pure Data Analytics Internship (Dashboards, Reporting, SQL, Automation, ETL, etc).
 Company 2: Medium Sized Car Automotive group, located near my current university, offering a pure Data Science Internship (Focus in pricing, loans and credit modeling)
 Ideally I would love to work in Fintech moving forward which is one of the main reasons Company 1 stands out. However moving to Company 1 would be a pain regarding location as I would have to travel across the nation.
 Additionally the experience I could gain at Company 2 seems great, there business model relies heavily on the data science team to develop production level models. Further I've met the team I would be working with and could tell I could learn a ton from them.
 I am aware that the prestige I could gain from Company 1 would be immense, however I am weary to chose the role just because I'm worried it will only lead to more data analyst internships down the line (which I would ideally like to avoid).
 Further, I'm very passionate about ML/econometrics/statistics and although I understand and appreciate the power of pure analytics, I'm worried I could see myself getting bored in a strictly analytics based role.
 I would really appreciate any input or thoughts!

 I am an Irish Data Scientist sitting in Kranidi with my fiancée and soon to be mother and father in law. There are many cats here - and I am a cat lover and father of two lovely domestic short hairs. I tried to pet this lovely cat but she was too skittish, but I did snap this picture. My soon to be father-in-law (STBFIL) is a brilliant interventional cardiologist and he believes this is a Ghost Cat. 
 I slightly believe this but my education calls me to reason that this image is using multiple pictures and the phone is programmed to use a summation function over the pixels between images to sum the vectors and make it appear that the cat is transparent. I promise that the cat is not behind the glass! I know this from seeing the cat before taking the picture and remembering the event well. What do you think? Does anyone have an explanation for me and my STBFIL?

 I have 3 months before college starts. Currently using this time to get my math skills refined up to calc with a focus on making linear algebra effortless. 
 What else should I be doing during this time?
 Once in college, what should I be doing to have the best possible position and opportunity after graduating?
 Specific Clubs? Specific Skills? Specific Networks? 
 Lastly, what do you consider to be the hardest skills to "learn" or "teach" that someone should possess before considering this field
 Do you think Data Science requires a specific "type" of person? Or do you think anyone could do what you do with enough time and practice?

 I already looked up the meaning in some textbook but was not able to form a coherent picture encompassing all terms
