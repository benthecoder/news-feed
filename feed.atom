        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm dirt poor. Everyone here should know that.
So my phone has been failing to charge for three weeks and I bought a new phone today and can't get it set up because the old one is dead and I can't get a verification code. So I moved the old sim card on the advice of one of my sons and the codes are still going to the old physical phone and Google says it will send me a link in 72 hours.
Google is convinced I'm trying to break into my own accounts because I can't get access to codes on my dead phone. So I may lose my access to my google account, my blogs, etc.
If anyone has contacts at google and can tell them, yea, verily, Doreen Michele Traylor is a real person who is real poor and we all know her and please let her keep her phone number and her (my full name) google account and get me out of this fucking nightmare, that would be coolios.
Please and thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm just wondering if you fine folks have any recommendations for a beginner in DS who's looking to polish their resume with some freelance work on platforms like Upwork.
 Bit of background: I'm an electrical engineer by trade and worked in sensor and robotics development for about four years. I also have quite a bit of knowledge in Python and CV/ML libraries, but have only ever used them internally (never actually delivered a software solution to another team). In that time, I also did an MBA so I'd say my business knowledge is okay.
 I decided I wanted to switch out of "regular" engineering and more into ML/ data engineering and am now doing a master's in engineering to specialize in ML/CV. Also did Google's Coursera course on data analytics, so I have some knowledge of SQL, Tableau, etc...
 I guess my main question is, given that I have never actually worked for a software team or in a formal DS position, can anyone slip me any pointers on other things I should know/practice or courses I should take before putting myself out there for freelance work? Obviously, at some point, I need to just jump in, but I'd like to avoid mistakes that are obvious to people in the industry but not so much to newcomers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I received an offer to work as a contractor with a FAANG. The pay would be reduced from my FT job (probably 10-20% depending how much I can negotiate), and I wouldn't get benefits. 
 I was wondering if it'd be worth it leaving my job, where I haven't done too much data science work, to work at a FAANG as a contractor. AFAIK there's no stipulation that says I can't say I worked at this FAANG on my resume. Also, is there any specific thing I should look out for? Or anything I should ask the recruiter in advance?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Was put forward for a cloud engineer role but told the recruiter I was more interested in an ML engineer role and he said I could call myself whatever I wanted on LinkedIn/ CV even if it’s not what I’ll be doing. 
 He even gave examples of other people calling themselves directors instead of managers because they wanted to portray as if they still did engineering themselves. 
 Is this common? It feels a bit disingenuous to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anynbody here come from a ECE/Telecommunications/DSP Background and could tell me more about how they got into Data Science? I'm currently enrolled in a Msc in ECE in France, which gives me a lot of freedom to choose what i want to study after that first batch of mandatory courses. I'm very much into the more mathematical/theoretical stuff like DSP and Communications Signal Processing, which have a lot to do with Statistics, Linear Algebra and Systems and Signals, but hate the eletronics and eletromagnetism courses, like RF/Microwave and Circuit Design. In fact, i belive that i would much rather do something that had more to do with people and how people Interact with technology than how to actually build it and have to use the Smith Chart any other day in my Life. I wanna use tools like Statistics and programming to solve Business Problems, not building Large Scale Integrated Circuits. So i was wondering if someone else here had a similar experience and if you think that a Background in Signal Processing or Electrical Engineering is helpful (and how helpful it is) for someone who is considering getting into Data Science. What would someone with that Background have to do to break into the field?

 I have been working as a Data Scientist for a couple of years now, having experience in the fields of urban economics, mobility, public safety and real estate development. 
 I love this intersection between cities and data science. I was wondering if anyone else has similar interests and would like to study more on these applications.
 I would be very interested to have a place to share experiences, collaborate on hands-on projects and discuss research papers.
 This field can be very broad, but I think we can limit it depending on the interest of the people involved.

 def getScoreFromBoard(board): return engine.analyse(board,chess.engine.Limit(time=1))['score'].pov(chess.WHITE)
 extendedBoardsArray = [] # THIS IS WHERE THE AROUND 1 MILLION BOARDS ARE KEPT
 boardsWithEval = pd.DataFrame([x,getScoreFromBoard(x)]for x in extendedBoardsArray)
 I dont see any other way to apply a user-defined function efficiently to a dataframe. I am running all these on a google colab pro notebook if it matters.
 EDIT: I am unable to rewrite the function as it is the built-in evaluation function from stockfish library.

By analyzing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) data with a framework that combines exploratory, explanatory and predictive analyses, the authors were able to identify patterns and structures that could be used to detect the long-term effects of the virus. The findings suggest that graph analytics can provide more accurate and comprehensive insights compared to traditional methods and have important implications for efforts to detect, track and combat pandemics like COVID-19.

 I need advice on writing a proper job req to properly set expectations on the role. 
 I’m looking to hire “data analyst” for a role within a cutting edge tech company, of which has less than 2500 employees. Their main job will be to help develop an internal website that will showcase near real-time data analysis dashboards, etc that the rest of the company will use to prioritize development. 
 I am approved to hire a “data analyst” but need them to have the necessary skills to do the above. 
 What’s a proper job title and description details to make sure people know upfront what I’m looking for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys, I'm a DS at a Fintech company and I'm facing a particular problem that I need some advice.
 The Marketing team of our company wants to work on a Cross Selling Model. But, they are not interested in New Users, they want to know who are the users that we currently have that did not Cross Sell into another product but are more likely to do it.
 So, in my mind, I was prepared to work on New Users, the population of our model would be New Onboardings of Product A, and our target would be the Users that Cross Sell to Product B in a time frame since they acquire Product A. But they are not interested in this.
 So base on the requirements of the problems, it seems more likely a Look Alike model, do you agree with that? 
 I was thinking also on giving them our train score predictions, in my mind, what they were asking for are the False Positives, I mean, when the model predicts that the user will cross sell but it was a mistake.
 Any advice of how to tackle the problem would be appreciated.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there! Just want to share some tips on how to craft the right chatbot when everyone talks about ChatGPT. First of all, a custom chatbot company or any chatbot platform that does custom integration can integrate your chatbot with ChatGPT instead of Dialogflow. So yeah, you can have an outstanding customer service chatbot that can handle other topics. However, the right question is should you? 
 If you want a chatbot that does solve issues, not creates more, you must start with the proper requirements. Well-structured chatbot requirements lay the right foundation for your future chatbot development. ChatGPT is just one of the options of how you can use AI and automation and may be not the best depending on your budget and goals. 
 Your chatbot requirements should include these steps:

 I started my career as a SEO specialist for a marketing agency (iProspect) in Singapore.
 I really enjoyed the working environment which was focused on performance and personal growth. Being with specialists coming from different backgrounds makes it ideal to learn things very quickly. Also anytime you have an issue, there is always someone with more experience willing to help you.
 I recently moved to a data analyst role in-house and I’m starting to miss the agency environment.
 What are some big agencies that would offer data analysis / data engineering services for clients with (if possible) both departments mixed up so I could easily have access to both knowledge?
 Also bonus if the agency doesn’t only focus on specific area/field/industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I am currently working on a project where I use Python’s data science libraries to generate graphs and various visualisations on data (eg using Pandas, Seaborn etc.). Ultimately, I’m looking to put all of these graphs and models into a PowerPoint- like presentation in a way that 1) the graphs are linked to a database, 2) the graphs get updated automatically if anything changes in the database, 3) I have a clean layout of text, pictures and models all together.
 I am hence looking at tools that can help me achieve that. I see that Google slides integrate with Python through the gslides library but I haven’t found many examples of what it can generate. Jupyter notebook is another option but I’m not sure how a presentation like PowerPoint can be created in it (so far I’ve only really used JupyterNotebook for reporting purposes). Is there any tools I could look at?
 Thanks, any help is much appreciated !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if posts like this aren't allowed, but as an entry-level DS, I'd love to hear what folks have to suggest regarding this problem I'm trying to solve.
 My company works with two blogger clients: client A with around 5k total monthly readers and client B with around 100k. Each has a newsletter they promote via a CTA that appears on every page view, and, on average, A gets about 20 new subscribers per month for the newsletter, while B does 800.
 For each client, my task is to find a "smarter" way to display this CTA to readers than merely showing it on every page view, sort of a question of figuring out the "when" for each reader so as to improve conversion rate. I have full clickstream data of every reader's page visit along with dwell time, maximum scroll depth, referrer, type of device, etc. as well as every time a reader submits a newsletter signup form. 
 What kinds of models would you recommend looking into? Would you consider plain predictive ML or something powered by causal influence (which I've seen is in vogue these days)? Whatever the approach, it'd be great if it could still work with (what I think is) the very small training set I can get out of A's data.
 Thanks!

 The vampire was searching for a way to break the curse that had been placed on her. She had tried everything, from potions to spells. Nothing seemed to work.
 One night, while wandering the castle, she stumbled upon a secret chamber. Inside the chamber, she found a mysterious chest. When she opened it, she discovered a beautiful set of lingerie: a pink bra, bow panties, and a narrow waist cincher.
 The vampire was delighted by the find. She quickly changed into the lingerie and admired her reflection in the mirror. Her cleavage and navel were revealed, and her fangs peeked out from her lips. She felt beautiful and powerful.
 In the background, a faint aqua-colored light glowed. The vampire felt drawn to it and stepped closer. Suddenly, the light intensified, and the vampire found herself surrounded by a bright blue background.
 It was then that the vampire realized the lingerie was enchanted. She had been freed from the curse! The lingerie had been a gift from a secret admirer, and the light was a sign of the vampire’s newfound freedom.
 The vampire celebrated her newfound freedom and vowed to use her powers for good. She often wore the lingerie under her clothes as a reminder of her special night. The lingerie was now her signature look, and she was often seen wearing it with a simple background.
 And so, the vampire lived happily ever after, her fangs and lingerie forever a reminder of her magical night.

 Ofcourse it will take us to understand qualia , consciousness and it's mechanism to know whether reinforcement learning based artificial agents can experience suffering. For this we need to understand what cause us to experience and can artificial intelligence gain consciousness and probably suffer due to reinforcement learning. Basically we need theory of consciousness and probably some other ways to confirm if there's any sense of experience that artificial agents might have developed.
 But if somehow we have a possibility of artificial intelligence gaining consciousness, then we need to make sure we don't cause suffering to such artificial intelligence based agents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 Our professor at school likes Weka and makes us use it for training on the algorithms.
 He also has slides on classification rules and talks about rule-based algorithms like PRISM, Ripper and DTNB and is asking us to use them on some dataset.
 I was wondering, as I'm not finding much information about these algorithms, if they're outdated / not competitive enough nowadays, have you ever used them in a professionnal setting...
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that I have graduated from college, I am so clueless what path to even move forward in and not be afraid of being laid off later on. Seeing how good Chatgpt and AI art has become, i don't even know what skill to master myself in because there will be a robot better than me at that same skill. 
 There are data scientists and software engineers who gave Chatgpt a prompt/code to find an error and give a detailed analysis/solution to that prompt. So far, it has been scarily good. 
 I see artists living on the edge not knowing when their branding or graphic design job will be taken away from them. Chatgpt may take over journalism. 
 I am ready to learn and adapt. I just want to know where to start from. The idea of investing my time in learning the "wrong" thing that would eventually turn obsolete is making me confused.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being a college student and using this tool to help me study for finals, I have found a huge increase in productivity. For example, it helped me create study guides in seconds, rather than hours. 
 I am wondering what university professors think about this and if anyone has any predictions about how schools will look like now that we have an AI that can literally give you all the answers to a given test with very high accuracy!
 I’m especially interested in us CS students, who can greatly benefit from such a tool. How would professors impose restrictions of this tool on projects or homeworks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for options to work flexible hours as a data scientist. I value my free time more than my paycheck. I'm looking to work part time full remote (just grind out 20 hours a week instead of working 40 hour corporate job). I have a couple years experience as a DS under my belt, mostly in DoD, which is not friendly to working remotely outside the US. So I'm thinking of maybe working for a consulting company or big tech consulting (AWS or azure) for a year to get experience, then jump into some type of 1099 contracting role with my own LLC that I would setup.
 What I'm thinking is to approach startup or smaller companies, who can't afford to hire a data scientist full time at $200k, but they still could leverage data expertise on a part time basis. From my job, I've realized the most data immature companies have the greatest marginal return, where they have some data management need that's tied to their bottom line. I would come in, help them setup a cloud environment, data management practices, ETL system, any type of algorithm if it's required, tie it to some relevant output (dashboards, reports, etc.), and then teach someone at the company how to operate it. (I've done this with analysts at my job) then I can return periodically to maintain the product for them. 
 My goal would be to work no more than 10-20 hours per week at $100/hr. What do you guys think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Profile - Canadian. 29y/o. Masters in Data Science.
 Early 2019 - Data Scientist at the start of my career. Loved every second of it.
 2020 - Became a Finance consultant for a $90k/year package (only for money) where I only use Excel.
 2022 - 3 years on, I'm still stuck in this consulting firm with a $100k/year package and no promotion. I seem to have lost my Data Science skills.
 My skillset includes Data Science technologies and bullshit consulting projects where I help settle bank books. I have a gift for bullshitting in interviews and at this point I've fabricated my entire resume with consulting projects turned into data science projects from the last 2 years.
 I've been busting my head for the last 6 months on LinkedIn trying to find jobs where I can get back into the data science industry but I cant find anything where I can leverage the last 3 years of my life. I'm desperate to progress in my career. My peers who started on 60k, 3 years back have reached 100k but I'm still stuck at the same rung in my career ladder. I feel like I've wasted the last 3 years of my professional career.
 But what should be my next step? I cant seem to find any niche/opportunities to develop in. How do I progress towards a better job? Should I stay in consulting or leave and go back to Data Science?
