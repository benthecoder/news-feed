 I'm a senior data scientist with 5+ years of experience mostly on marketing and product. I've spent my whole career in startups and tech and am honestly just tired of it at this point.
 Nothing is stable, priorities, technology, and competition are constantly changing. Moreover, although you see all these tiktok tech influencers showcase their cushy jobs, I have always found that tech is extremely demanding on your mental energy. This has only worsened for me since covid as wfh also means you always have to be on and available even in my own home. 
 Is this what it's like across other industries as well? Are there any chill jobs where I don't always have to be on my A-game?

 I've been a software engineer for 3 years and don't have the quantitative background at the moment as my degree was in business. A lot of the good data science masters (ones at a good University) require bachelor's in highly quantitative subjects whereas both these masters are at a good University and I can get onto them if I complete short courses in calculus and algebra that are at university level. I'm wondering whether they would be a good first step into the field
 What are your thoughts?

 Hey guys, I’m the cofounder of a tech startup focused on providing free AI services. We’re one of the first mobile multipurpose AI apps.
 We’ve developed a pretty cool app that offers AI services like image generation, code generation, image captioning, and more for free. We’re sort of like a Swiss Army knife of generative and analytical AI.
 We’ve released a new feature called AAIA(Ask AI Anything), which is capable of answering all types of questions, even requests to generate literature, storylines, answer questions and more, (think of chatgpt).
 We’d love to have some people try it out, give us feedback, and keep in touch with us.

 I was working on a personal experimental project related to GPT-3, which I thought of making it open source now. It saves much time while working with LLMs.
 If you are an industrial researcher or application developer, you probably have worked with GPT-3 apis. A common challenge when utilizing LLMs such as #GPT-3 and BLOOM is their tendency to produce uncontrollable & unstructured outputs, making it difficult to use them for various NLP tasks and applications. 
 To address this, we developed Promptify, a library that allows for the use of LLMs to solve NLP problems, including Named Entity Recognition, Binary Classification, Multi-Label Classification, and Question-Answering and return a python object for easy parsing to construct additional applications on top of GPT-n based models.
 Features 🚀 
  
🧙‍♀️ NLP Tasks (NER, Binary Text Classification, Multi-Label Classification etc.) in 2 lines of code with no training data required
 🔨 Easily add one-shot, two-shot, or few-shot examples to the prompt
 ✌ Output is always provided as a Python object (e.g. list, dictionary) for easy parsing and filtering
 💥 Custom examples and samples can be easily added to the prompt
 💰 Optimized prompts to reduce OpenAI token costs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a Data Analyst with a Physics background. Throughout my degree I really enjoyed deriving equations, and fully understanding where things came from - pen and paper style. I liked learning and knowing the fundamentals.
 When I was doing my PhD and applying statistical techniques, I similarly liked trying to calculate certain things myself by hand in simple scenarios (such as a t-test with not too many data points), rather than always using pre-programmed functions. I had a lot more time to dedicate to learning and checking things made sense.
 In my work now as an analyst, whilst I get L&D time, I just don’t have the time anymore to thoroughly check over things and make sure they make sense. I just have to trust that the R functions are doing what I expect. I have to trust that my chi-squared test is doing what I think, for example. Or that my logistic regression is producing a reasonable output. 
 I can’t remember the last time I got a pen and paper out and had to differentiate or integrate something, or multiply matrices, or work out the Fourier transform of a function.
 Maybe I’m just being nostalgic and having imposter syndrome but it feels like I’m slowly forgetting all of that underlying maths, and that I’ll end up at the point where I can do basic statistical programming and nothing more.

 I build a dashboard or report or automated tool and showcase it to data colleagues in other departments for feedback and adoption. Next thing I know, an executive is driving an all-employees mtg and praising someone else for my work because they showed it to that exec. That other person gets invited to leadership mtgs, then promoted. This has happened several times in two different companies.
 Am I blowing this out of proportion? Should I stop collaborating? Is this common or am I just unlucky?

Just finished a meeting with a professor at my uni who seemed multitudes more educated and intelligent then I am in the current state of my “career”. We chatted back and forth for around an hour about techniques and avenues of approach given different starting disciplines (stats vs computer science, etc).
 The book we’re reading in class, that I doubt anyone besides me has opened since so far it’s very slow, has some of his published works and data used for a really cool project he did with his PHD. To refrain from giving up my anonymity I’m not going to disclose what it was but I was like damn after the convo.
 I want to hear all the coolest shit you guys out there have done, ranging from research avenues, to professional settings, to whatever stuff you cooked up on your own time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I come from a Finance and Markets background, but not too much quantitative. 
 I've done my Calculus and linear algebra exams, but I'm pretty aware that I forgot a lot of things, and indeed to be properly capable again of doing all the exercises and all the cases I should start from scratch again, wasting months. 
 Now, my question is: is worth it in order to pursue a career in data science/analytics jobs to be pretty skilled in all the calculus and linear algebra exercises, and could be a better way to learn to apply these concepts with Python libraries instead to make each exercise and typology by hand?
 I'm aware that Data science is more statistics than math, but I heard that being "fluent" in calculus and linear algebra for machine learning is a must. But I'm confused if it is necessary to be capable of doing all the math by hand instead of libraries. 
 Any suggestions? Thanks. I hope I've been clear.
 P.s: I'm ok with statistics using Python, but even there I would not be capable of doing an exam again by hand, I forgot a lot of formulas, and to work on a project by hand I should have all the formulas and old solved exercises in front of me to consult because I forgot that skill, doing other exams such monetary economics or law exams.

 A few days later, I received an email saying they'd like to fly me out to their offices. And my travel date would be ~2.5 weeks into the future (which is surprisingly far out, I thought).
 Has anyone else been asked on site after a final-round interview? I think that they're either interested in me or buying time while another candidate considers their offer. Thoughts?

We just launched the ability to sync data from your own app/db/data warehouse to any of your customer’s Google Sheets, CSV, or Excel – and I wanted to share a bit more about how we built the Google Sheets integration. If you’re curious, see here for a quick GIF demo of our Google Sheets destination: https://storage.googleapis.com/hn_asset/Prequel_GoogleSheets....
Quick background on us: we make it easy to integrate with and sync data to data warehouses. Problem is, there are plenty of folks who want access to their data, but don’t have or don’t know how to use a data warehouse. For example, FP&A teams, customer success teams, etc.
To get around that, we added some non-db destinations to Prequel: Google Sheets, CSV, and Excel. We had t…]]></summary>

 As stated in the title, even though I did a lot of research into the Hertie School (Berlin, Germany) and its Master of Public Policy in Data Science program, I feel like I might not be a good fit (or yes?). Here are some elements that make me think:
 (1) I looked at the faculty directory and there are not many professors with expertise in data science in the school (a significant professor is leaving the school in the next academic year). What I really want is to master my data skills. I may not fully immerse myself in the data part. And the school is new so I can understand that. At this point, I was about to email them my refusal. 
 (2) However, I then talked to one alumnus who currently works in the school's Data Science Lab. And he is so smart and inspiring. He is also a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What I've used so far
 So far, I have used some AI tools for text generation, where you give it a prompt, set a tone, maybe do some little configuration of what you want, and it gives you text options. I have also used some online tools using Google Colab. Though my experience was not smooth maybe due to a slower internet speed I have where I live. All the more reason I'm exploring a locally-operated machine as I have a 3x GPU workstation that's not being used (I used it for Folding@Home but had some issues).
 I am not looking for the level that OpenAI's GPT-3.5 is in.
 What I am looking for:
 I wish to use it for assisted writing purposes for an internet cafe I operate. I can put together a workstation with 3-4 graphics cards, let's say. I currently have three spare GTX 1660 Ti from my home as well. Is this sufficient for smaller tasks using some sort of open source or free transformer language model like GPT-J or Kobold AI? I'm okay with slower results. Mainly, I wish to set it up and help others create small form content, automated text on some topic, blogs, maybe some social media captions, school assignments, etc. for personal uses as this will be a shared workstation.
 If there is a workflow but one that requires vastly superior computation power, I'm okay with a text generator with limited datasets and speed.
 Also, what is the possibility of custom training? None of the people using it will want to write code, for example. I've seen datasets that have a vast amount of training from Stack Exchange, for example. Is there a model where I can feed custom datasets, or remove the Stack Exchange dataset and input another?

 Sam Altman Might Have Just Pulled Off The Coup Of The Decade
 Microsoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!
 There is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, free of economic pressures.
 The fear is that OpenAI’s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.
 However, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.
 To understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!
 To appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let’s first look at Sam Altman’s backstory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I am trying to find the best multidimensional combination of parameters for an application based on a given metric by using bayesian optimisation to search the parameter space and efficiently find the most optimal parameters with the fewest number of evaluations. The model gives some sets of parameters, some that it has a high prediction of the metric, and others it has high uncertainty about. 
 These 2-300 outputs per cycle are then experimentally validated, and the accumulated results fed back into the model to get a better set of parameters for the next iterations for a total of about 6 iterations (12-1500 data points total) . The search space is large, and there are a limited amount of iterations that can be performed. 
 Because of this, I need to evaluate several surrogate models on their performance within this search space. I need to evaluate the search efficiency (how quickly can each one find the most optimal candidates e.g one will take 3 cycles, the other 8, other 20 etc) and the theoretical proportion of the search space that each model can search given the same data e.g 20% of the search space given 3% experimentally validated data from the search space.
 I am using the BoTorch library to build the bayesian optimisation model. I also already have a set of real world experimental data from different cycles from the first model I tried. 
 I would like to know how to go about evaluating these models for the search efficiency and design space uncertainty, any thoughts are welcome. 
 Thanks.

Hoping to see more in-depth data science discussion rather than students trying to justify that data science is worth going into or how to break into data science from another career.

 Are there better sub reddits to be in besides this where more advanced topics are discussed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just been wondering why people have been able to develop AI models such as GANs and more recently diffusion models that are so good at creating images but music generation has remained somewhat stagnant.
 From what I understand, there are two ways AI are generally trained on music: through MIDI files and using raw audio. The MIDI files are probably easier for the AI to work with but there's massive loss of relevant data that an AI would need to really become proficient in music generation. On the other hand, AIs trained on the raw audio tend to produce somewhat fuzzy audio that often includes what sounds like nearly distinguishable lyrics. I'm personally convinced the latter is the method that will be universally used in the future, but it clearly has a long way to go. So does anyone have any insights regarding why it's straggling a bit?
 Perhaps it's because software like Stable Diffusion are piggybacking off the image recognition advancements that have been in very high demand the past couple decades? Perhaps music is, in fact, a more complicated or more strict artform and our human minds are biased to think that these two tasks should be roughly equivalent in difficulty? It's certainly not due to a lack of data to train on, so maybe we just don't have a model that's really suited to analyzing and imitating music.

Im working on a project with huge amounts of data, actually, the model we are using is xgboost, im trying to increase the performance of my model and I came up with the idea of clusterize my data in an unsupervised way (with out the target in the dataset) and use the clusterization results as a new feature. So I fit several k means (k=3, k= 7, k= 10 and k = 15) to my training dataset and use the clusters as new features to try to improve my xgboost.
 Do you think my approach has sense?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a project where data is naturally and necessarily collected in a row-by-row tabular format. I have a strong suspicious that analysis and exploitation of the data could be revolutionised if it were transposed into a graphDB, but I don't really have any direct experience or good examples to back this up.
 Has anyone here made a similar transition and made some kind of step change in either analysis efficiency or in terms of the value that can be extracted from a dataset?
 I know there are classic examples of where network analysis can be well utilized (social network analysis comes to the top of my mind), but I'd love to hear from anyone with direct industry experience. If it's an unexpected angle, all the better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sylver is an open-source multi-language linter that allows the user to define custom rules by using a small built-in query language (https://docs.sylver.dev/docs/dsl/sylq).
Besides custom linting rules, the user can add support for an entire programming language by using a custom grammar description language. (more info at https://docs.sylver.dev/docs/dsl/meta-lang).
I’m in the process of building a registry of rulesets for different languages so that the tool can also be approached as a traditional linter. The first rulesets for Python are available at https://github.com/sylver-dev/rulesets.
