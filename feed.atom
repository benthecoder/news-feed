        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 For work I need to analyse 52 workbooks with 5 sheets per workbook. I need to add everything into one workbook so that me and my boss can analyse the data.
 The data however is a bit messy. The first two rows contain headers that I need, but the second header needs to be turned into columns to measure the hours spend on something per name. There is also data under the screenshot that is not needed, but that data is in different rows every sheet.
 There are no tables in the sheets, only some visible formatting but no data formatting.
 The screenshot is one example of a sheet from the workbooks i need to analyse. Every sheet contain about 100 rows and 30 columns, but the amount of rows is different for each sheet.
 I've tried analysing with Power Query, then python and started to think about SQL when I couldn't figure it out.
 I'm a bit stuck about making the decision which language to use. If some of you could point me in the right direction I can continue and be on my way. I'm just startin to doubt myself and my method.
 Would you recommend using Python, SQL, Power Query or something different?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been offered to do a full course about just one of this two career paths and when I’m done with the course I’ll also have a job interview so the choice I’ll make it is really important for my future.
 I’m 27 with no degree,I worked last 7 years surrounded by people 8-5 and as an introvert this really drained me out. Also bad company policies and bad work environments gave me the finishing blow. I’m also planning going to university to start studying probably in September.
 I have 0 experience in both Data Science and Cybersecurity,never worked in these fields,all I know from both I learned it from Youtube,Google and Reddit during these days while I’m trying to decide which course I’m gonna choose.
 Final thoughts are: I don’t care much about which job has the best salary,just need money to cover my Uni taxes and survive,so I’d like to decide which job suits me more based on: 1)Which one is more remote oriented? 2)Which one has more self organized schedules/work hours? 3)Which one has less interaction with people? 4)Which one you think has the brightest future?
 Based on this infos about me and most importantly about your personal experiences,which job should i choose? Which one it would be more suited for me and my necessities? PS. Sorry for the broken english.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings everyone.
 I work on a company that builds software solutions for governments. At the data sector, we are processing healthcare data for BI and ML applications. 
 Our current data pipeline looks something like this: Oracle db (data source) -> PostgreSQL db (intermediate db) -> Power BI. This workflow is orchestrated by AirFlow.
 The main issue we are facing is the control of which person can access which database, and the segmentation of said data.
 We would also like to implement a data governance tool. I have been looking into Delta Lake, but it seems this is a tool for data lake house, and not data governance.
 I would like advice on which tools should I look into that can fix the issues mentioned. Also, given our current situation, what would be the next step in order to implement a data governance tool?
 Thanks in advance!!
 Edit: forgot to mention, but this tool also needs to be able to work both on premise and in the cloud.

 I am dealing with an issue that is basically a negative binomial distribution: we are trying to get people to reply to a text message, and we want to see how many days of attempts/reminders it takes before someone replies.
 Someone suggested LSTM as a model, but the examples of LSTM I see are mostly surrounding data that has both upward and downward trends, but what we are dealing with is a series of 0s that end in 1, and that's where we cut the data off.
 Thoughts from the community?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember years ago I spent sometime to learn it as I was curious how a purely functional front-end language feels like, and genuinely thought it had a good chance of being massively adapted in the near future, especially with what seemed like a vibrant community.
However, I got distracted by a data science career and toolchain. Am in the process of starting my first SaaS as a solo founder and was looking at what languages to use and was surprised to see that Elm...seems dead? As an example I did a search on hackernews and it hardly got mentioned in the last year (both comments and posts!)
Am wondering if anyone can provide some more light on what happened to the language? Is it a safe bet? And what is a suitable good replacement for it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have had multiple data science roles and have interviewed several companies. After the initial stages there are usually technical and/or panel interviews. In some cases I am able to determine why based on the interview it didn’t work out but a lot of times I just get a generic email and have to guess why they didn’t move forward.
 I am just wondering based on those who have experience interviewing in those 2nd to 3rd round interviews what are the main reasons you or your company doesn’t move forward.

 And a bunch of you guys stepped up.
 The first video is complete: 24 Data Scientists: If They Started Over
 This is the first of many. I have about 25 hours of content, which I'll turn into about 9 more videos.
 The goal of these videos is to help aspiring data scientists who may be lost and struggling to find the right information that'll actually make an impact.
 Thank you to everyone here on Reddit who contributed. To increase how many times the video is shown on YouTube, please like, comment, and subscribe (it really does help).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Medium.com is still up and running so it hasn't failed exactly, but it's not the best platform to go to anymore when it comes to blogging.
The post quality has deteriorated, and it feels like I'm reading the same posts over and over again. Not to mention the stupid paywall which is infuriating.
Why did Medium end up like this? In the beginning it was pretty good but then it started to wither. Is there any way for a platform like Medium to keep up with high quality posts while also paying their writers well?
Substack has done a good job at competing in the blogging market but it's different from Medium. Medium is more of a social blogging platform while Substack is more of a newsletter platform. Substack doesn't have an algorithm that recommends you content, but instead shows you exactly who you follow. This is nice, but I can't deny that I also like finding new content through a recommendation engine, which Medium also sucks at.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you present business value that you've generated but that isn't quantifiable? This might be a method or script that increases the robustness of a process - but from the outside that improvement can't necessarily be seen. 
 Or it could be a better interface for a colleague who doesn't necessarily work faster (1s time saving makes a lot of difference to the user but maybe not to a business process) but the colleague is way happier because they don't get frustrated by bad UI design. In my mind, this is one example that increases the flexibility of people/processes.
 How do you present such findings, e.g. when in salary negotiations - or when asking for a budget? Or do you not use such qualitative indicators at all?

It includes data cleaning/processing, EDA, hypotheses testing, analysis - usual stuff. The main goal is to find insights and either identify weaknesses in our client MO or prove that they work better than competitors. 
 Thing is, main stakeholder is a non technical non analyst and I don’t have direct access to him. Should I somehow modify my usual approach to creating the notebook, considering that the main audience has no idea how code works and what statistics is? Should I be more verbose and explain more? Any tips and suggestion are welcome, thanks!

 Data engineering for insurnace company £38k many benefits 
 Data science for data consulting company £30k with no real benefits except course certificates 
 I think the data engineering would certainly be a boring role ( but I don’t know) 
 Are there any opinions you guys have as to career progression for both? I’m not sure which one to accept but leaning to the data science one.
 I belive it would provide me with more skills to progress into many more positions, furthermore it’s my understanding that data scientists can go into data engineering in the future, but going from data engineering to data science is much harder as engineering doesn’t require the scientific knowledge. Is there anyone more experience to confirm?

 But how does this work exactly? How is AI punished? Does it feel pain? Is part of its code deleted? How does it feel?
 One such example is a special bot for Minecraft. This bot can do pretty much anything and has a hive mind with all the other bots. It can perfectly navigate through even the toughest terrain and is able to best the best of the best PVPers (weird way to write it I know XD)

This is nothing compared to the top scorer which is currently 0.67 but such a massive win for me. I’m not copying someone else’s notebook, it’s all code that I wrote (by copying code from stackoverflow xD). My goal is to keep improving until the competition ends which is pretty soon. Just wanted to share this as it made my day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN.
Over the last half a year I have been working on a 3D CAD programming language called DSLCAD. Today I am here to show my first release!
It is heavily inspired by OpenSCAD which got me hooked on the idea of a CAD programming language and what it can do.
Please let me know what you think. Ill be in the thread to answer any questions you may have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was experimenting with ChatGPT the other day. I found it impressive but still make subtle mistakes especially in more technical fields. It could definitely trick a layperson, but to an expert it's at times just a bunch of words meshed together that don't make sense. (Interestingly, it is also completely useless when describing video game walkthroughs, like how to find a certain item or access a certain area in a game, which should be very straightforward and unambiguous information.)
 Now let's say AI has a 95% accuracy. Since AI generated content is much easier to produce, there will only be more and more AI generated content on the internet. And since AI is trained from the information on the internet, eventually there will come a point where AI is learning mostly from other AI-generated content. One can imagine that now the AI will only have a 95%*95% accuracy, and so on and so forth.
 Eventually I imagine the accuracy of the information on the internet should deteriorate to a point where an AI like chatgpt is no longer trustworthy (at least in non-academic fields), as well as those AI-generated websites that you already see a lot on the internet.
 Possible/likely? Is there an academic name to this possibility?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The description of this subreddit is "to discuss ds career question" so here's one question for the senior folks of this sub. I'm a Junior /Associate in this field and about to complete my 2 years at a IT consulting startup. Things like very less pay, heavy team politics, unhealthy work environment, employment bond etc are making me quit this company. The question is am I an idiot if I quit my job without having another one lined up and start the job hunt process once I'm on the notice period?
 Why am I taking this route? Many reasons:
  
Employment bond renewal during yearly increment.
 Thee month notice period.
 Need time for interview prep. Bad work life balance does not provide me with enough time.
  
Location: India
 Note: I'm just looking for some guidance and that's about it. Many people here have experienced more years then me in the corporate world or might have experienced something like this. Please feel free to drop in your views.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am the mod for a sub called r/hairlossresearch
 The sub has collected an enormous amount of research on potential treatments for Male Pattern Balding/Androgenetic Alopecia, but all the information remains mostly unstructured and not available in a salient manner for sufferers seeking the appropriate treatment for their age/stage and/or disease subtype.
 I am looking at designing a online decision tree with clickable points to allow you to drill down to finally come to a potential treatment for your circumstances.
 I am seeking suggestions on what website or software I can use to build this clickable decision tree.
 I am thinking of providing an online form, where multiple research supporters can enter a new potential treatment, with details of efficacy, treatment mode, contra-indications, supporting clinical trials, side-effects,etc. 
 Once a new entry is submitted it would populate the decision tree with the new data.
 The reason I am seeking an interface that presents as a clickable decision tree is because the treatment and associated data are so voluminous that a standard tree would be too huge too view on a computer screen.
 Any suggestions on a website or software tool that could work for this?
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently a junior DS in my company (large org, property sector). I joined as an intern earning peanuts after my MS and just got made full time last month. Current package is more livable but well below market average. 
 A couple days ago a recruiter from a company I was targeting post grad (e-commerce/retail) reached out to me. we had a call about an Analyst role opening up and they were interested in my profile. In a nut shell I got the impression that the job was primarily dashboarding. I mentioned I’m currently learning and working on ML problems and that’s what I want to continue doing. So the consensus was that there’s nothing that’s I’d be interested in now but as they build out their BI dept something will eventually pop up. 
 Anyway, my heads been turned. The package they would offer is at least 2x what I’m making now. I saw the job posting in linked in yesterday and to my surprise one of the requirements is experience with ML! 
 I’ve been with my current company for 7 months and it’s not bad but not great either. Boss is hands off, invests in courses and training. But I’m the sole DS in my team and don’t have a mentor. There are other DS in the in different departments, but due to some workplace politics we compete more than we collaborate. 
 So to keep this post short, I see two options: 
 A. Get a year under my belt with my current company and work on personal projects that will help a future application with Company B. 
 B. Call the recruiter back and say I’ve changed my mind after reading the JD and potentially move. 
 I’ve had awkward gaps and lengths in my CV in the past hence my reluctance to leave so early. But since my foots in the door with my ideal company I’m not sure what to do. 
 Any advice or suggestions?
 TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Functional Data Analysis is an emerging branch of statistics, it is in response to the growing advancement in data collection in wearable devices or other data measured over time. the study of high dimensional data,in which the instead of the observations being data points, each observation represents a function in time, wear features can be extracted from smooth functions (derivatives are used as features a lot) or other functional “variants” of classical statistical models ie. (Functional linear model, functional PCA, etc.). The use of functions can be generalized to other types of data, such as imaging, where they estimate higher dimensional surfaces. 
 My question is are there any data scientists out there who do functional data analysis? Or analyzes functional data?
