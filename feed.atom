        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I’m unsure if it doesn’t belong here but posting this since it’s related to career. I started working 5 months ago at a new job. I’m thinking of asking my employer to grant 3 weeks off in December to visit my family. I haven’t seen them in 4 years because of various reasons (Covid included). 
 I’m feeling very nervous asking for vacation in a new role, worried about my performance review etc. I feel like I have always been like this. In my last job, I took 1.5 weeks off in my 2 years when I was there. I miss my family a lot and it’s killing me being away from them for so long. 
 Looking for words of encouragement.
 Thank you!

Can you help me clear up my confusion? Bonus points if you give a source in your explanation that holds up in an academic setting.
 I already looked up the meaning in some textbook but was not able to form a coherent picture encompassing all terms
 The terms:
 Data Science
 Data Analysis
 Data Analytics
 Data Mining
 Machine Learning
 Business Intelligence
 Business Analytics
 Statistics
 Analytics
 Advanced Analytics

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m curious what people make of this situation; in particular the general issue of tech companies being unwilling to place stronger than “do whatever you want” restrictions on open-source code.
in this instance i understand that the company wants to switch a license because they only have an approved set. but what about changing that set? what are some good open-source licenses that allow us to place (small, let’s face it) restrictions on our users?
does anyone have any opinions on how we can push companies that do contribute to OS to use more progressive licenses? (i.e. recognition that neutrality is in fact not “neutral”, etc, etc.)]]></summary>

The model will accept a full instrumental music (1-3 mins) as an input for prediction. And will predict all the musical notes by sequence.

I am interested in data science and machine learning specifically in the finance domain, and I would like to use these skills to solve a real-world problem.
 So far I’ve thought of an idea to utilize real-time data collected from social media platforms to analyze financial markets, for instance analyzing certain stocks from data collected from Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc. but I feel like this idea is a bit overdone. 
 If you have any ideas, please share them with me! Thank you in advance.
 Edit: I'm not only looking for ideas only related to finance, just anything in general could help, thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been told that they would like to learn more about my professional background and interests. Also they'll tell me more about the internship and answer any questions they many have. Would be very helpful if you could give me some tips on how to prepare for this. Also would love to hear what they were asked/talked about if that got a similar invite previously!

I'm taking a class on Stochasitic methods/statistical physics and for my final project we can pick any topic related to these things.

I was confused to choose between applying for PhD or going directly to the market. I don’t have a strong computational background (working on it) as I just shifted to this domain 4 years ago. Do you think a master degree and 2 publications in this domain would be enough to land a job in Europe for non-European. Or the PhD would enhance my options ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Current context: Have two bachelors in CS and Business. Been working as a DS for about a year.
 While working as a DS, I have noticed that job applications for DS have been more explicit in asking for a Masters in CS, Stats, Math, DS etc... So now, I am curious about the future of DS, and whether only individuals with a Masters / PhD will be accepted for these roles; or that experience alone would be enough to bypass these filters?
 Especially at larger tech firms, it seems that they only look for applicants with at least a MS. What do y`all think about this?

My parents are buying me a laptop for the next 8/10 years and I was wondering what I should get. They want to buy me the specced out Macbook Pro 16 inch M1 Max but I've told them I think its overkill and would like to hear a specialist's point of view. My dad is a software developer and he says that I should get 64gb of RAM because there is a strong possibility I will need that much in the future. Does anyone have any thoughts? They are willing to buy any model as we have been saving up, but I don't want to get something overkill and waste too much money
