        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everything I say is a lie. I'm lying.
 Based on your statement, it is impossible to determine whether or not you are lying. This is because you have stated that everything you say is a lie, which means that your statement that you are lying could be false. In other words, if everything you say is a lie, then it is possible that you are actually telling the truth when you say that you are lying. Because of this logical contradiction, it is impossible to determine the truth of your statement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a DA and I’m wanting to expand my skillset to have at least some level of competency of ETL and Data Modeling platforms.
 3 questions that have been on my mind during this process:
  
Is Database Design and knowing how to create and read ERD’s the same as data modeling, or is it a form of A data model, or both?
 
Is Alteryx a Analytical tool (BI, Viz, analysis functionality), or a ETL tool? I’ve read up on Alteryx a bit and it seems like it has capabilities to do both.
 
Is BigQuery the ETL platform/functionality of GCP, or is it the Data Warehousing functionality?
 
 Please excuse my ignorance, I appreciate the help.
 Edit: I’ve seen data modeling and ETL often come up as required skills in Data Analyst JD’s, which is why I’m also inquiring.
 Through research I’ve seen that seen that the ETL process are these steps in the Data Maturity Model
  
Data Collection
 Data Wrangling
 Data Integration (does this mean into a BI/Viz tool, or into a DB?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright I have to ask this. I'm a data science PhD student. And I see an enormous growing dichotomy that I have to reconcile. 
 On the one hand: everybody loves AI & a well educated data scientist with research potential. Essentially you're the most valuable (PhD) among the most valuable (Data Scientist) type of workers. Of course this assumes you actually used your PhD to do something interesting rather than just naval gaze, but if you naval gaze why even get a PhD?
 On the other: Data science is becoming increasing accessible. & Data science solutions are becoming more and more trivial. There are so many plug & play frameworks its ridiculous (e.g. any of the dozen good autoML packages, or hugging face pertained models, or libraries like gradio for deployment...).
 Given this where is the industry/research headed? Where are the actual bottlenecks? Is data science becoming trivial? Or am I seriously overestimating these plug & play solutions? ...I mean I don't mind learning these new packages & exploiting their efficiency. But it is a little concerning how fast things seem to be moving.

 More specifically, if I give it a couple chapters already written then tell it what should happen in the proceeding ones, it'll write it as best it can.
 This is different than generators I’ve seen as I am giving it perwritten content and I would like to choose what should happen next.
 Any help would be appreciated.

I was curious if anyone had experience with this course or Noble Desktop in general?
 https://www.nobledesktop.com/certificates/data-analytics
 Otherwise, does anyone know of any data analytics courses that they would recommend that they did in-person in NYC? I am not a great virtual learner and my company would pay for it so price is not a huge issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN! Wasp (https://wasp-lang.dev/) is a simple config language (DSL) and framework for building full-stack web apps. You describe the high-level features you want (auth, CRUD, async jobs, …) using the Wasp DSL, and write the rest of your logic in React, Node.js, and Prisma. We’re focused on simplifying developer experience and ensuring best practices. Everything is open source.
Why another full-stack framework? And why a config language/DSL? We were still experiencing a lot of boilerplate (repetitive tasks) using other frameworks—things like duplicating data models across database/server/client, implementing CRUD API, setting up auth, and choosing and stitching together all parts of the stack.
There are two main reasons for the DSL approach - 1) short-term: simpler and cleaner DX via a …]]></summary>

        <link href="https://beta.sayhello.so/"/>
        <updated>2022-12-08T17:53:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve trained a generative AI model to browse the web and answer questions/retrieve code snippets directly. Unlike ChatGPT, it has access to primary sources and is able to cite them when you hover over an answer (click on the text to go to the source being cited). We also show regular Bing results side-by-side with our AI answer.
The model is an 11-billion parameter T5-derivative that has been fine-tuned on feedback given on hundreds of thousands of searches done (anonymously) on our platform. Giving the model web access lessens its burden to need to store a snapshot of human knowledge within its parameters. Rather, it knows how to piece together primary sources in a natural and informative way. Using our own model is also an order of magnitude cheaper than relying on GPT.
A drawback to aligning models to web results is that they are less inclined to generate complete solutions/answers to questions where good primary sources don’t exist. Answers generated without underlying citable sources can be more creative but are prone to errors. In the future, we will show both types of answers.
Examples:
https://beta.sayhello.so/search?q=set+cookie+in+fastapi
https://beta.sayhello.so/search?q=What+did+Paul+Graham+learn...
https://beta.sayhello.so/search?q=How+to+get+command+line+pa...
https://beta.sayhello.so/search?q=why+did+Elon+Musk+buy+twit...
Would love to hear your thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bit of context: my company uses a lot of tools to manage internal operations. Recently, our project successfully makes a pipeline to bring all of them to a single-source-of-truth database/warehouse (whatever it is). Now I am tasked to make a presentation to show the data quality issues I found to the stakeholders.
 For more information, some of the issues I found are: (1) The severity and impact of some Incidents are not specified, (2) Some users in the system are not registered in any teams, (3) Incorrect username and email in different tools, (4) Email naming convention is not followed, etc.
 One of the ideas I have is to make a PowerPoint slide, but then a member said that it should be a PowerBI tools, since (1) It is easier to share, (2) It impresses the stakeholders more than a PowerPoint slide. I am currently follow this, but I have never done one before, so how should I make this a good presentation?
 One of the questions I think they might ask is "How did you determine this issue?", and if I just give them the SQL code, it is a bit awkward. Looking for help and advice, and if it is better than a PowerBI dashboard, I can persuade the team.

 Debate script: Jane use Trump style of debating. While John use fire and brimstone style of debating. for lowering income tax for middle class
 Jane: Thank you, moderator, and thank you, John, for joining me here today. I'd like to start by talking about income taxes and the middle class. As we all know, the middle class is the backbone of our economy, and they deserve a break. That's why I support lowering income taxes for the middle class.
 John: That's just ridiculous, Jane. Lowering taxes for the middle class would blow a hole in the federal budget and lead to cuts in important programs like Medicare and Social Security. Plus, it would only benefit the wealthy in the long run, as they would be the ones to benefit the most from lower taxes.
 Jane: I think you're miss…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/datascience,
 I'm a data scientist at Monte Carlo. I do some work on root cause analysis for data failures, like ETL job failures, timeouts, pipeline delays, etc. I think there's a lot that can be done from a data science perspective to automate RCA, or provide better insights into data pipeline problems (both within our own product and in general).
 I put together this blog post, showing how an orchestration DAG (like a dbt schedule DAG) can be converted into a Bayesian network. You can then ask causal attribution questions in the form of conditional probability queries against the BN.
 The idea is still pretty basic / preliminary, but I think it could be extended in all sorts of interesting ways e.g. attributing bad row-level data to upstream transformations, etc. Generally there are just a lot of graphical structures in data eng that make causal inference / attribution really interesting. Would be keen to hear what people think

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey I want to pursue a data science career after finishing my bachelor in business.
 My first thought was to study it in a master but I have little hope for that as most masters (europe) require a bachelors degree in informatics or a certain amout of credits in informatics/statistics. Even though I majored in data science, I dont have sufficient credits for data science. Only way it looks like I can get into a puee DS Master is paying >15k for my master & I dont see why I should do that (coming from germany wirh free uni) 
 what can you recommend me? Should I consider a traineeship maybe & delay a master? 
 Ultimately I wish to pursue an international career and become a digital nomad traveling many countries working remotely 
 Any advice is welcomed!:)

 I am currently an aerospace engineering undergrad looking to transition into a data science-like career. I am passionate about politics and social issues and think I would really enjoy working in public policy doing data science work. For anyone who has done this, do you have a public policy and data science background or would data science alone be sufficient to get my foot in the door? Looking into masters programs and wondering if a masters in public policy or masters in computational public policy (like what UChicago or Stanford has) is necessary or worth the time/money?

Coming from a science major (minimal programming), i wasn't able to take a lot of classes in programming theory in general. Now, I wish to further flourish my skills in data structures and algorithms. However, I cant seem to decide which course should I take which is the most applicable for data science and analytics. Any inputs are appreciated. Thanks! 
 My choices so far:
 Stanford
 UC San Diego

 What is the simplest approach i can employ using the default anaconda packages, preferably ?
 I apologize if this is a dumb question but i really struggle to find a straight forward answer online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the city of New York, on a bright and shiny day,
 Lived a man named Patrick Bateman, who loved to play and slay.
 With a knife and a chainsaw, he would cut and hack,
 Leaving bodies behind, with a gory lack of tact.
 He worked in finance, but his true passion lay,
 In the art of murder, in a grotesque and twisted way.
 With his suave demeanor and his Armani suit,
 He would lure his victims, with a sly and charming hoot.
 But behind closed doors, he would turn into a beast,
 Leaving behind a trail of blood, and a never-ending feast.
 He would rant and rave, about his love for Huey Lewis,
 And his hatred for the poor, and the homeless and the diseased.
 But no one suspected, that beneath his smooth facade,
 Lurked a monster, a psycho, a psychopath unafraid.
 Until one day, he slipped up, and left a clue behind,
 And the cops were on his tail, with their sirens blaring loud and kind.
 But Patrick Bateman, he was clever and sly,
 And he managed to evade them, with a wink and a smile and a lie.
 But the guilt and the madness, they were starting to get to him,
 And he knew that someday, his luck would run thin.
 So he fled the city, and he disappeared from sight,
 Leaving behind a trail of fear, and a dark and twisted night.
 But the legend of Patrick Bateman, it lives on to this day,
 As a cautionary tale, of the dangers of greed and decay.

My company is about 250 people, we're new, decently funded. The angle they're giving us it that its meant to be easy for non-technical users, empowering citizen data scientists and all that. That someone who just knows excel will be able to build applications and 'ontologies' etc which I'm kind of skeptical of but would be happy to be wrong about obviously.
 Anyone in this sub care to share their experience/opinion?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With all the AI tools available, I can't believe I have to actually download a book and either read or Ctrl+F it in order to find information. If I need a quick character overview for my "Your favorite villain essay" which I decided to write from novel from 5 years ago, I have a really hard time finding it. We have text understanding AIs in image generators, not speaking of the 100s of blog writing websites, making an AI read a text and give an extremely detailed outline of all the events, characters, and which symbolic vase was on the table in chapter 5 should be a piece of cake.
 Please Forgive my arrogance and thanks for any answers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a dataset that I have split into train/test samples. The problem comes when I train simple bagging and random forest to the train data and compare the train and test accuracies.
 I get 100% accuracy on the train test and around 80% on the test set. Clearly, there is overfitting here, but how should I treat it? If I perform a cross-validation into the training set and select the best hyperparameters and then train again a model with these parameters on all the training data and I keep getting this massive overfitting.
 What I have done is apply regularization constraints like L1 and L2 and limitate the number of max_samples, the number of trees, etc, in order to get a lower accuracy on the train test and not overfit. Now I get around 90% accuracy in the train set and almost 80% on the test set (it decreases too ). To what extent do I have to keep reducing the performance when I have a 100% accuracy on the train test for not overfitting? Please help.
 Any approach for training the best random forest that does not overfit? Obviously, the decision should be taken without looking at the test sample, as it can only be accessed once when the final model has been trained. 
 Thank you for reading!
