        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past few months, I've seen a lot of conversations regarding the economic downturn and how it affects data professionals, and it resulted in an interview series, Data in a Downturn.
 The first episode features Mark Menatti (Director of Data Science). You can watch here.
 What you'll learn from Mark:
 🎯 How economic downturns have affected data professionals in the past
 🎯 Actionable advice on how to navigate the current economic downturn as a data professional
 🎯 Answers to dozens of audience questions
 Here are some of my favorite questions Mark answered:
 🤔 What was the best decision you took to ensure you could quickly get another job, while working at your existing role? (E.g. projects, networking, etc).
 🤔 When company hiring becomes an internal battle due to limited resources, how do you position new data team hires as essential?
 🤔 How do you scope out analytics projects that yields revenue for the company?
 🤔 Did you do any upskilling while unemployed and how would you recommend individuals stay up-to-date on their skill sets while unemployed? 
 Enjoy

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, all. 
 I’m am heading out of graduate school with a Masters in Earth System Science. I recently interviewed for a data science role that will be focused on building the next gen water model. I have experience in ground validation of models, but I never really learned machine learning or AI. I just did straight statistics, and built some software relating to research using python and C++. I built some useful tools for getting big data and learned a lot about how to clean datasets and prepare them for other people to analyze. 
 That said, I asked for 65-75. When I was on the interview, I asked what the director thought would get. He said he thought I was worth about 85-105. I was kind of dumbfounded, but I’m worried they may cut back as they start looking at what I actually wrote on the application. 
 What would you do in this situation? Should I amend that number in the second interview and just say I’m interested in that range now? Otherwise, I’m a bit worried they may just offer what I wrote on the paper and I’ll undercut myself on what I’m worth. 
 Thanks for any input.

I’m Joe, CTO at Dopt. We’re building a tool that lets you design user state machines and an SDK so that you can run them in your product.
We offer a React SDK that lets you create instances of those machines for any user of your product and exposes methods for transitioning the state of the user—effectively moving them through the machine. Dopt then acts as a persistence layer for the users’ machine state. We call our machines “flows”. Dopt lets you send in data about your users (identify calls/properties) and lets non-devs define rules based on that data for which users should enter the flows. Non-devs can also update content and other custom properties that can be referenced via the SDK.
For example, with Dopt’s SDK you can build:

 Salary is first priority and although actuary has a higher mean income (supposedly) i’ve consistently seen much higher salaries with the MS. It seems like actuary has not kept up with other fields regarding salary and if i’m going to be studying and taking exams for the next decade, why not get the MS instead and get paid the same if not more?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am 42 and have been in technology sales for the last 16+ years. I generally love playing with data and numbers and out of curiosity started learning the basics of data analytics and haven’t found it difficult (so far). I want to seriously learn data analytics / data science (I know these are different but I want to keep my options open). 
 A few things about me:
 - I come from a pure math background (graduated with Mathematics in college) but it's been a while since I had dwelled in that realm.
 - I don’t enjoy coding, not that I can't do it but I am definitely not going to be a master Python or R coder, I know that. I will probably rate myself 4/10.
 - I enjoy statistics, probability and Algebra and don’t mind spending more time understanding the mathematical concepts needed for DS.
 - I also like data visualization, have done a course on Tableau and have been playing around with it. I'd also like to learn PowerBI and Looker.
 I need some help to understand a few things:
  
Am I too old now to venture into the field of DS? Am I already in a losing battle due to my age?
 Although I like working on data visualization projects my end goal is to learn to create various statistical models for predicting various outcomes based on different business / use case scenarios - do I need to be really good in coding to do this?
 How far can my interest in statistics / probability (and the lack of interest in coding) will take me in this field?
 Most importantly, I do not want to restart my career as a Jr. Analyst and climb all the way up at this age. Are there any options where I can leverage my experience in tech sales with the skills I shall acquire in DS?
 Anything else I should know?

Then we could agree on some projects for next meeting and do on our own. Anybody interested? It looks like the grouping would be done in discord or sth. Anybody proficient in that? Also we might also need some experts to provide feedbacks on our projects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do some hiring from time to time in my job, and I wanted to share a simple two-part question I ask data analyst candidates. I've found that it distinguishes between people who have studied vs. practiced their trade.
  
Why would we want to use a median instead of a mean?
 -> Almost everyone has a reasonable answer to this. Most say that medians are robust against outliers. I'll also accept that medians tell you how a "typical" data point behaves.
 Then why don't we just always use a median instead of a mean?
 -> I've seen people really struggle with this one. Even if they understand the math, it's hard to answer this question if you haven't tried to use a median when you shouldn't. The main answer I'm looking for is that the mean is an unbiased (or linear) operator, and then an example of when that matters.
  
Hope this is helpful!

For example, is it possible to move to Klarna, Amazon, Blinklist or Delivery Hero after 2-3 years or do they prefer to hire people who have worked in the same industry or another Tech company? 
 Some tasks I would do in the retail company:
  
Conducting A/B tests (Website, App and Stores)
 
Regression and cluster analyses
 
Exploratory analyses

 Looking to replace a human with an animated character. 
 What options are there as of now?
 I know ebsynth, but it's not too good.
 There is vtuber software, but they look too "anime".
 Looking for something that would give a very "photorealistic" result, think Avatar quality output or a Pixar movie.
 What is the best that's out there right now?

 But now... where do you go, in a society where wealth tends to get sucked upward, to find a good living? Do you learn to roll with being a bot manager? (Assuming the AIs don't just manage themselves?) Do you look for trades of manipulating physical stuff that haven't yet lent themselves to cybernetics?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made it to the interview stage for a business analyst internship. I was disappointed, though, to learn that it would be a one-way interview. In a nutshell, you record yourself responding to various questions given by the hiring company.
 I understand that this is to weed people out, and I have done once previously a one-way interview. However, I made a promise to myself that I would never do an interview in this way again because it screams laziness on the part of the hiring company, and I could spend hours practicing for it only to come up empty-handed. I would even understand if they conducted a technical test of some sort to weed people out.
 Now, should I even bother with this interview?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is really difficult to benchmark Text-to-Image AIs, it relies on so many aspects: speed, styles, precision of the prompt, interface, fine-tuning, etc.
 So I think the best approach is to see which are the most prefered by the people who use Stable Diffusion API.
 Do not hesitate to explain your choice in comments, and also mention APIs that are not in the Poll, I am limited to 6 options...
 I know that I did not put Midjourney, Artbreeder, Stable Diffusion, NightCafe, Crayion, Starry AI and many other but I am interested in those which provide API only.
 PS: this isn't promotional at all, I am not working for any of those companies.

 For the past few years, I have strictly been using jupyter notebook / lab for my python development. This has suited my needs up until now. A project I am working on requires that we write more production ready code, and our advisor strongly recommends we just write python scripts and steer away from Jupyter.
 I’m wondering, does anyone have resources that can help me bridge this knowledge gap? I was hoping to avoid something like a beginners python course, since I already have a good grasp of the basics. Thank you

When data engineers are creating inference pipelines based on the models the data scientists create they shouldn’t have to reverse engineer your feeble code. I am going nuts trying to understand what the nested for loops are trying to accomplish. Just tell me what I need to do to the data and I will do it :)
 I love scrolling through a notebook and looking at the visualizations and pretty pictures though when I’m trying make use of the code in the notebook it is turning the rest of my hair grey.
 Thank you.

 My girlfriend was involved in a Hit & Run with two Ford Explorers.
 She has it recorded on her dash cam, but it was at night and the quality is not high enough to get the plates.
 Can anyone help with where I can find a service that uses AI to enhance the video so we can get the license plate numbers? I clipped the video for just when their license plates are in view here. You can see them both run red lights to flee the scene. 
 Any help would be much appreciated!
 I tried using https://neural.love/, but my video went from 1080p to like 1090p.
