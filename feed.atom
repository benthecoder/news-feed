        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 Over the past couple months, I've been collecting AI tools & generators and decided to put them into a website. The result is SaaS AI Tools, a growing collection of 400+ generative AI tools to help supercharge your creativity and take your business to the next level.
 Also, to differentiate a bit - I've added another section that involves a feed of daily AI articles, so you can keep up-to-date on the top AI headlines. This is how I'm personally keeping up with all the AI stuff today. I'll be adding more tools and news sources soon.
 I've launched the website on Product Hunt and would appreciate any of your support 🙏

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone have a list of data science consulting companies? I'm not particularly interested in market research firms or big data analytics divisions at established firms like the Big Three but rather boutique agencies providing ML/AI solutions to problems unrelated to the business side of things (though perspective on positions at these companies is also appreciated). 
 I thought there would be demand for such agencies, but I'm struggling to find many examples.

Before I was hired, my supervisor promised me that there are plenty of historical data and the company is rolling out new monitoring equipment to collect data. Yet, once I started working on the project, I noticed that either the data is really crappy or the new equipment never works.

 I am faced with some Finance coursework and I would appreciate any help or guidance from experienced practitioners in the ML/Finance industry.
 I have a panel dataset (Data File) - that includes information such as date, stock name, market-cap, sector, and a column for the target variable which is the monthly absolute return of the stock in percentage terms (i.e one month from the date column).
 I am tasked with building a predictive model to forecast the target variable.
 I would like to know information on which ML model you would recommend, and why?
 Thank you in advance for any help or guidance provided.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prior to the ChatGPT release, there were several powerful & similar AI systems already in existence .. but little publicised.
 I wonder if the ChatGPT release was a commercial ploy to beat the (possibly more capable) Google AI systems such as PALM to the market?
 Or maybe the release was intended to break the wall of secrecy hiding AI systems from public view?
 Whatever was behind the release of ChatGPT, at least it may force Google to finally give the public access to their systems too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month I asked[0] what could be done with an old iPad; the responses led me to discover Alfred Home Security[0] and It's exactly what I was looking for. The winning feature being, you can repurpose any old iOS device as a camera.
I have since used the app with 2 old iPads, and an iPhone 7 Plus. Works better than I expect, really nicely done app.
The motion detection is spot-on. I've been mostly using this to see what our new very shy kitten is up to since we've only seen him twice in 5 weeks; basically he's impossible to find during the day and only comes out to play after we're asleep. The videos are super fun / cute, and it's nice to see he's having fun and in good health! [3]
Alfred Security also make a impressive, very inexpensive camera ($34 US, 1080P, night vision, 130 degree viewing angle and easy to mount). I just received 3 of the 4.
TLDR: last month I wanted to know what was the best use for old iPads /iOS devices, and I've since discovered Alfred Home Security[1].
Supported Devices[2]:
Android: Android 4.4 or above (For a better experience, operating systems above Android 5 are highly recommended)
iOS: iOS 10 or above

* I have nothing to do, nor any affiliation with Alfred other than pay for and use their products.
* Original Post is locked; I couldn't post this information there.
* Updated with devices / link, and kitty video link (this is off an old iPad, not the Alfred Camera), and formatting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had a long history of data science at a company that long story short, was absolutely adamant on only reporting and ETL based on Google sheets/excel;
 This basically made me master those tools up to the point where I was connecting API's to Google sheets sending text messages using a Google sheet integration to our customers with order updates based on excel values.
 I was interested in furthering my career by getting into a bootcamp that actually develops my skills with industry tools instead of kiddy stuff like excel/sheets, but without a formal education, has anyone gotten good career success off a bootcamp alone?
 Managers, have you hired anyone who has completed one? Are there any with a reputation you seek/avoid?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i want to make an ai that you can put a prompt into and it makes a minecraft schematic. this sounds easy to me until you really get into the specifics of it. i could train it on a bunch of schematics with their relative names but there wouldnt really be any sense to it.
 For example- if you train it on a bunch of dragons and a bunch of sunglasses, and then tell it to build a dragon with sunglasses, it wouldnt know "where" to put the glasses relative to the dragon.
 ​
 Whats the best way to go about this?

My goal is to eventually transition to a data science role in a couple years. It is my first job out of college after graduating with a BSc in Economics. I didn’t have any relevant jobs or internships in college, so I didn’t really have a clear picture of working as an analyst. Instead, I built a GitHub portfolio during my junior & senior years on top of working various odd jobs.

 I'm not looking for tutorials or specific implementation details - I'm interested in the architectures and types of neural networks which were used to obtain these amazing results.
 Does anybody know a YouTube channel (or something similar) which goes briefly into the core technology of each paper?

 I criticized his decision, and said he should have used a gaussian distribution instead, as the speed of a car (from which the average travel time depends) does depends on a LOT of factors and he started saying i was a troll, despite studies on big cities saying the average speed of a car in a city is around like 5 to 20 km/h at most. Studies he dismissed as "where they come from" (there are a number of articles talking about this theme)
 Was i really a dumb troll as he said? Are there in depth studies about this?

 For the past four-five years I've worked almost exclusively with NLP. I loved it. I joined a company that had some unique corpora and I feel like I really was at the right place. However, my employer seems to recently have changed their strategy and I'm looking for greener pastures. I am not sure if they'll actually fire people but it seems more like they'll gradually make it harder for us to do our work.
 Within two weeks, I got two great offers. Both of them are outside of NLP and both with a decent upgrade in package (let's say 30%). Considering how easy that was (I had like one technical interview total, no leetcode) I wonder if I should look beyond and apply some more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a public institution in a small country in Europe. I figure it’ll take some time until people will hear about it or even try to implement it. I think it’s inevitable though that some day it’ll rule our job market. I’m currently using AI for my own soon to be start-up and also for mundane tasks.
 My question is: Should I tell the board of my company about it? Since I’m on a strategic position of some sorts I think it’ll also be great for my reputation to be the first to kickstart it. However, I’m afraid that by opening this pandora’s box I’ll create more competition by showing other people how to use it. I don’t know, what would you do?

 I'm looking to still have a social life at university and I have heard that actuarial studies exams are very difficult. On top of that, even after completing an actuarial studies degree I heard that there are still exams that must be taken. Does this mean that even after completing my degree, I will be unable to find a decent paying job in comparison to data science in the long run if I choose not to complete any exams? For example if after I complete my actuarial studies degree I will most likely work as a actuarial analyst, is this a better option than becoming a data scientist.…]]></summary>

 I started with a simple task, and there are of course edge cases discovered to be resolved (which real code must address... should the computer click/write/click and write? but these seem to be combinatorial problems.). After all, we don't want to sit there and click... we want our computer to queue us up for Dota!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, I was wondering if there is some sort of tool out there that allows you to have some sort of localised AI - as in it searches all my files, but also within them. Say theres a poerpoint file and one of the slides has some relative content, it will show that slide and not just the file itself.
 I run a consultancy and have 1000s of documents from past campaigns and clients, it would be great to be able to teach some form of AI about my content and then it finds things or creates things when I need it.... 
 thanks!

 Here is a video to the results: https://youtu.be/UNEVlfm0Ync

 Quick notes on the survey: I put it together rather hastely and there are a lot of improvements that could be made.

 In IB I studied Math AA HL (Score: 5) and Physics HL (Score: 7)
 Strengths: - Statistics - Problem solving - Sciences - Writing essays based on physics or mathematics.
 Weaknesses: - Advanced calculus - Creative writing - Coding (Never learnt before)
 From this information could you guys provide any tips?
 Thank you very much.
 Edit: Sorry for the confusion, I am not doing a bachelors of data science but rather a bachelor of science with a major in data science.

This method selected some variables with 80% of zero values, and some turned out to be highly important for the model. Do you guys think this js good for the model? Personaly, I think it's acceptable since I could explain it as the variable helps the model differentiate between those with a value different than 0 and those with 0, but am looking for other opinions
