Using sklearn's GaussianNB model resulted in a rediculously high error rate, in part due to my data being highly imbalanced, so I did a bunch of Googling about how to deal with imbalanced data in particular with regards to Naive Bayes' and I came across an article mentioning sklearn's ComplementNB function being specifically intended for imbalanced data. Looking at the function documentation, it said the same thing. And when I tried using it on my data, sure enough, the error rate decreased significantly. What I don't understand is why. 
 If I understand correctly, the way normal Naive Bayes' works is to assume a prior probability distribution (e.g., the normal distribution), then comput…]]></summary>

I'd be super grateful if anyone could help out.
 Hopefully this doesn't break the sub rules!

 I currently work remotely fulltime as a data scientist (who does little data science) based in Australia. It's a good company with great people, but I think I'm done with meetings and the constant chatter about values, better ways of working and how I'm not spending enough time on my development.
 Past colleagues have reached out to me for contract work. Great hourly pay and fewer hours, so I am tempted. The cons are less super (retirement funds), no accumulated leave, having to continually chase contract work. What other downsides are there with contracting?

 The AI component is interesting as the resulting face (the combination of two people) is not a real person but looks scary accurate. Added benefit - the app lets me create an NFT with the end result! Haven't seen anything like this before ...
 Give it a try, am curious to see where this goes and to hear others' thoughts on the application of AI tech as well.
 I want to see how many people I can mash faces with so mash your face with mine here!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello :)
 I'm starting a YouTube channel focused on helping new learners break into the data science field. 
 I'm sure someone has helped you on your journey (a friend, professor, mentor, etc). Sadly, some people have nobody...I'm making these videos for them.
 The premise of the channel is simple. I'm asking 100 data scientists questions about their journey (tips, mistakes, challenges, etc) and then turning those questions into YouTube videos. 
 Here's an example: "100 Data Scientists Reveal Common Newbie Mistakes" OR "100 Data Scientists Share Their #1 Interview Tip"
 There's a lot of data science-related content out there, but there's nothing like this.
 Many new learners are lost and could really use your help. So if you're a data scientist and have 20-30 minutes to spare, I'd love to ask you a few questions via a Zoom call. 
 Thanks so much!
 p.s. When I say 100, I really mean it. I have roughly 17 interviews scheduled this last week by reaching out to people on LinkedIn. But I still got a ways to go! So if you know anybody you think would love to help, please share this with them!
 p.p.s I will also be interviewing data engineers and data analysts, but I won't be doing those for another few months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This has been a reoccurring problem that Engineering will make slight changes to table names, change tables all together or make other updates that disrupts analytics and makes our dashboards fail.
 These changes makes sense that they are doing, but we never learn about them until something fails and other point it out or we get errors on our own queries investigating something/doing analysis.
 When I asked the head of engineering about this, he told me that engineering is moving so fast and that they dont want to create a manual system to update analytics after every change. That this is not scalable and we should find another way.
 Has anyone else been confronted with this? How do you handle in changing environment issues like this. And for reference, I work for a small-mid size company (200 people)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Honestly questions like this have probably been asked a million times here but here goes:
 I study economics at a university abroad, not important which but I am an American citizen. I want to transition to a more tech and date centric role when I graduate. I was thinking about doing a master’s in business analytics but thats not a sure thing. So for now I’m going to try to brave the completely foreign world that is Data Science. I started with Python and I got a membership to Data Camp which seems to have some pretty well-rounded courses. But like most online courses, I’m sure it does quite little for getting a job.
 My question is, how do I stand out among the pool of engineers, and highly experienced workers. Is there something you started doing early to give you an edge? Do you have any advice for someone who still currently is quite overwhelmed with the task ahead?

However, I need advise on how to make and give a data presentation when you get the data a hour before the presentation and then immediately have to give it. There's very little time to dig into the data and really understand it, draw conclusions, make a presentation, and practice. Surface level descriptive stats aren't going to impress here. What advice does r/DataScience have?

I was recently given the choice to transition to data taxonomies. I want to land a entry DS or BI job, but without having a degree until next year I know that will be hard. Especially because I only have basic python knowledge (As a marketing analyst we use SPSS instead of python). 
 Would moving into data taxonomies for 12 months while I finish up my degree be at all helpful to my DS job search, or would employers not view taxonomies as relevant experience?

 Because I see people say it’s possible without a college degree. 
 Did you succeed starting from scratch? Assuming you already had the talent and willingness to work hard?
 If yes, how did you do it and how is it going?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me explain what I mean by the title.
 I’m currently working as a Data Analyst (UK based) in industry, in a completely different field/subject to what I did at university (I studied Physics, then completed my PhD in Physics looking at spacecraft data). This is my first full time job and I’ve only been in it for about 10 months.
 Because of this, you could say I have no “formal” training as a data analyst/scientist, but that’s fine because I’ve got plenty of experience and a quantitative background.
 Now, in my industry, I work with a range of datasets associated with different topics and subject areas. Because of this, despite me having the transferable technical skills to be able to break down and analyse the data, and communicate with stakeholders, my knowledge of the subjects themselves is quite weak compared to the people I provide the analysis for (the “subject matter experts”), because I’m constantly dipping in and out of different projects and datasets.
 I’m just wondering if that’s what I’m in for in my career as a data analyst/scientist? I.e. despite having the technical skills and expertise, never specialising in a specific subject/dataset.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now I work as a Senior Data Science Analyst. My schooling was a little weird, but basically I had to supplement my degree with a lot of extra learning (books, Udemy, Youtube, projects) to even get a job as a Support Analyst at a tech company, move over to Data Analyst, interview elsewhere, and get the job I have now. Between grinding at that, and school, I spent 3-4 years going hard at learning, but it was always the “basics”. Right now I’d say I’m really good at SQL, proficient at Python/R for basic analysis, and pretty good at Tableau.
 The role I’m in now has shifted recently to be very administrative. Without getting into too much detail, the company I accepted a job with earlier this year had some data issues, so I have spent a lot of time emailing people, in meetings, updating their database, and working in Excel. I feel like I’m losing my skills, so I want to work on projects or courses or books outside of work, to stay sharp.
 The problem is, my job is boring. I don’t like it, but it’s a lot of busy work, so I’m burning out fast. The day ends and I don’t want to sit and learn and code, I want to have dinner, walk my dog, and watch TV or see friends or play video games. I just don’t have it in me right now to do more, let alone keep up the skills I feel slipping away.
 What do you guys do in this case? Has anyone been in my shoes, and been able to get excited about learning after work?

 I was told to forecast the next 5 years with only 6-8 months of data
 so I (25 M) worked as a data scientist, and been stucked for 2 months cause my user asled me to forecast next 5 years of satelite traffic amount with only, max, 6-8 months of data. I have been wandering around, asking people, which was returned by surprise and laughter, and yet still clueless of how should I conduct this project. I'ce tried it all like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Regression, Holt Winter, ARIMA, SARIMA(2,3,4,6,12,30 Seasonality), and yet none of it is up to my users satisfaction. The best one, so far, is auto_arima, and yet the user argued that it isn't good for daily data, like NU UH! THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY ARTICLES OUT THERE SAYING THAT ARIMA FAMILY IS THE BEST FOR TIME SERIES, NOT TO MENTION DAILY DATA.
 Really guys, I may be a noob, but this really got to my nerve real bad. It's a contract based of one year, and I'm still 3 months going. Any Data Scientist grand master here eho could enlighten me on how to get this done? Appreciate tho

 I'll be brief. 
 I'm a SaaS salesperson (2 yoe) and a arketing post graduate. Thought I needed to switch career & as I was always curious about data analytics, I joined a digital course to learn data science in a structured way. 
 So my question is, how could I combine my sales + marketing background with data science? 
 What are the career opportunities out there? 
 P.S: Got good presentation skills. If that can also be included, the better. 
 Good day😄

Patterns gets rid of repetitive gruntwork when building and deploying data applications. We abstract away the micro-management of compute, storage, orchestration, and visualization, letting you focus on your specific app’s logic. Our goal is to give you a 10x productivity boost when building these things. Basically, we’re Heroku for AI apps. There’s a demo video here: https://www.patterns.app/videos/homepage/demo4k.mp4.
Our target audience are data engineers and scientists who feel limited by Jupyter notebooks and frustrated with Airflow. They're stitching together business apps (e.g. CRMs or email marketing tools), AI models, and building proprietary automations and analytics in between them (e.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work as a software engineer, and my brother works as a data scientist, and neither of us can land a single interview. We were talking about the job market during Thanksgiving last week and we both can't seem to get any interviews after hundreds of applications. Always auto rejected by the ATS systems/HR. Every job we apply for, same story. Within 1-2 weeks, we always receive an auto rejection email. We both looked at each other's resume's and our resume's clearly list our extensive experience and it's not a resume issue. I have a Master's Degree in CS and my brother has a PhD in CS. I work as a Staff Software Engineer and my brother works as a Principal Data Scientist and we can't get interviews. It makes no sense. I have worked in software development for nearly 10 years, and my brother a data scientist for over 6 years. We are both still employed but looking for a change. And the kicker: My brother has published research on Convolutional Neural Networks for medical device applications and went to CalTech (a very top tier school on the scale of MIT/Harvard if you don't live in the US) for his Master's/PhD and he can't even get an interview. Is there a mass hiring freeze going on across the industry? What's the deal? We both feel like we are sending our resumes into the abyss and they aren't even getting seen.

I understand that since D = 0, we don't perform seasonal differencing. Does this mean my data has something related to seasonality (because P = 2 and Q = 1) or not?
 What would be the best way to explain the orders and seasonal orders of the ARIMA parameters above in a way that non-technical managers can also understand?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! I am a Msc Data Science graduate but unfortunately the course didn't really teach me a lot and all I did was learn a whole lot of how to make assignments (kinda regret doing it).
 As the title suggests, I am trying to learn IT skills to set my foot into data science/engineering jobs. What is a "fail-proof" IT skillset I would have that will almost guarantee that I will "most probably" land a job?
 Current IT skills I possess: 1) Excel - intermediate to advanced 2) PowerBI - intermediate to advanced 3) Sql - intermediate to advanced 4) Python - basic level. (Mentioned intermediate before but I don't believe I am anywhere near intermediate competency in python). All I can do is make stupid turtle games :)
 Also I can never understand the difference between python and python for data science. Is modules/libs being used the only difference? I have started to learn coding and can do easy level questions on hacker rank with relative ease.
 I want to upskill myself with any skills that will be needed in next 2-3 months to go after a Junior DE/DS position.

Jasper, an Austin-based start-up, recently raised $125 million in Series A funding at a $1.5 billion valuation. London-based Stability AI also raised $101 million in an oversubscribed round, with investors like Coatue and Lightspeed Venture Partners participating. In May, Hugging Face also raised $100 million in a Series C round at a valuation of $2 billion. 
 The backing from big is another stamp of approval for generative AI start-ups. Microsoft has made significant investments in OpenAI and is anticipated to enhance its OpenAI efforts this year. Additionally, Google and Meta developed a new artificial intelligence tool to produce a video from a simple text prompt. Such interest from big tech could also very well spark a wave of M&A in the generative AI space. 
 Even if generative AI output can’t yet match the human-generated output, businesses and creators see them as handy tools in a broader toolbox. Further, a large number of firms are using generative AI to improve efficiencies and speed in their operations, providing value for their customers. That said, businesses need to address ethical concerns, which are often associated with AI.

 This is a new team full of 15ish people who mostly have not worked together. I’d like some way to display (to myself and the team) what people are working on and how each person’s contributions intersect. Ideally this would look like some kind of Trello-meets-flowchart where I can see what’s going on, what resources are in play and how it all relates.
 Does this exist? What are best practices you guys have seen for getting a big picture overview of the mechanics/assets in play with your team?
