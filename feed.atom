        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all!
 I'm excited to release AutoPlot, a tool I built to tackle the question: what if you could do any data analysis by just speaking in natural language?
 No confusing scripts, Excel macros, or Matplotlib incantations.
 AutoPlot allows you to explore the limits of next generation human interfaces for visually understanding data.
 Here's how it works: I've provided a few datasets you can analyze out-of-the-box such as Wine, Hurricanes, and Titanic. Select one of the datasets to see a preview of its contents including its schema. When you are ready to do some visual analysis, simply provide a natural language description of what you want AutoPlot to do.
 I look forward to hearing your questions/feedback.
 Hope you find it fun!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm not a data scientist, I just want to ask for your help/advice, since I figured you guys might be good at solving this kind of problems.
 My goal is to write a program that can find associations between random words.
 Like if I give it a word "cat" and a word "dog", I want it to be able to return me the words like "fur", "tail", "pet", "mammal" - all the things these two words have in common.
 I want it to work even for words that don't have a lot in common, or find associations that aren't obvious. Actually, that would be the main purpose of this model.
 So if I give it two words like "baby" and "onion", I want it to output words like "crying" (since both babies and onions are associated with crying). Or "cake" and "cow" would both output "food".
 Do you think that's possible to do? How would you approach this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like the title says, I was wondering about creating a story where an AI would serve as the Supreme Court in a future America since a human court is so extremely divisive. The thing I'm struggling with is trying to figure out how to describe or frame the AI and how a world could have been molded to accept the judgement of an AI in place of a court that has always been served by humans. 
 Does anyone have any thoughts or ideas what an AI like this could like? What kind of thinking would it have? What would its framework and basis be to determining the validity of law? Could it actually interpret passed the written letter of the law? Even though is in a future America (probably over ~100 years into the future), what kind of dissent would exist against it? 
 Any and all input would be greatly appreciated. Also, any resources to be pointed to, more on the AI philosophy stuff would be great too. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I'm looking for some Data Analyst starting advice.
 I have an MPH in Epidemiology/Biostatistics from 20 years ago that I haven't used much. I have a administrative analyst job where I have a small limited data project. With this small project, I've used a little bit of SQL to manipulate the data with it and I'll start putting together a simple report with Power BI next. I feel way more comfortable using Excel. I know how to do lookup tables and formulas from before, but not pivot tables yet(hopefully this week). I've started doing some studying to brush up on potential statistics questions in interviews. I plan to try to take a course on Python also. I'm going to try to put together a portfolio of some work online. 
 I want to become a Data Scientist eventually and starting as a Data Analyst seems like a good way to get my foot in the door. 
  
I'm wondering how difficult will it be for me to get a Data Analyst job? I've read anecdotally that hiring is slowing down at the moment.
 Should I focus on larger companies or smaller companies? 
 Any other advice on what I can do to improve my chances of getting a Data Analyst job?
  
Thank you for any advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey couple of my colleague want to show my internal Datascience dashboards/maps/html to some clients outside our organization.
 Is there any zero config login gateway from one of the modern hosting providers such as cloudflare,digital ocean, vercel etc that would abstract away this?
 I'm just a python data guy on a small team and we don't have the resources for webapp dev/ops let alone someone for saml/sso/id.
 ​
 Hopefully there is any easy from my fellow DSers
 Ideally a id gateway infront of the Floating IPs (now named Reserved IPs). A Floating IP is an IP address that can be instantly moved from one Droplet to another Droplet in the same datacenter. This way i can destroy and create different prototype dashboards and not deal with sso each time. :S

 A week after submitting, the recruiter got back to me asking for an updated submission with more data included in my query, additional features added, model tuning, etc. I spent an additional 10+ hours on this portion and threw everything I had at it.
 I don't mind spending the time as it's a position I really want at a great company, I am just curious to hear what other people are doing and if this is a normal amount of time to spend on an assignment.

 CROWDLAB produces a consensus label, confidence, and annotator score for data labeled by multiple annotators.
 After many long nights, I'm psyched to share the new easy-to-use and effective CROWDLAB algorithm that can use any classifier to estimate:
  
A consensus label for each example that aggregates the individual annotations. 
 more accurate than aggregation via majority-vote and common crowd-sourcing algorithms
 
 A quality score for each consensus label which measures the confidence that the consensus is correct.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Where have people been and how was it? I'd like to stay within Europe, due to financial constraints.
 I have a strong interest in topics across the field (so as well as ML, things like Multi-Agent Systems(!), Ethics, Neural Networks, evolutionary/bio-computing) and would like something that isn't mainly ML. I'm thinking of doing a Master's at King's in London since the course seems well-rounded, but I've talked to someone who did the course and they feel that half the courses are lazily taught and lack depth (lectures that barely cover a topic, no practicals, tutorials without many questions, teaching only narrow parts of a field).
 I'm aware UvA is popular, but it's a two year course. Leuven's on my shortlist in particular (the modules look great: link) but I've since found someone on here complaining about more or less the same thing as KCL - many lazily taught courses, no practicals, etc. so now I'm not sure..
 I'm aware no course is going to be perfect and that you get out what you put in, but it'd be nice if the courses were somewhat detailed. Where did you go and what was your experience?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For me, it was two moments:
 1) Not every project required ML or deep learning, and that jobs focusing on that require a PhD and much more experience than I had as a new grad with an MS. You can almost forget about getting an ML research-oriented data science position with anything less than a PhD since most data science jobs value simpler approaches over the complex, and the other types of positions are in fact data analyst positions.
 2) Data engineering is a much bigger part of the job than I thought. I was pleasantly surprised to see how much I enjoyed this part of the job, to the point where I got a data engineering position under a data group that was more engineering-focused.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking at sports rankings for major tournaments throughout a 20 year period. Teams have a ranking, however, the method of ranking has changed quite often, so you cannot compare Tournament 1 ranks to Tournament 2. In order to get around this I decided to make each ranking relative to the highest ranked team for that tournament. However, this is squashing the rankings when the best team has a much higher rank than the rest/right-tailed. 
 Should I log transform the data or is there a better way to normalise the data rather than using relative ranks?
 Or should I leave the data as is, arguably if one team is very far ahead of the rest then the tournament is less competitive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before we talk about replacement, let us try to understand the real value of a good programmer. A good programmer’s value is not merely knowing "how to code." Programmers bring value by understanding "what to code."
 Simply put, they need to understand the business value of each requirement to be built and decide and prioritize their development based on the criticality. In a nutshell, they have fully functional "thinking" human brains.
 And the AI we see today is data-based. Yes, it can do things like categorizing images on Google, reading license plates, powering the routines of Alexa and Siri, and even using highly sophisticated methods of classifying data and recognizing patterns.
 But it cannot think like a human brain. For AI systems to be capable of 'thinking,' they need to be continually trained and fed with giant data banks covering every possible human scenario. This is not 100% possible.
 That is why AI can write code but can't ensure that it has written the correct code. It cannot understand the business value of features. It cannot refactor an old, buggy code and cannot decide whether to remove a piece of code or not.
 So, the future of software development and AI is collaboration and integration. AI will help programmers redefine programming by taking over tedious, repetitive tasks so that programmers can focus on building something great.
 Programmers can also pair with AI to write better software and reduce development lifecycle times. And far from replacing programmers, AI is becoming ready to reimagine a programmer’s workload through integration and enhanced efficiency.
 Here are five benefits of using AI in software development:
  
AI can validate project requirements
 Automatic debugging
 Automatic testing
 AI can make programmers more efficient
 AI will change software development

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new competition has just opened for registration by the United Nations, which will run in parallel to G20 in Indonesia but is open to all to participate remotely too. It will run from 8-11 of November, but pre-registration is required for individuals or teams up to 3.
 The competition differs from the typical Kaggle / DrivenData competitions because it focuses on the use of Privacy Enhancing Technologies to access and learn from the data. Taking part, you will interact with secure enclaves, differential privacy and synthetic data and become familiar with some of the leading privacy data science libraries like OpenDP (Harvard), SmartNoise (Microsoft) and DiffPrivLib (IBM Research). 
 There are also going to be a number of venues around the world where you can join in in-person and meet like-minded data scientists. The first location announcement was Harvard's John A. Paulson School Of Engineering And Applied Sciences for those in the Greater Boston Area. 
 There will also be webinars and Q&A ahead of time with the lead developers of each of the prominent frameworks. 
 For more information and registration: https://petlab.officialstatistics.org/ 
 If you would like to host an in-person location at a university or public space, reach out to [mira@oblivious.ai](mailto:mira@oblivious.ai), and there is support to help you run it successfully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta has just released AIT, an inference system for AMD and NVIDIA GPU hardware that claims to provide excellent inference performance.
 AITemplate transforms AI models into high-performance CUDA/HIP C++ code. It performs various graph transformations and optimizes execution time with new C++ kernel templates for the GPU target, while maintaining a minimal dependency on external libraries CUDA/ROCm.
 https://github.com/facebookincubator/AITemplate
 This is a really promising project intended to be an alternative to TensorRT and other inference tools. As maintainers of the opensource nebullvm inference accelerator, I am very eager to see the performance of AIT compared to other inference tools. We are working on integrating AIT in nebullvm so that users can test AIT, TensorRT, ONNX Runtime and other state-of-the-art inference optimizers to see which one provides the best performance for your model and hardware.
 Kudos Meta!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I am junior data scientist with computer science background, currently working in financial data science. Most of the time I do descriptive analyses with my team on tabular data with a goal to find where models can be useful. I also worked with scrapers, models and modeling pipelines a little bit. My boss told my team that we have budget for self development, so he encouraged us to use this funding for something useful for us, so I am looking for any relevant courses. I checked courses on coursera and they seem to be more entry level. I already had MLops course from coursera which I liked since it covered a lot of things we could possibly apply in the future. Tbh I have a feeling that I can get more knowledge from reading articles and relevant books and doing small projects, but funding has to be used, so. Do you have any interesting recommendations? Now I am considering to take something from Andrew Ng classic, since we don't have a need to use any neural nets on tabular data and I start forgetting things. I also have a feeling that I don't know statistics as well as I supposed to, but I am not sure there are any online courses which cover more than the average course in my uni. Last option is some cloud certifications, but we don't have anything in clouds by now and I am not sure if I need it currently.

 I was recently wondering whether I could use more relaxed phases at work to contribute to a certain cause. One I set my eyes on is human trafficking, but I suspect it requires heavier intelligence type of work, where familiarity is key (though I have experience with that), and less an occasional data analysis project. In case of any relevance - I’m living in Europe, but happy to look at any opportunity that has no issue with remote work.
