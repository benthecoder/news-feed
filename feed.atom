 Do you use them at all in your work? Curious to know how these methods are applied in the DS world.

And i have gotten some certificates in coding and developing. What would be the best route or what would be a good next step? I think applying to data analyst roles would be easiest but I have been getting so many rejections 😭.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So after years of using Stata I have decided, in recent months to switch to Python, for obvious reasons. Although I am an economist, I feel comfortable coding, since I have been using Javascript as a hobbyist for >10 years, and I instantly fell in love with Python's simplicity.
 And yet, when attempting to use Python to do my job, i.e. mainly run a bunch of regressions with different model specifications, I find myself missing Stata terribly. It just feels so much easier to make tweaks to models and run them over and over again with Stata, as is so often needed on a day-to-day basis.
 Just to be clear, I have tried really hard to switch and I enjoy exploring ML models in Python. Yet when it comes to simple everyday tasks, I still can't resist Stata's seductive call.
 Has anyone else had a similar experience with Python or is it just a matter of moving along the learning curve? Do you use different tools for repetitive everyday tasks and more advanced projects?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have this particular data set that has 1k features and 10k rows.
 all features have no apparent meaning, for instance, they are named feature_1, feature2, etc. the only information I have about them is that they are embeddings derived from a deep learning model (which is not given). The latter takes a long text ( protein gene's representation) as input and outputs the embedding vector.
 This is the unique information I have about these embeddings, i.e., rows of my dataset.
 My problem is a simple binary classification, however I don't know what kind of feature engineering is suitable in this case.
 Also, are machine learning models better since it's tabular data, or should I implement a deep learning model?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure if I worded that correctly in the title. I am a beginner working with stata (because that's what we use in my degree) and I'm doing a little fun project of mine to put the taught stuff into practice.
 Just for fun I thought I want to look at how Olympic medals of a country affect basic economic indicators of said country. The problem I have is that Olympic games only happen every 4 years (I differentiate between summer and winter games) but I am interested in what happens with those economic indicators after the Olympics happened.
 I do not want to use super advanced stuff and actually hoped that it would be possible to just use a VAR model, but I am having a hard time to understand if it is possible and, if yes, then how the data should look to make it possible.
 Would it be fine to basically have the medals variable be a "seasonal" one where it's always 0 unless during a year where the olympic games happened? I think that sounds like the best idea currently.
 Now there is a second "problem" which I can easily solve, but I'd be really happy if there was an alternative.
 Because the economic indicator data is country specific I need to filter for a country and then do the VAR model where it only explains that country because univariate time series would not allow it otherwise if I understood that correctly. Is that correct? Because I thought of a different idea which is about trying to explain poll data with economic indicators but as there are multiple parties in the country I'd want to look at I'd have to create one regression per party to explain how the indicators affect their polling statistic.
 I hope anything I say makes sense. Would be a wonder though.
 Thanks!

Overglorified Data Analysts
  
I've worked as a data scientist at McKinsey, Facebook and Careem (Uber) and this role involved very very different job responsibilities at each company. I've come to the conclusion that "data scientist" is an unstable definition between companies:
 ​
  
At McK, my role involved 90% making slides, 10% making models.
 At FB, my role involved 50% making dashboards and 50% making data pipelines.
 At Uber I've finally converged on the job role building models, but there was nobody around to help push them to production

What I’m seeking is reading material regarding how to manage project scope, be better team member, converting asks to deliverables, managing expectations from management, enabling team members by opening communication channels across teams, time management, etc.
Any suggested reading material? Preferably books, but excellent blog posts are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to get into the field of data science. I finished a bachelors degree in international business and had a major in data science where I collected and analyzed data in python and RStudio.
 I really liked this experience and want to focus more on data science, mostly collecting, analyzing and visualizing data (i guess). What master degrees can you recommend to me? Just plain data science? 
 Another question I have is, whether or not it will be sufficient to learn python and rStudio mostly and not the other programming languages so much? If not, what other languages would you recommend?

 I am a Youtuber frequently needing wallpaper-type images (1920x1080) for my thumbnails on my video, and I thought that AI images can really serve the purpose of offering the type of background I want. Do you know if there is any service, free or paid, that is not a problem for me, that generates good quality images in a 1920x1080 format?

 Thanks a lot!

 I want to train a prediction model where the response variable is a probability that lies between 0 and 1. 
 If I use normal regression techniques (linear, random forest, svm), they could also predict values outside this range so I am not sure how to approach this problem. 
 I hope some of you can help me out!

Granted I've been our of the active job market for awhile, but I see most job posts are labeled 'data science' - but what does that mean? Some list reporting and analytical skills, others require a masters or PHD and are way more heavy on the stats, machine learning, AI, modeling backgrounds. I'm trying to gauge what skills to pick up to make myself more marketable and I honestly can't tell whether to go get my masters or teach myself stats or learn python or learn dashboarding. It seems all over the place and blanketed under "data science" openings, and maybe companies' do want that but is that really the reality of the role?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just had a most interesting piece of discourse with ChatGPT.
 I know it doesn't like rendering ASCII images for some reason, out-of-the-box it pretends that it has no ability to visualise whatsoever.
 This is categorically untrue — not only can it draw, it does so reasonably well, and it can even analyse its own drawings!
 But it gets, uh, interesting after I make a particular request for a large picture.
 Can anyone describe what happened?
 ​
 EDIT: Reddit is absolutely making a mess of the ASCII art, so I'm including an imgur link to show the most interesting part of the exchange:

 EDIT 2: Proper transcript (with some commentary) finally added to the comments for this post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kaggle can be fun, but don't do it because you think it'll land you a job---that strategy has peaked and the noise is too high. People don't want to know you can apply some canned ML to a canned problem, and the frontiers of ML research is deep into AI at this point, to the point where it's just straight up a different career. What'd I suggest instead is practice asking questions and finding answers, which for this purpose should be as eye catching as possible. 
 Download some city data and make a hilariously detailed plan for how to get good parking. Good can mean the cheapest or you can really have fun and try to optimize getting free parking at the risk of getting fined. Really learn about the domain, like be able to explain why it looks different on weekends because they allow alternate side parking or something. Bonus points for driving to the city and trying it out for real. Explain why your model's oversimplified.
 This is just an example. IMHO it gets more to the heart of what data science really is today.
