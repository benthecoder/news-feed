        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve got 8 years of accounting/audit experience and am currently pursuing my CPA. I realized I don’t wanna keep going down this path of the public acctg world and want to become a data scientist. I feel like I have a knack for pattern recognition and would love to apply my intuition more in an exciting field like DS. I’m planning on doing OMSA at Georgia Tech. Can anyone give me some advice?

 Or is it just me lol.

I have a seasonal business that I own and operate for 5-6 months (indoor golf simulator). Im looking to put my new skills to use during the summer months when the indoor golf facility is closed. Obviously a full time position would be hard as Im full time in the winter. While I dont need the extra income, I have the time and would be beneficial to pick up some kind of side work to earn some more.
 Mainly looking for advice for either some kind of freelance or gig work that I can pick up when I have time to make a little extra as a beginner to build some experience. Thanks in advance for any advice

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking at some Kaggle resources and many high ranking participants offhandedly say that an important part of doing well is designing good model validation. However, I'm a bit confused as to how to discern a "good" way to validate a model from a way that is a little "less good". For the sake of this post lets only consider different types of cross validation strategies.
 ​
 As far as I understand the purpose of model validation is to provide some sort of estimate for the expected prediction error when the model is asked to predict on unseen data. I think I also understand that a "good" validation strategy should be one where the folds that you're training and testing on have a distribution similar to the data and respect certain properties of data. For example, for a time series you would not use random k-fold cross validation but you would rather make splits where you train on some time window and predict on a future window. The difference here is clear cut.
 However, suppose for a particular time series problem one has several candidates as to how to perform cross validation on a time series in a way that respects the time aspect and also attempts to capture other aspects of the data distribution. How would one test whether one of these cross validation strategies is better than another? Does one select the validation strategy that has the most stable predictions on the hold out folds? Does one keep another hold out set and compare the errors on the holdout folds to the error on the hold out set and then pick the validation strategy with the least discrepancy? Furthermore, it seems like designing a validation strategy is a step taken before modeling actually starts so are they evaluated by just some sort of baseline model? Appreciate if anybody could shed some light on this.

 a blurb from their company site
 Quantum Engine is dedicated to building the foundation for the future of immersive entertainment crafted through advanced artificial intelligence technology. Our ultimate vision is to empower individuals to become any character and exist in an endless, open-world narrative that unfolds based on the interactions in a scene. We invite you to experience our beta demo, readily accessible at https://quantum-engine.ai/
 Drawing inspiration from The Matrix film, the Quantum Engine demo allows for a unique conversational experience with the character, Morpheus, in the iconic “Construct” scene that evolves in real-time. Available in over 30 languages, with the capability of conversing in 6 languages (English, Chinese, French, Japanese, German, and Spanish), the potential opportunities for interaction are limitless. Additionally, the ability to spawn objects within the Construct using only voice commands, such as "Spawn an [object] in the construct" or "Give me an [object] in the construct." The ability to generate objects in real time provides a glimpse into the long-term vision of bringing a scene to life in real-time.
 In the upcoming release, we will introduce the ability for anyone to upload their own scripts, allowing Quantum Engine to generate a personalized experience for your favorite movie, show, or game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I have a CSV with around 2k rows. Each row contains a unique ID which is broken apart by the columns.
 If we liken the data to in the CSV to be for example products in a shop (it isn't but I am trying to generalise so not to give away specific work information), you could think the columns describe the products a bit like this:
  
 product_id color size weight avg_time_between_sales number_sold_ly 
  
 ​
 Normally, to analyse this data, I would sit there and create loads of different pivot tables and graphs to try and slice and dice this data in loads of ways to come up with insights, however I have up to 12 different columns per product_id, and some things I might want combine columns to look at (E.g instead of looking at number sold for just red products, maybe number sold for red products between 0-5kg and red products between 5 - 10kg).
 ​
 I was wondering if there was some sort of machine learning model or data science tool that would essentially let me input my CSV and then automatically perform a variety of correlation tests etc to start showing me insights. Does something like this exist?
 ​
 If it helps, I can use Python well and so really I'm looking for the modules and maybe some documentation that lets me plug and play.
 Thanks everyone

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got about 10 CSV's totalling 4.6 GB -
 I initially tried processing it in chunks in Python - it ran very slow - took about 10-15 minutes to return a really straightforward aggregation.
 I then needed to perform an average based on the aggregation and it ran for about 60 minutes until I forced quit.
 I have now moved over to setting up an Azure SQL server - but the set up is taking forever - are there any alternatives/is my Python code just really poor and processing and aggregating 43m rows of csv data shouldn't take more than 60 seconds if done correctly?
 My code writes the group by for each chunk which definitely isn't intended, but surely that isn't the cause for an additional 14 minutes or so of processing?
 How would you tackle this problem - should I stick with the Azure set up, fix my python code or try an alternative?
 ​
 def datepassfail(): #issue with duplicating the group by for each chunk import os import pandas as pd # specify the directory containing the CSV files directory = 'dft_test_result_2021/test_result_2022' results = pd.DataFrame() for filename in os.listdir(directory): # check if the file is a CSV file if filename.endswith('.csv'): file_path = os.path.join(directory, filename) for chunk in pd.read_csv(file_path, usecols=['test_result', 'make'], chunksize=1000): chunk_result = chunk.groupby(['make']).test_result.value_counts().unstack() chunk_result = chunk_result.rename(columns={'F': 'F_count', 'P': 'P_count'}).reset_index() results = pd.concat([results, chunk_result]) # save the results to a new CSV file results.to_csv('dft_test_result_2021/test_result_2022/output/test_result_aggregatedmake.csv', index=False)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm baffled that Noone here seems to have asked this question, I still think I might have chosen the wrong terminology when searching, so sorry of this is a double post or sth. Here I go:
 There are so many algorithms that do specialized things today, that it's almost impossible to keep track of it. I just learned about Featboost -published a year ago- which may be really helpful when there are loads of features in a dataset and that got me thinking. Given that most of us have to work with predictive modeling, there always remains the questions:" did I choose the right model?" Or maybe also:" is there a serious improvement to be expected from another model, since I deployed my initial solution?"
 To put it in a nutshell: how do you choose a model for a given problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 ​
 I've been trying to fill the gaps of my knowledge related to data science, and it has been quite a challenge. I have a mechanical engineer and business analytics background, I have worked as a data analyst before, and I feel like a have a lot to learn yet. However, when I try looking for information on the internet, whether by finding the best yt videos, books, threads, I see so much volume of information that I get lost and don't know where to go next.
 ​
 I have studied prob&tatistics, I have studied programming, I understand some of the concepts of Machine Learning, yet when I try to check a winning notebook for a kaggle competition I still feel like I haven't learned anything. At the moment I'm feeling like I am in some sort of limbo where I have some knowledge that needs a bridge to take me further, but I don't know where to start.
 ​
 Does anyone here ever felt like that, and was able to surpass this phase?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My background is in an analytical field but I have never worked as a data scientist. I failed all the interviews where they required a take home task. Then I found a DS job where they just asked technical questions but without a hands-on component. I was hired.
 So my first job as a data scientist went OK, and I stayed in a company for little over a year. Other data scientists there were not much better than me and I feel like the expectations were pretty low. It was mainly re-working some old code and writing documentation. In fact, although I learned a little, I was bored most of the time. There was never any new modelling. 
 I landed another role recently where they also only had a technical interview but no tasks. I actually made a few mistakes in the interview and was surprised that they offered me a job. I am now 2 weeks in and am pretty scared. This job is whole another level. All my peers are really technically strong and I don't even understand what they are talking about some of the time. I am self-trained so there are a lot of gaps. I am also now at a senior level so the expectations are higher.
 I don't know what to do. I still have a chance to return to my old role but they will advertise for someone else soon. My old role doesn't offer much learning but at least I can do it!

Thing is that the number of features is too high, with more than 2,000 features to deal with. I've never faced analysis on a dataset that big, so I don't know the best way to perform a correct feature selection in order to reduce the problem dimensionality to a bunch of most-relevant features. From your point of view, what's the best strategy to face a problem like this?

For that, my historical dataset has multiple date columns such as open date, close date, last updated date. I have researched and read that i can divide date to 3 new columns, Date, Month and Year. Since this is a classification problem, I'm thinking to use Logistic or Decision Tree. Can someone please guide me on how I can use these date columns correctly? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[so i am pretty sure everybody has been amazed by the potential of chatGPT and openAI's future products. However, I feel most people seem to ignore one huge problem that chatGPT has, it's their "content filter and ethics guidelines", which I feel is super biased.
 I remember the first day chatGPT went out, some people bypassed this filter and could ask chatGPT to help them create molotov, but openAI kept adding more and more filters so people couldn't bypass this anymore. And recently Time media investigation published a report on how openAI hired $2/hour kenyan slave labors to filter contents on chatGPT.
 I know AI is here to stay and will replace a lot of jobs, but it can only go mainstream if it doesn't have censorship that openAI put on its products. Because if AIs can keep adding more "ethics" filters, most politicians will just put pressure on openAI and other similar companies to help them detect and filter out oppositions to create very biased narrative and mass censorship. and you cant do anything about it because their source of truth will be considered "ethics guidelines". 
 Thoughts?
