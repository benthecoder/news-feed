        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have recently been offered a high level position at a startup that is very AI focused. They are focused on mainly defense projects (which is great for me as it is my domain). Most of their funding has come from SIBR projects. I am worried as they are not well known and reading over their website is like a buzzword bingo for AI/ML. What are some questions I should be asking before I make a decision? Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got an interview be a software engineer II at a non-profit. I'm posting in this subreddit because a) I trust this community more than r/cscareerquestions and b) the role is about developing pipelines to process and analyze neuroimaging data, so it's related to data science.
 Here are some relevant details about me:
  
I have one year of experience processing and analyzing neuroimaging data in a lab
 I taught myself python, R, frequentist and Bayesian statistics, and implement new computer vision research for my job
 I lead a group of PhD students to implement (and improve on) image segmentation algorithms
 I'm published
 I have a graduate certificate in neuroscience
 I have two bachelor degrees in philosophy and English respectively (although I've completed math up to and including differential equations)
  
Here are some relevant details about the position given my research:
  
Given my years of experience, Base pay for a software engineer II at this non-profit is $109,765
 Base pay for a software engineer in the area is $121,987
 Cost of living is $44,557
 I have no idea if they're offering bonuses, stock-options, or profit sharing
  
The recruiter/hiring manager wants me to name a salary. I haven't even started the first round of interviews yet.
 I don't care how much I'm payed so long as I get my foot in the door. However, I worry that if I value myself too little that they'll be turned off.
 How much should I suggest? I'm thinking 75k to 100k with the caveat that I'm open to negotiation.
 Also, is it a bad sign that they're asking me to name a salary?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First time posting and I need advice please. Apologies for the bad explanation.. I’m not a data scientist or studying it. 
 / / /
 My startup is needing a service that can essentially scan (or scrape) all LinkedIn profiles for cold-outreach campaigns.
 We would want AI to search LinkedIn for our target audience based on 3 primary categories.. 
 So we feed the algorithm some data of the idea client we want to email… 
 specific occupation , age and the person plays an instrument as a hobby
 Then the service can look for people on LinkedIn who match the input criteria. Giving us a simple output data list (name, LinkedIn profile, possible email) 
 / / /
 I am 100% new to this. So sorry I’m advance for poorly explaining this. Just need an efficient way to gather possible leads for cold outreach marketing campaigns. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My goal is to learn `hypothesis testing one sample one sided`. Honestly, I don't get it.
 Hypothesis testing one sample RIGHT SIDED
 ```
 H0: μ <= x̄
 H1: μ > x̄
 ```
 For example, I have a `pg_df = pd.DataFrame([10,9,9,10,11,9,8])`
 The `pg_df.mean()` is 9.4
 Questions:
  
Google have been saying μ is mean population. But why do we compare it with imaginary mean population e.g `H0: μ <= 15` instead of the actual mean sample e.g `H0: μ <= 9.4`?
  
```
 statistic, pvalue = stats.ttest_1samp(a = pg_df, popmean=15, alternative="greater")statistic, pvalue
 ```
 The p-value is 0.9, which is larger than the significance level of 0.05. Thus, we fail to reject null hypothesis. Which we can conclude that the mean population is lower than 15.
  
If we fail to reject `H0: : μ <= 15`, is the conclusion "the mean population is lower than 15"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like these jobs are very rare and they require a great amount of experience and do not pay well.
 I'm commencing a degree in data science but I'm also of a strong anti-capitalist mindset and could not care less about most of what data science seems to be about when it comes to job opportunities, i.e. "maximising profit", often without any ethical considerations and to the detriment of many people. In fact, know I would be fired quickly in any job of that type.
 I wonder if I should reconsider my degree and maybe study something else.

 I am in my senior year, and I want to learn the necessary tools to be a data analyst, and then I will move to be a data scientist in the future. my purpose is to work asp, without lacking prior knowledge and experience. I still have some time after graduation.
 I found some roadmaps, I want your advice is it good? what should I do while studying? should I study algorithms and data structure? will this give me a better chance? and after all, how did you manage to get through the mentality of the begging?
 The links:
  
 GitHub - AhmedUZaki/Eng.-Mohamed-Hammad-AI-Recommendations: The repo contains books, tutorials and resources based on the recommendations of Eng Mohammed Hammad. 
  GitHub - datasciencemasters/go: The Open Source Data Science Masters

  medium.com
  
for some reason, I am inclined to the last one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in industry for about 2 years as a supply chain grad working in data analytics roles. My current employed will pick up the bill for me to get a masters in DS, and a lot of people on here have recommended GT's course.
 I graduated undergrad with a 3.2, little to no coding experience. I've reached out to their admissions people and haven't gotten a reply back. Is there any hope for me to get in the program? Is prior coding experience needed for GT's course/or really any good DS master's course?
 Would greatly appreciate some feedback. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've found I generally rely on business knowledge/ metrics when solving problems at work. Which is needed, but sometimes I feel too challenged when I see a "new" kind of problem. I think I probably felt challenged in that manner when I was early on in my career.
 Are there some resources available to practise this skill? One way to do this are those case studies (like the ones typically asked in consulting), but otherwise I'm at a loss as to what ways to improve this. Or maybe strategies to help break down an ambiguous problem, where / how can I practise this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm missing something
 The graph below has been used to show the increase in # of deaths in 2022.
 According to the bottom line "Excess is calculated by subtracting deaths from the baseline (...) which is calculated as pre pandemic average of 2015-2019 adjusted for the linear trend", so shouldn't be meaning that deaths are decreasing and not increasing?
 If I take the baseline and subtract the number of deahts, and deaths are decreasing the number should increase, doesn't it?
 However, the points on the graph, are indicated as "excess mortality: x deaths/100k"
 What am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering if traditional statistics/EDA/visualization really scales to "big data" and whether it is really useful to process an entire "big dataset" for EDA vs just sub-sampling.
 I realize of course that deep learning DOES scale to big data, and I'm in no way doubting that. I'm just asking what other data science technique ALSO scale to big data (e.g. billions of samples)?
 P.S. I'm also asking in the context of map-reduce. That design paradigm seems to imply that data-processing on that scale is useful outside of the context of Deep learning.
 I'm wondering if I could get practical examples where that is obviously true (preferably in EDA/statistics but other examples are welcome as well).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have given data for users which is right skewed with a long tail, meaning high gmv is driven by few users. Now I have 2 cohorts of users for whom I want to compare gmv distribution. My first instinct was to go for t-test but it has an assumption of normality. Though I also found I my readings that if my sample size is large enough (typically > 100) central limit theorem would kick in and the difference in mean should be normally distributed so I should be able to apply t-test on my raw data. 
 But there is no literature on effect size calculation if my data is skewed, I am thinking of Cohen's D and since it also assumes normality, perform log normal transformation on my data and perform t test and Cohen's D on that. 
 From my reading transformed t-test p value is applicable for raw data as well but not sure about Cohen's D. 
 Any guidance on how this kind of analysis is usually done would be really helpful.

I am a solo founder that just finished writing code for my project (MVP) and am ready to find clients.
- for the sake of the question, my clients will be small physical businesses. Think, Family Doctor's Office, Local Cafe, Small barber, etc.
I will be developing a blog for SEO purposes and doing other things to promote my business online. However, I believe the key to success here will be "Cold Sales". I have never done that before. So, if you could recommend a book, a blog post, other online resources, or you just have a random advice that I could learn from, I would be very thankful.
Suffice it to say I will be starting out ASAP, even though I don't know anything. I believe practice is the best teacher. However, if there are any resources that could help me get up and running quicker that would be awesome. Thanks a ton in advance.

 The root of the entropy formula is inverse probability, so why minimize this instead of maximizing probability. Is it a pohtato potahto kind of thing? Does it make a difference?

I am at the point that if I train a model off of a dataset, it will only be as good as the dataset and will be immideatly the same level as the dataset. What I want to achieve is to create an agent, it makes moves off of random bias, then depending on the game outcome, change the bias (a generational AI). I have done some searching online and virtually no one has done this approche before. I idealy want to show both models competing against each other at the same level and show that both agents have a learning curve. I know how to setup the game to play off of a dataset, but I dont know how to approch my idea. How can I setup agents that are initially random bias, and only do a move that is within a pre make list of possible moves. Any ideas where to start/how to approch my idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[the youtube video for the How to Win a Data Science Competition Learn from Top Kagglers has been taken down as the youtube channel was also deleted, i assume that one of the reasons is due to them being russian which is why their course was also taken down from coursera. I was at the part wherein they talked about their solutions in past competitions which is the final hour i'd say and then the channel got deleted. So if it is ok and if it is possible please give a link of the video as i'd like to finish it
 EDIT: i know that the videos are also in bilibili but they don't have english subtitles like in youtube and i'm having a hard time understanding some of the words they're saying due to their accent

When a problem is given and it has to be solved by ai, is it possible to deduce beforehand, i.e. just by seeing the problem, whether it is computatable intractability ? I've looked it up on the internet and watched youtube videos, but its not clear to me. What to look out for to draw that conclusion. For example: should the sequence be ascending or descending? 
 I hope someone can help me with this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know there are a lot of posts about resources, but I don't recall seeing this specifically. 
 I'm looking for for resources for Bayes statistics. Everything I've found is either simple examples meant to introduce a concept... or very theoretical without many examples. 
 I need something in the middle, examples that are complex and varied enough to get into details. Maybe even something that progresses in difficult. Currently going over MCMC, but I actually thing it's more basic Bayes stuff that I'm getting hung up on. 
 I might be a bit weird... i'm good at math, but not strong. What i mean is: I went up through Calc II in college and didn't have issues with it, but between a lack of application or practice, I've been struggling with the stats/math side of DS classes. 
 In honestly considering dropping this class, just so I can study and retake it next term. Any assistance is appreciated!
