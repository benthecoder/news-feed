I’m really enjoying studying and working with modeling but I don’t know if this is just a false impression or if data sciences is really what I want. I would love to hear more from someone who did this career changing. Thank you very much in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before we talk about replacement, let us try to understand the real value of a good programmer. A good programmer’s value is not merely knowing "how to code." Programmers bring value by understanding "what to code."
 Simply put, they need to understand the business value of each requirement to be built and decide and prioritize their development based on the criticality. In a nutshell, they have fully functional "thinking" human brains.
 And the AI we see today is data-based. Yes, it can do things like categorizing images on Google, reading license plates, powering the routines of Alexa and Siri, and even using highly sophisticated methods of classifying data and recognizing patterns.
 But it cannot think like a human brain. For AI systems to be capable of 'thinking,' they need to be continually trained and fed with giant data banks covering every possible human scenario. This is not 100% possible.
 That is why AI can write code but can't ensure that it has written the correct code. It cannot understand the business value of features. It cannot refactor an old, buggy code and cannot decide whether to remove a piece of code or not.
 So, the future of software development and AI is collaboration and integration. AI will help programmers redefine programming by taking over tedious, repetitive tasks so that programmers can focus on building something great.
 Programmers can also pair with AI to write better software and reduce development lifecycle times. And far from replacing programmers, AI is becoming ready to reimagine a programmer’s workload through integration and enhanced efficiency.
 Here are five benefits of using AI in software development:
  
AI can validate project requirements
 Automatic debugging
 Automatic testing
 AI can make programmers more efficient
 AI will change software development

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new competition has just opened for registration by the United Nations, which will run in parallel to G20 in Indonesia but is open to all to participate remotely too. It will run from 8-11 of November, but pre-registration is required for individuals or teams up to 3.
 The competition differs from the typical Kaggle / DrivenData competitions because it focuses on the use of Privacy Enhancing Technologies to access and learn from the data. Taking part, you will interact with secure enclaves, differential privacy and synthetic data and become familiar with some of the leading privacy data science libraries like OpenDP (Harvard), SmartNoise (Microsoft) and DiffPrivLib (IBM Research). 
 There are also going to be a number of venues around the world where you can join in in-person and meet like-minded data scientists. The first location announcement was Harvard's John A. Paulson School Of Engineering And Applied Sciences for those in the Greater Boston Area. 
 There will also be webinars and Q&A ahead of time with the lead developers of each of the prominent frameworks. 
 For more information and registration: https://petlab.officialstatistics.org/ 
 If you would like to host an in-person location at a university or public space, reach out to [mira@oblivious.ai](mailto:mira@oblivious.ai), and there is support to help you run it successfully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta has just released AIT, an inference system for AMD and NVIDIA GPU hardware that claims to provide excellent inference performance.
 AITemplate transforms AI models into high-performance CUDA/HIP C++ code. It performs various graph transformations and optimizes execution time with new C++ kernel templates for the GPU target, while maintaining a minimal dependency on external libraries CUDA/ROCm.
 https://github.com/facebookincubator/AITemplate
 This is a really promising project intended to be an alternative to TensorRT and other inference tools. As maintainers of the opensource nebullvm inference accelerator, I am very eager to see the performance of AIT compared to other inference tools. We are working on integrating AIT in nebullvm so that users can test AIT, TensorRT, ONNX Runtime and other state-of-the-art inference optimizers to see which one provides the best performance for your model and hardware.
 Kudos Meta!

Most of the time I do descriptive analyses with my team on tabular data with a goal to find where models can be useful. I also worked with scrapers, models and modeling pipelines a little bit. My boss told my team that we have budget for self development, so he encouraged us to use this funding for something useful for us, so I am looking for any relevant courses. I checked courses on coursera and they seem to be more entry level. I already had MLops course from coursera which I liked since it covered a lot of things we could possibly apply in the future. Tbh I have a feeling that I can get more knowledge from reading articles and relevant books and doing small projects, but funding has to be used, so. Do you have any interesting recommendations? Now I am considering to take something from Andrew Ng classic, since we don't have a need to use any neural nets on tabular data and I start forgetting things. I also have a feeling that I don't know statistics as well as I supposed to, but I am not sure there are any online courses which cover more than the average course in my uni. Last option is some cloud certifications, but we don't have anything in clouds by now and I am not sure if I need it currently.

 I was recently wondering whether I could use more relaxed phases at work to contribute to a certain cause. One I set my eyes on is human trafficking, but I suspect it requires heavier intelligence type of work, where familiarity is key (though I have experience with that), and less an occasional data analysis project. In case of any relevance - I’m living in Europe, but happy to look at any opportunity that has no issue with remote work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm new to machine learning and have been mostly practicing several models and algorithms based on large, publicly available datasets (some typical ones like digit classification and iris flower).
 Now, I want to apply what I've learned to develop my own project. In general, it involves data on economic and social issues for children in Vietnam - I want to predict the likelihood of children getting full education levels throughout their lifetime (the label is 1 or 0, so I guess the logit and decision trees will be considered). But it is so hard to find any datasets for it!
 I feel like it is either I change my project topic tailored to any kinda-relevant datasets that are available online or I have to collect the data by myself (using surveys or getting from multiple secondary databases). Have you ever experienced this? How would you resolve the data collection part? I think the data is the first and most important step and I could not continue if there is no data.
 Thank you very much! I really appreciate any thoughts or advice. And I'm sorry if any of my information is confusing or requires more explanation.

 I just completed one year at my job. I’m gonna keep things really vague. It’s at a small organization. I work with a lot of attorneys. We do a lot direct client services, and we do a lot of public policy work. I have a technical background in biosci. When I was hired, they asked me to take care of some data stuff. Now i do a lot of data work. I taught myself python / pandas pretty well. I’ve worked with tableau. I’ve built scrapers. I’ve uncovered insights. I’ve communicated my work. I’ve helped customize a new CRM. I’ve designed new workflows. I also take care of a lot of the other tech needs of the org.
 I’m not quite sure exactly what I would call my job title at this point. I understand fairly well that I could be geared to become a Data Analyst…]]></summary>

 I’m not really versed in A.I or deepfake technology. My question is, with the democratization of this sort of tech, how can platforms or developers themselves prevent these kinds of videos from getting exposure, and possibly harming people? Can certain demographics be preyed on with this kind of tech?

The code contains python packages such as graphql to extract the data and sqlalchemy to inject the data into the database. I’m trying integrate this code into beam api, but I have no clue how to do so. Do I have to generate the data first and then use the csv output for my pipeline or can I just insert all of this into a beam pipeline and extract the csv by executing the apache beam code? Any help is extremely appreciated thank you for reading.

 We have a ID (let’s call it Pseudo ID) which represents a customer, that has their session(s) as another ID inside of it. 
 We’re seeing about 4% of the sessions have the same Pseudo ID. We think it’s because it’s the same customer switching between desktop and mobile devices, but hard to tell.
 Should we exclude the duplicate Pseudo IDs? The lift of the experiment is positive if you include or exclude them, but the variance is about 5% between the results. 
 How would you look at this? Include the duplicate IDs, or exclude them?

I am at a New Zealand university (top 150 in all three fields, top 100 worldwide). 
 A lot of my interested overlap with data science, but focusing down on it would require me to neglect a lot of other interests.
 My interests include;
  
Parallel/distributed computing and algorithms
 Algorithm design and analysis, proof of correctness, etc.
 AI (interested, but never worked adequately with)
 Business Analytics
 Probability, stochastic calculus, modelling
 Data collection, data engineering
 Systems designs - e.g. distributed web crawlers, the specifics behind obscure stuff like link shorteners.

 I work for a fortune 15 company. We work for internal stakeholders and try to build an ML use case around their problems. We work in a team of 3-4 people, we call it a pod. Our pod consists of DS, DE, BA, Data Visualization engineer, and product owners from the business side.
  
Do you typically work in this structure?
 For DS to succeed, what do you think, how important is it to have a great supporting team (DE, BA etc.)?
 Are there pros and cons of it you can think of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got a scholarship to do a MSc in health data science but its an applied program and has no math. It also has no databasing or data management course. SQL isnt covered at all. 
 Im wondering if I should skip on it. The alumni tell me its no good for people who are already professionals and I am already a professional epidemiologist with a fair amount of stats background. 
 Is it worth it? I mean theres the opportunity cost obviously. I lose a year of life and income, and then Im forced to remain in my third world country for 2 years after. It is offerred by a so called top 35 world University in the UK but the omissions are very strange. I do not know R, Python, machine learning, AI, etc
 CLIFF: I am wondering if in the opinion of data scientists out there if the ommission of math and data management would be a complete deal breaker for you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'll keep this short. I learned and had been using R for Data Science. Unfortunately R has fallen out of favor, and I clearly see the vast majority of organizations moving to Python if they have not already.
 How do I transition and get into Python? I have zero experience with it. I'm a bit of a throwback statistician who's previously used SPSS and SAS at various points, plus some propriety tools. My background and interest is more on the statistics side in general, less on computer science.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just figured the explanation that I added with question wasn't posted. So, here's the scenario:
 We open sales of a product begining of the Fall every year. Now that we have data collected about the customers and their transactions, we are trying to predict customer level probability of purchasing the product before Fall - ideally each week of Summer to use that to customize promotional campaign. 
 What we are planning to do is get historic data snapshots as of the end of Summer, train model on this data. Thhen from the next Summer use this model to predict the outcome of the Fall purchase. Now the question was basically, does it sound like a sound technique to use this end of Summer model to predict during the Summer? Or should we train separate models for each week of Summer - so basically for each weekly model we'd get historic data snapshots as of the end of that week rather than end of the whole Summer and train the models separately.

Recently I've been looking into using XGBoost and AdaBoost and I'm unsure what is the best way to incorporate past features.

 And honestly I have no idea what to do going forward. Everyone there is accountant and a few economics background. But no one with a statistics or math background to my knowledge. 
 So basically they have given me a list of every audit they have done for the last ten years. And want me to find a way to help them choose vouchers to audit that are more likely to be inappropriate. 
 I have a bunch of data, the vendor, the payments amount, how long did they look at the voucher before they approved it. And everything you can think of. I just have no idea the best method to use. I was just thinking of doing logistic regression, but I don’t know if you guys have any better suggestions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Comic Code is a monospaced adaptation of Comic Sans. Designed specifically for programming, which is a corner of typography that involves intensive typing that feels more akin to handwriting than typesetting, this typeface took inspirations from the friendly characteristics and low-resolution legibility of Comic Sans. It is an unapologetic admittance of the positives of the source design, and a literal manifestation of “code like nobody’s watching”. Comic Code only takes inspiration from Comic Sans and was drawn entirely from scratch, in case you are wondering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, I’m employed as a data scientist, but primarily manage small teams and work with management on data strategy. It’s not an optimal layout, but I’m enjoying this, “management / strategy” aspect. 
 I might not be perfectly equipped to apply for data science manager roles, so I’ve come to ask for a your opinion. 
 What are your thoughts on the data science manager position: what skills are necessary, how does it differ to senior data science positions, and any personal experiences?
 Thanks!
