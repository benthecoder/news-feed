 If i were to try to find correlation between them and try to find patterns in them, how to start and go about doing that. what softwares or data mining tools/ data analysis tools should i be looking at. or nothing like that is available?
 further more, my objective here is to correlate the astrological charts and stock price charts and seeif any patterns emerge or not.
 Is there any way to accomplish this? any suggestions or guidance is appreciated.
 i have been trying to do this the manual way for the past 3 years and i have made some interesting discoveries, but i need to mine more data more efficiently to have any conclusive results and the manual methods just dont cut it, it will probably take hundred's of years to get the results that i am looking for.

 In the meantime i have been applying for Entry level Data scientist roles for 3 months now and haven't recieved any interview calls yet. I have completed a few POC end to end projects + a Research publication around DS domain.
 Should I resign from my current job and keep looking for new opportunities whilst I'm serving my notice period with my current organization?
 Is it worth taking that risk?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pls redirect me to the right place if I'm lost.
 Is there an independent non-human entity that build things in real life?
 Here's an example. Software. I write software that does the following
 Contact building construction companies
 Give one of them a job e.g temple, monument, etc with detailed instructions about design, location, etc
 Pay them (software interacts with online banking, 2FA stuff, and is good enough to work despite UI changes, so software has control over bank accounts that are funded for this purpose. server costs, 2fa costs, etc are paid from this account as well.. )
 Check if the job is complete
 Do this once a year for the next N years
 ps funds in the account are invested in index funds and the software withdraws money only when needed. server is rented from 5 different large providers in case 4 of them stops working in the way that the software knows how to interact. software is run concurrently from 5 locations in case 4 of them goes out. etc .. I can write 2 more pages of details to make this sound a lot more realistic but I hope you get the idea
 I die and no one else knows that this exists. Yet this entity keeps creating buildings in real life.

I am going through a datascience program in a reputed US institution to enhance my profile. After completing my program, I am thinking about freelancing and serving as a consultant. the more important question for me is, if I want to solve some real projects to test my basics, where will be a good place to start? also if I want to work for a company just for experience and worry about pay, how can I reach out to such a company? where do companies advertise for hiring part-time datascientists?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it correct that with a sufficiently large - in terms of layers and nodes - neural network, that when trained, the network kind of performs feature engineering? I know that would not be formally how to describe it, but does a neural network find interesting patterns in the data that are kind of like features that are maybe even difficult to describe? Here's an example to describe what I'm getting at.
 just say I'm trying to predict what picture a person is looking at based upon their brain activity, which I measure with EEG as a time series, across 128 electrodes. with a neural network can I just feed in the raw time series voltage recordings, and that will take case of discerning any valuable features, or should I also create a bunch of feature from the data - like mean, std. dev, median, entropy etc?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m starting to dip my toe into talking to recruiters, to make sure I have options if my company doesn’t promote me this cycle. One job opening from a guy who reached out caught my eye- predictive modeling to drive marketing ROI; most importantly they have a 4-day work week haha. 
 The thing is, my title is DS but I work mainly on analytics/insights right now. I am in grad school learning ML but have done only a couple ML type things at work so far- regression model to find relationship between economic indicators and sales; clustering to create marketing segments; and a few other more basic things. 
 How can I position myself to this recruiter for a role that focuses on predictive modeling, if I’ve only done some toy projects at school and a handful of things at work beyond the insights work?

 But dealing with people is not my thing. Looking long term, what types of jobs can I work toward where I would mostly deal with spreadsheets and data and not have to manage people? And be somewhat independent, working on projects and deadlines.

Wondering if I should include the features that I clustered on in my regression model as well as the clusters themselves? E.g. my clusters were created using features X, Y, Z. Should I include the clusters I created as categorical features AS WELL AS the original X, Y, and Z features in my regression model?
 My thought is yes, as the clusters do include information about the relationships between the features but not to a granular level as the features themselves. Is this assumption correct?

I am trying to look for a good system as to build a 3d map for blocks, where I can place blocks in a certain way and then make files for this, so that I can have a robot read this and place along this. The file could be JSON however I am not sure how to layer it. Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heyo, I require assistance!
 I have stumbled upon some weird problem and as a beginner I can't seem to find a good solution to resolve it.
 I have a bunch of data sets. Each of the data sets represents a 3-month period. Inside each of them there are some kind of prices starting from almost 0 and usually going up. After each 3-month period the prices "reset". The decomposition of one of these currencies looks something like that ( it is an image of couple 3-month peroids combined )
 https://preview.redd.it/q7ghtlu3hh3a1.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bbe95f6e57ad44a8ea5961659bd1e20425604dd
 My questoin is how would I go about making the most of analysis there and how would I go about creating a model that could possibly predict the upcoming 3 months?

Apparently the model were using is 'time slice' (this was told to our class yesterday in an ad hoc q and a session I couldn't attend because it was scheduled the day before). It is NOT a discrete event simulation. Lecturer is very adamant about that. I've done some googling and Wikipedia thinks a time slice model is a type of discrete event simulation. I'm totally lost. Can anyone help plz????

 Do these show my interest enough? Half of these are personal I'd say and others are from school. I also recently got my AZ900 certification and am learning how to actually do stuff on Azure in my own time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been getting a lot of third party recruiter messages hiring for Meta 12 month contractor roles. In the past, I've just been recruited by Meta recruiters directly so I'm wary of these opportunities especially after Meta fired a bunch of people. In one particular instance, a recruiting company is spam calling me after I had one conversation with them.
 Are they a scam?

I used the caret packaged to optimize the parameters, and the model was derived using the nnet package. I am interested in calculating shap values and plotting a beeswarm plot to demonstrate how individual features are correlated with the outcome and the direction of that relationship. Is there anyway to do this in R studio? Most packages which calculate shap values (DALEX, IML) only calculate single instance values, but I would like to aggregate multiple shap values from many instances (in this case, patients) into a single plot like a beeswarm plot

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello -- I'm here to share what seems to be a large inefficiency in the way my company works and compare my experiences to yours. 
 The main issue is how we share scripts for current projects and access old code from previous work. You can dig up people's repositories and deal with whatever is in there with whatever documentation they randomly decided to include but if you have a specific question or roadblock your only option is to send and email and hope it earns a helpful reply ... and that's if you can actually find what you're looking for. 
 We have no way to trace the steps used for old projects to revisit aspects of our workflows that could be re-employed for current work. 
 Is this standard?
 Has anybody encountered a solution to keep track of what happened to solve previous problems in a manner that can be easily called upon to solve current problems?
