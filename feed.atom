        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if this is a dumb question, but I've been doing a lot of searching and have found nothing on this topic.
 I am trying to put together a logistic regression model to predict the outcome of MMA fights (win or loss). (I know sorry for the sports regression).
 How do I run my model without using data from future fights that have not happened yet? E.g. if the fight occurs on 1/1/22, any info on the fighters in fights that occurred after that date should not be included and every fight up to that date is included?
 I am working in python if there are any specific solutions I should be aware of.
 Appreciate any input.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just trying to gauge how you all determine your sample sizes. I’ve always just kinda rule-of-thumb gone with minimum sample of 100 but no more than 1000, and aimed for maybe 10% of the population count. 
 Additionally, how do you all determine iterations for calculating the means of sample means? Here I just pull a number out of my butt that’s kinda big…
 What I’m finding on a toy data set (from real data) is that if my sample sizes are kinda big, like 1000, then my distribution of sample means is basically a single bar around some number that is very different than my population mean. If I reduce my sample size to 30-50 ish, my mean of sample means is closer to my population mean and the distribution is more “normal” in a sense. 
 My population is in the 1,000,000 range for counts of observations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello we are seeking a volunteer(s) specializing in machine learning AI development t assist on a couple of collaborative group projects centered around developing advanced market trading AI. One is a hybrid series of parallel and perpendicular AI chains that filter out the best predictions for the "big moves" for the next 24 hour period, the other is a bot generator that sends bots out to search the web for key data points and trades automatically based on that. We are seeking those with any background in software development. It is worth mentioning that while this project only offers exclusive access to the finished product, those who make it to the end may also be offered a paid position in the startup company that the founder of this group owns (the company is not in any way involved with this project). Thanks for your time, feel free to comment directly on here if you're interested or DM me directly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently debating the way we're going to implement an algorithm change for an opinion ranking tool. Would really appreciate any opinions on the scenarios below!
 ---
 Imagine 100 people participated in a simple ranking exercise where they were asked to rank 10 options from 1st (most important) to 10th (least important). Participants were allowed to submit incompletes as long as they included 2 or more of the 10 options. Would you expect the scoring algorithm to:
  
Calculate the score for each option based only on the total number of participants who *included* that option in their personal ranking.
 Assume that any non-inclusions were the equivalent of a last-place rank, giving 0 points in those cases and therefore using the total 100 participants when calculating the overall score for each option.
  
We currently use Glicko-2 to score ranking options. Due to Glicko-2's comparative format, we often see researchers include new ranking options mid-project, adding additional participants until the ratings deviation reaches a similar level to the original ranking options. While we can replicate this format with a Borda Count using method 1 above, I would imagine the majority of researchers would expect the survey to use method 2.
 An optional third method would be to combine the two approaches -- to rank newly-added options based on all participants that saw it, ie. only using a total count of 60 participants if the new option was added after the 40th participant completed their ranking.
 Interested to hear what you think? We've found that Glicko-2 is a black box for researchers and therefore they can't ensure their findings will be adopted and trusted when people disagree with the results.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context: I oversee marketing analytics team for a large organization that owns many smaller companies. The company is currently transitioning into an enterprise mindset and is trying to uniform the SFDB for each of these companies. Holistically, it's not ready for deep analytics and we spend a lot of time building/hacking together BI reports and working to automate a slew of marketing data connections into a central DB. Busy + working on foundations on the fly is the key take away here. Not a ton of analytics actually going on.
 One of these companies has the data volume, internal resources, and data framework that would be needed to double down into actual analytic investigation. After showing them how it is impossible to find actionable insights on marketing strategy with our current ecosystem, they caught the vision that we need to design proper modeling/testing vs eyeballing - and that the upside is enormous.
 There is appetite to start designing marketing tests to optimize for revenue and diminishing return. However, we need someone who can embed with this group and navigate what type of data environment they need to answer the questions we want to ask, educate leadership and developers in building the data environment, and then lead them in building test arms. Finally, assessing results + iterating.
 I recently got the buy-in to add headcount to our team. I'm not sure what resource to add though. We have 2 data analysts who are eager to lean and apply more data science. I don't know if we should come in with a net new data science 'heavy hitter' to establish enterprise standards, a data engineer, or let my team learn to navigate this on top of their other responsibilities.

 Today we launched Out-of-Distribution Detection to help you automatically find and remove outliers in your datasets so you can train models and perform analytics on reliable data.
 Our algorithms detect out-of-distribution data like this \"3\" included in a clothing dataset
 What makes this different from existing OOD methods?
 Many complex OOD detection algorithms exist but they are only applicable to specific data types. Our research shows that our package works as effectively as these complex methods, but also works with any type of data for which either a feature embedding or trained classifier is available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! 
 I’m currently a bit confused career-wise and would like to ask your opinion and advice on improving my skills. 
 My goal professionally is to work in data science in a finance related company (although I’m open to other ideas too). I have a bachelors degree in economics and I’m now finishing my master in data science and economics. Putting a lot of effort over the last two years, I’ve managed to achieve a solid intermediate level in Python, R, Tableau and PostgreSQL. I also work part time as a tech freelancer in a startup (but more on the data collection side). 
 Lately I’ve been asking a couple of professors and co-workers about data science career options and skills to improve. Some of them directly say that I need a degree in computer science. What is your opinion? After my master I would like to get a full time job, but I can’t help but think that I’m lacking skills. Is a computer science degree in my situation necessary, or are there other certificates/tools I can carry out to improve? Lately I’ve considered undertaking the professional data engineer certification for Google cloud to broaden my skills. What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So our company "bought" databricks and now they want us to use it for everything :D I understand that it's a very good platform for data engineering but is anyone using it for ML? It always spins up a spark cluster so simply using it as a notebook to train tensorflow model looks like a waste of reasources. It has MLflow but other than that it looks like a poor platform for ML. Or am I wrong here?

 But i'm facing a issue around itens, i had a bunch of itens that i can`t process even using GCP clusters.
 So a possible approach it is to use some sampling technique, but how can this affect the result?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I’ve been working in data science for 5 years after finishing my studies in artificial intelligence. I’ve worked as a freelancer, in corporate and the past years mostly ran my own startups. Doing a large variety of ML projects in many different industries.
 I’ve applied for about 300 jobs in 6 months, online, often through LinkedIn/angellist 
 Most don’t respond at all. 2nd most common is automated no thank you. 3 most common is that I talk to an intern recruiter with the no understanding whatsoever of the role. E.g. “I see you have experience in Python programming. Do you also do pandas programming?” Or “I see you have data science experience, how about data analytics?” 
 How does one work in data and Python, and not know how to use pandas or to do analytics? My study was mostly linear algebra, statistics and calculus.
 I do find myself being approached by many recruiters, for freelance long term positions. Great, makes a lot of money and I’m used to working like that. I’ve made about 6 assignments with datasets for different companies. Couple days of work often. Send it to the head of whatever, no reply. Then they answer with one sentence stating they already found someone or they actually like it and want to move forward and then ghost me.
 Does anyone have similar experiences, and if so, why is this happening? I’ve always had job offers in the past years. Just until this year it seems like I can’t find any job at all.
 I’m a little lost tbh. I’m literally considering going to another industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone =) I just wanted to ask a quick question now that I am more familiar with ML models.
 I have read and read many articles stating the (sometimes many) assumptions of different models, be it linear or logistic regression, support vector machines, and so on. All these articles teach you how to check for these assumptions, but they don't tell you what assumptions must be held for the model to be implemented effectively. 
 Some of them I can deduct myself: if there is no linear relationship between X and y you shouldn't force a linear regression on it, for example. If the outcome is not binary you shouldn't force logistic regression on it. And so on. But others I don't know how to evaluate, and with what level of stringency they need to be met before you throw out the model altogether and try something else.
 What if the points in the QQ plot are not perfectly linear and some values escape the line at the beginning and end of the graph while being still mostly linear? What there is some heteroscedasticity in the residuals? Do you get rid of all influential outliers? Can you leave some in? How do you justify these decisions?
 I feel like there are plenty of tutorials out there on how to check on assumptions for plenty of models, but I am struggling to find ones that take the time to explain in detail to what degree certain assumptions can be left unmet before you have to throw out the model altogether and think of another approach. Any suggestions for reads? Links?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently a undergraduate junior majoring in computer science,statistics and, math. I am interested in getting a MS in data science or something related, however right now i’m not sure where to devote my time for finding work during the summer. I am currently working on research (that I love) in geostatistics and use machine learning and optimization techniques and would be able to continue during the summer if I can’t find anything else.
 With computer science, many people stress the importance of getting a software engineering internship, however, I’m not sure if its as important since I don’t plan to go into industry right after graduation (and also i feel like SWE can be loosely related to DS depending on the position). Then there are REUs (prestigious summer research) that I can apply for, however, since I am already doing research, I don’t know if it would be better to focus on applying to internships. 
 I don’t really know what competitive grad school programs are looking for in applicants aside from gpa, GRE, and research, and would like advice on how to improve my chances of being accepted into a good program.
