        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not an expert in data science; currently an astronomy grad student finishing up the program but planning to start a career in data analysis. I’ve used Python with astronomy images and analysis. But I want to learn data analysis tools to find a job outside of academia. Someone suggested me Udemy. But so far I have taken some courses in Coursera. Which one is your pick? Any advice would be appreciated!

What I thought is that education techniques must made in order to prepare citizens for the future to be able to analyze and understand situations in which Data Science is present in real life and I think this should be implemented as part of both basic and professional education.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in a company that runs a website. At the core of the website there’s an algorithm serving a ML model and doing a bit of other things. Between the engineering and data science teams the collaboration is somewhat like: “Data scientists tell the engineers what they should do - and the engineers have to implement it.” I worked in both data science and engineering and found both positions frustrating. In engineering you don’t own the product, and in data science you’re not allowed to change the code. 
 Is this industry standard? How do you operate between engineering and data science in your companies?

 I've looked at some and they seem to be geared towards people from maybe a science background but even some from humanities. Looking at some of the Maths and Stats classes material I'd be wasting my time redoing a lot of my undergrad and probably just bored, I really struggle to motivate myself in this environment so would be a waste of my time and that place someone else might thrive in.
 Looking for recommendations of grad schools, programs which are geared more towards people coming from math heavy majors. Or that are at least accommodating of students who would want to study across different departments, say CS and Statistics or even CS and Engineering.
 Seems a lot of places have just rushed together data science masters and aren't too polished. I'd be happier just doing a straight up CS or Stats masters as long as they school would let me study a broad range of topics from Stats and CS that are applicable to Data Science, even if some classes were unaccredited.
 Open to schools anywhere in the world but ideally US and Europe as I can work there without needing additional visas etc.

We have decided to do a quarterly forecast since for almost half of the items, there are multiple cells of empty data meaning months where we sold 0 amount of that item (the company sells the item in bulk so some of the items are not sold every month). We have used Prophet so far, but is there any other model I can use that will help me forecast the items with limited amount of data just like I mentioned above or a better forecasting method in general?

I have several friends who work as software engineers and have recently gotten into contracting after only working for a few years. From what they tell me, the money that they earn is ridiculously high and when I ask them about the experience needed they say it's not really that much. 
 Does this translate into Data Science? I have been thinking I might like to take a stab at looking for contracting work but am worried I have too little experience. I had always thought that to be a contractor you needed to be an expert with many years of experience. Is this not the case?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been working as a data scientist for a little over two years and have grown bored of my current job. I have have been considering switching jobs and using the opportunity to take a break for several months to travel. I joined my current job as a graduate before the global ecconomy took a bit of a dive so I'm concerned that it may take me a while to find another decent job when I return. Things are made a little harder by the fact that I am working abroad in europe and don't speak the language of the country I live in very well. So I would either need to find something fully remote or else something local which requires english (which isn't that uncommon here). 
 Would anyone care to enlighten me as to how long I should expect to spend looking for a new job before I could land one in the current job climate?

 I've been building an excel model the last days, and I'm very curious to see if anyone can provide input on whether this would be easier in Python (certainly feels like it).
 I have a set of mines producing an unrefined product with various grades of certain elements. For example: Mine A will produce 100 tonnes of Product A, which has 10% Cavorite and 17% Elementite. Mine B, on the other hand, will produce 50 tonnes of Product B, which has a production basket of 5% and 30% respectively. Prices of each product are high, so they should both be sold into t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: I think my question has been answered, and thank you to everyone who provided opinions and (most helpfully) personal experiences. I think the answers are
  
There's a nonzero chance I could end up in the kind of situation I'm afraid of
 Nobody's going to let me have NSA-level security clearance anyway, after saying I sympathize with Reality Winner, Edward Snowden, and Chelsea Manning, so it doesn't matter, anyway. 
  
I can live with this.
 Original post below: ------------------
 I'm seeing NSA jobs from time to time on LinkedIn. If that link doesn't load (firewall? personalized?), the job is "Data Scientist - Entry to Expert Level (Maryland Location)".
 The job description seems like a good match for me, but... um... I have a strong conscience, I guess is the problem. I sympathize with people like Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning, and Reality Winner. If I were in their shoes--that is, working for the government and discovering illegal or unconstitutional or just anti-humanitarian shenanigans--I'd feel at least some need to try to fix the issue, not just go along.
 What's the likelihood of that?
 Please only answer if you have some knowledge of the NSA, other classified data science work for the US government, or some other relevant experience or knowledge. I'm not interested in comments like "The NSA is evil, what do you expect?" or "I'm sure our proud nation would never put you in that situation." Those don't help so much.
 Anyone with insight about this? I'd be happy to help stop terrorism or project trends in Pakistan's infrastructure or track Russia's spy program or whatever. I would very much not like to create models to target dissidents, tap citizens' phones, etc.

I oversee building projects involving Data Science across all Engineering and non-Engineering functions. My UX researcher would like to better understand Data Science and asked me for some resources that would be worthwhile for a non-practitioner. Resources like Data Science for Dummies have crossed my mind, but they too seem geared towards people wanting to pick up Data Science. I would appreciate any recommendations. I learned the basics ages ago and I don't consider myself a good resource for beginner resources for practitioners anymore, let alone for people outside of tech. The wiki mentions this resource I'll pass on https://www.boozallen.com/s/insight/publication/field-guide-to-data-science.html. Any other recommendations please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, as the title says, I am searching for a Data Analyst role in UK from past 3 months now.
 I have 4 years of experience as a Data Analyst, albiet from India(I believe that hardly matters?), and in small firms. I have done majority of my work in Power Bi, Excel, Sql(advance competency in all 3) and a bit of Python(pandas, scikit), ETL, Developing Data pipelines.
 Apart from this I have a very decent understanding/working knowledge of other skills like ML, Big Data, Azure which was mostly taught in my Msc Data Science course in the UK. As stated above, I've been trying to get into a Data Analyst role since September (after uni) and having an extremely hard time to even make it past the application stage. Approximately I might have applied for a good 300+ jobs and only got about 10 interviews in total.
 I have made my cv specifically in a way that it highlights my hard,soft skills and have keyworded PYTHON, SQL etc stuff to make it past auto-screening.
 Can anyone with a solid understanding of UK market tell me what's wrong in my skillset/what am I lacking? I would understand that getting into a senior role is difficult but I am applying mostly for junior roles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! :) I'm working on a random forest predictive model that predicts a binary label, in my case whether a customer has paid in advance or not. I have the following attributes:
 date, article code, product name, producer, unit price , sales quantity, customer id, county, payment habits.
 ​
 The process involves normalization (Z transform) (unit price, quantity), cross-checking and parameterizing of the data.
 ​
 I tried several different methods / setting the parameters, however i always get nearly the same results. Is this normal? What can I do to improve results: accuracy about 75%, recall weighted 51%, precision weighted 58%.
 ​
 I'm not sure whether what I am doing is right or wrong.
 ​
 How can performance be improved? Any suggestions?

But it's very hard to have a 30,000-foot view of this. I am trying to find a list, like those crowdsourced awesome lists in GitHub based on a subject, with "all" these implementations, but haven't found a centralized thing with that info yet.
 Examples: http://avatarai.me, https://www.summarize.tech, https://summarybox.com etc
 EDIT: I found this https://topstartups.io/?industries=Artificial%20Intelligence, but doesn't include small projects with potentially big impact like avatarai.
 Know more?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI technology has become incrementally better since its inception. The quality of generative AI output has now come to the point that is meaningfully good for creators and businesses. For instance, before 2020, the majority of use cases of AI (or rather traditional AI) were in spam detection and translation. That has changed now. More and more creators and marketers are using generative AI outputs for writing emails and promotional blogs. For writing that requires more creativity, generative AI outputs are already being used as first drafts, which for the time being, require further refinement. Leading US-based VC firm Sequoia Capital estimates that as the generative AI models are further improved, the technology will be able to write final drafts as good as if not better than, professional writers by 2030. 
 Some investors are likening generative AI to the early days of the web, seeing it as a transformative platform shift. US-based VC firm Sequoia sees generative AI as a technology that could generate trillions of dollars of economic value. As the demand for AI-powered content generation accelerates, generative AI start-ups have been garnering significant VC attention despite a broader slowdown in the pace of VC funding. Jasper, an Austin-based start-up, recently raised $125 million in Series A funding at a $1.5 billion valuation. London-based Stability AI also raised $101 million in an oversubscribed round, with investors like Coatue and Lightspeed Venture Partners participating. In May, Hugging Face also raised $100 million in a Series C round at a valuation of $2 billion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The small R&D company I work at has been conducting its data science by placing all of our projects into Github repositories (hierarchal nested folders) and then mapping out the structure of these projects using Notion (info statements explaining what each script is, names and locations of databases, explanations of how the scripts and databases relate to one another, etc.). However, it's becoming increasingly difficult to manage and keep track of everything as the number and scope of our projects increase. 
 Consequently, we are ideally looking for an organizational system that would allow us to be able to easily visualize the structure and details of projects, standardize how everything is recorded, trace out our work with clarity (for recordkeeping and replicability purposes), store away metadata on all the different moving parts of our project, and generally just maintain a good sense of what's been created and where things are at. These best idea we've come up with so far is pairing up a flow-chart software with a well-structured Notion document, but we'd like to ideally minimize the complexity and number of moving pieces here.
 How are other data science teams organizing and structuring their work? Of course, I understand this probably varies drastically based on the nature of one's work, but I'd love to hear anything and everything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm currently a data science manager at a large tech company (non-FAANG, but 'close' in terms of some more or less stupid metrics), with 10+ years of experience in different DS/ML areas. For various reasons including wanting to get out of the routine of the SV treadmill, desiring to travel more, etc I have been considering quitting and starting my own consulting gig. I am very well aware of the difficulties getting clients (and lots of reddit posts about it) , and tbh I'd be fine with a substantial reduction in my income, if that would be connected to a substantial improvement in my WLB and variety of projects.
 My question for folks that have been doing this, either at large Big4 type companies, or with their own firm is: what is generally your deliverable for clients? A pipeline in AWS/GCP? Notebook with analysis? 'Recommendations' for an internal team?
 Is it always one-off work ? Or do you train people to maintain your deliverables? 
 My experience in 'big tech' is that generally systems are so embedded that maintenance is a huge effort, so I'd love to hear perspective of folks working in consulting areas. Any high-level, anonymzed description of projects you have been working on would be incredibly valuable.
 Thanks in advance to anyone that might help me out understanding here.

 So I am wondering, what is in your opinion the minimum complexity to match the definition of a "complex" SQL query?
