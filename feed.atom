        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I have an internship where we do auditing and they want to use my statistics background to help better detect “inappropriate” spending. 
 And honestly I have no idea what to do going forward. Everyone there is accountant and a few economics background. But no one with a statistics or math background to my knowledge. 
 So basically they have given me a list of every audit they have done for the last ten years. And want me to find a way to help them choose vouchers to audit that are more likely to be inappropriate. 
 I have a bunch of data, the vendor, the payments amount, how long did they look at the voucher before they approved it. And everything you can think of. I just have no idea the best method to use. I was just thinking of doing logistic regression, but I don’t know if you guys have any better suggestions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! Quick introduction, I am 17 years old and currently in highschool looking to graduate probably within march or April. I've been exploring my future career options and what stuck out to me in particular was data science/ analysis. Now again a quick run down on what I did during the last 2 years, I opted for subjects that were related to commerce and computer science (so economics, Business, CS etc). I actually have a particular interest in computers and coding and so along with the python and SQL we learned in school I also know the basics of C++ and Java. My advanced math skills (calculus, integration etc) arent the best however, I do seem to do well in statistics and probability which I assume is pretty important for such a career.
 ​
 Now coming to my main question, do you think Data Science is a viable career? From what I can see, it seems almost too perfect. But I would like more insight. Is there something I am missing? Is the pay as good as other IT jobs? Is the demand for Data scientists high or will it get/remain high in the future once I get out of college? Is the job any fun (my biggest fear is ending up with a career that I dont enjoy or is depressing as hell)?
 Thanks

 I have not yet had to actually use a REST API to connect to a system to query data. My boss is basically asking me to learn and explore this option for FRESHDESK. We have/use Freshdesk for folks to work on tickets.
 I need to understand where to start. What tools to use? How to schedule a pull once a day, etc. Again, sorry for sounding like a novice but a lot of the YouTube videos are way too broad and don't exactly match up with what I need to do. 
 Do I have to use Python? Like I'm so lost. Any help would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Comic Code is a monospaced adaptation of Comic Sans. Designed specifically for programming, which is a corner of typography that involves intensive typing that feels more akin to handwriting than typesetting, this typeface took inspirations from the friendly characteristics and low-resolution legibility of Comic Sans. It is an unapologetic admittance of the positives of the source design, and a literal manifestation of “code like nobody’s watching”. Comic Code only takes inspiration from Comic Sans and was drawn entirely from scratch, in case you are wondering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, I’m employed as a data scientist, but primarily manage small teams and work with management on data strategy. It’s not an optimal layout, but I’m enjoying this, “management / strategy” aspect. 
 I might not be perfectly equipped to apply for data science manager roles, so I’ve come to ask for a your opinion. 
 What are your thoughts on the data science manager position: what skills are necessary, how does it differ to senior data science positions, and any personal experiences?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working with a time series project, trying a lot of differente models/methos and currently struggling with a probably simple question that I couldn't find an answer.
 Right now I am using a simple regression model, being Current Month Sales the target variable, and Lag Sales from last 12 months my independent variables.
 I thought that I should split my train/test dataset in a "timeseries" way, that is: X first months for train, Y last months for test.
 Should I really do that ? knowing that I am working in a regression model. Or can a simple train_test_split work in this situation ?
 ​
 This question came up beacause right now I am planning to do some GridSearch and it requires a CV.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I don't know if this is a standard way od doing things so open to any suggestions, basically I have done random sampling from my population to create 2 groups Treatment & Control. I also have few dimensions for these 2 groups like gmv, qty_sold. I want to perform paired T- test to check if the 2 groups are similar across these 2 dimensions, I have a suspicion that there may be few outliers who ight cause the group means to differ, is there any way to identify such outliers if my T test leads me to reject null-hypothesis ? I want to ensure that these 2 groups are similar if not I can remove the outliers and then check again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you deal with changing features in a regression problem? I imagine this is quite common in a product/marketplace company. Here's an example:
 Let's say the task is predicting car prices for an online marketplace, a value you'd like to present to someone about to list their car on the site. You can use your marketplace's historic sales as a training set. However, as the marketplace evolved, more features were added to the car object, and maybe some stopped being used. E.g., in the early phase of the marketplace, you had 3 features: car model, year, and color. Then maybe later on the company stopped collecting color, and instead now collect MPG and transmission type. So now you have 4 features on the newer dataset: car model, year, MPG, and transmission type. And so on and so on...did you just impute the missing values? not use features that are missing data? Split test/train to only reflect current features? Is it a constant game of cat and mouse keeping up with the fresh features?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI, another version of the i-life. At least Apple put i-first. Actually, how about anti-i-life? Here, following the operation left to right, you’re operated on first. No thanks, not interested. In many ways your intelligence is already anti (negated) by those with power over you. AI represents a terminal point of the technocracy. AI is the antithesis of sovereign individual intelligence.
 Technology platforms are committing entire categories to AI, medium included. AI is all around us, as if being forced onto us. It honestly feels coercive. We are in the middle of a bubble right now, well, maybe more like a quantum foam. We’ve been automating processes since the industrial revolution, automation is nothing new. You have nothing to worry about, well maybe your job if you work in tech (I’m sure you’ve seen the news).
 Do you honestly think all of this has arisen out of the pure intellectual curiosity of the masses? No, this obsession is being forced upon us by those seeking to ride this wave of investment dollars as long as they can. People are being paid to write about AI. The goal is to captivate the mind while convincing you there is simply no point in resisting. They seem to suggest you should take your own intellect and multiply it by negative one. The message appears something like: “Trust it because you’re not even intelligent enough to trust in your own intelligence.”
 Tech is stagnating and the Metaverse is gasping for breath. We are in the beginning stages of a re-quantization of human prioritization. Surely you’ve heard of The Great Reset. Well, what’s the point in resetting a system only to get the same outcome? I think we need A Great Re-quantization. A movement of individual thought.

 How often do you use a t-test to compare means? ANOVA (simple or more advanced versions)? Goodness of fit (of some variety)? Linear regression? Multivariate linear regression? Perform an analysis of model fit using some information criterion? Other advanced statistical methods?
 The purpose of the question is to decide on what is the ideal list of (advanced) statistics topics a data scientist should know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, is there any AI created that can analyze the spectral form of a given audio sample and then it tries to generate VST virtual instrument by listening to that sample so that the virtual instrument has a similar color to that instrument in an audio file? for example, I give AI this audio sample of the instrument:

 Then it tries to recreate an instrument in DAW that has a similar spectral form so that it sounds similar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR - Boss wants evidence, outside a portfolio of work, that I am knowledgeable enough for a DS title/pay change. Looking for suggestions.
 ​
 I'm currently a senior level analyst, and perform a decent amount of "Datascience" work already. I am 100% self-taught though, so my portfolio and resume don't exactly line up.
 Recently my boss and I discussed a title/pay change from Sr Analyst to Datascientist [or something akin to that], and he wanted a quick "proof of knowledge" that he could show to upper-management/HR for approval.
 The way he talked about it, it sounded like he was looking for a certificate (company paid for) or some other program that provides a "proof of knowledge". I'd like to do this the honest/"right" way, so ideally I'm looking for something that's not just handed out to anyone with a little Tableau/SQL experience.
 ​
 Any suggestions? Since the company is paying for it, I'd be game to hear suggestions for moderate/advanced courses that are helpful too!
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I'm currently in quite the Dilemma regarding data science/analytics internships. For reference I am currently a rising junior attending a large state university Studying Economics with minors in Statistics and Mathematics. I've been fortunate enough to intern in an Analytics/Modeling role at a large fortune 50 insurance company and also have DevOps experience at a lab.
 Recently though I've been applying to summer 2023 internships and was able to get multiple offers at several large companies. I've narrowed down my offers to two different companies which I will briefly describe.
 Company 1: Large Fortune 500 Banking/Credit firm, located on the east coast, with a high 'prestige' name. Pure Data Analytics Internship (Dashboards, Reporting, SQL, Automation, ETL, etc).
 Company 2: Medium Sized Car Automotive group, located near my current university, offering a pure Data Science Internship (Focus in pricing, loans and credit modeling)
 Ideally I would love to work in Fintech moving forward which is one of the main reasons Company 1 stands out. However moving to Company 1 would be a pain regarding location as I would have to travel across the nation.
 Additionally the experience I could gain at Company 2 seems great, there business model relies heavily on the data science team to develop production level models. Further I've met the team I would be working with and could tell I could learn a ton from them.
 I am aware that the prestige I could gain from Company 1 would be immense, however I am weary to chose the role just because I'm worried it will only lead to more data analyst internships down the line (which I would ideally like to avoid).
 Further, I'm very passionate about ML/econometrics/statistics and although I understand and appreciate the power of pure analytics, I'm worried I could see myself getting bored in a strictly analytics based role.
 I would really appreciate any input or thoughts!

 I am an Irish Data Scientist sitting in Kranidi with my fiancée and soon to be mother and father in law. There are many cats here - and I am a cat lover and father of two lovely domestic short hairs. I tried to pet this lovely cat but she was too skittish, but I did snap this picture. My soon to be father-in-law (STBFIL) is a brilliant interventional cardiologist and he believes this is a Ghost Cat. 
 I slightly believe this but my education calls me to reason that this image is using multiple pictures and the phone is programmed to use a summation function over the pixels between images to sum the vectors and make it appear that the cat is transparent. I promise that the cat is not behind the glass! I know this from seeing the cat before taking the picture and remembering the event well. What do you think? Does anyone have an explanation for me and my STBFIL?

 Specific Clubs? Specific Skills? Specific Networks? 
 Lastly, what do you consider to be the hardest skills to "learn" or "teach" that someone should possess before considering this field
 Do you think Data Science requires a specific "type" of person? Or do you think anyone could do what you do with enough time and practice?
