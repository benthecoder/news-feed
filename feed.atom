        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I want to model a board game using a graph having 21 vertices (squares on the board) and 62 edges (connections between the squares).
 I have a starting vertex, but no destination : I just need to visit 8 specific vertices, knowing that I can only go to a vertex that is adjacent to any one I've already visited.
 I want to find the optimal "path" so to speak (or set), that will make me visit all mandatory vertices, with the lowest possible total number of vertices visited.
 I think I'll have, along the way, to reduce to 0 the cost of going from one visited vertex to another adjacent that's also been visited.
 Unfortunately I don't really see how to wrap my head around this problem, would you guys have any idea ?
 Thanks a lot in advance !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I imagine we're all familiar with this formula:
 zi = (xi – min(x)) / (max(x) – min(x)) 
 I inherited a pipeline that is ingesting data and feeding a table that has roughly 35M rows and a derived column that is min-max scaling a given feature. However, the minimum bound of this vector has been dropping lower and lower to the point that the existing value in the table is no longer accurate. How would you address this once we've recalibrated the existing values to the new scale but expect min(x) to continue to drop?
 We don't have an idea of how much it will drop, just that it will continue to reduce.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently a research scientist and a term that's increasingly getting thrown around is 'neural differential equations' - which combine artificial neural networks with systems of differential equations (check out https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02435 if you want to know more). 
 I want to know if any working data scientists use a combination of DS with differential equations in their work? It's possible that for now, this combination is confined to academia, but it looks like it'll be exciting when applied to the industrial realm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently work as a data scientist/engineer in the cyber security domain. I basically manage data pipelines into pre built analytics and models all day.
 Anyway I learned a long time ago that getting paid in this field is about skills and domain knowledge. Building a solid track record in cyber and I have good industry contacts. I have zero passion for it. I would like to change domains(still be in data) without dramatically sacrificing salary growth. 
 How would you switch into a new domain. I have/will have degrees in comp sci and data science.

Our mission is to make the world's code safe, performant and reliable. We're starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.
How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.
We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor and Google.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Michael and Yury here – we're building a no-code analytics platform for growth teams that automatically generates actionable data insights.
After working in the data space for many years, we realized there was still a huge gap in the marketing analytics market. Growth teams have so much marketing and advertising data, yet this siloed data is not actionable.
The existing BI and search-driven analytics solutions are designed for data-savvy people. In our experience (previously built an NLP company called FriendlyData), non-technical people just don't know what questions to ask.
So we decided to try a different approach: Narrative BI automatically generates a personalized feed of insights. You just need to connect your data sources (takes 2 min to set up), and you will get automated narratives, alerts, and reports in minutes.
We currently support UA, GA4, Google Ads, and Facebook Ads, but many more integrations will be added soon.
You can try it out for free and give feedback or roast it in the comments section. Just connect your data source, and you'll start getting narratives in 5 minutes.

If I wanted a quick hand estimate of prices per each geographic lane what would be the best model to use? My initial reaction is to create some kind of pricing index per each sub region (or nationally) then use historical data to get to a baseline, adjust the baseline with most recent pricing index to get an estimate. Does that make sense? Thanks in advance for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As most know Github released its AI coding tool Copilot last year. It framed the tool as a “pair programmer” - able to help (not replace) programmers in the coding process. 
 I came across a study they performed across 2,000 programmers which found:
  
88% of users reported being more productive
 74% responded focusing on more satisfying work
 88% reported faster completion
  
They also performed a test with approx. 100 participants where they split them into groups to complete a project. 
  
Those using Copilot completed the project in 1 hr 11 minutes 
 Those going solo completed in 2 hrs 41 minutes
  
Seems positive for the concept of AI helping talented individuals get better and faster. This could apply to the other areas AI is rushing into this year (copywriting, other creatives). 
 Any thoughts?

 What constitutes a quality job? If you were to ask family and friends, they would probably say good pay, benefits, and stable working conditions, but for many workers, workplace technologies, especially AI, are affecting job quality.
 That’s important because the U.S. has a serious job quality problem. The number one ESG challenge companies are grappling with is the treatment of workers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have encountered several references to labeling training data through automation. This seems circular to me. If I have an automated process capable of applying my target label, why do I need a new model? Isn't my labeler already classifying the input? Won't a machine learning model trained on that data just be trying to approximate the labeler?
 I've tried to Google this, but all I can find seems to be pitches about how much cheaper it is than manual labeling

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am creating an audio processing tool with the end goal being able to process a song, and locating the melody from the audio. Currently, I am getting the samples of a track (Samples are the time domain representation of an audio file or amplitude over time). This looks something like this when plotted:

 What you are looking at is a drum beat extracted from an audio track. In this example, I have an array of 71,424 samples, which is only about 2 seconds in this case. In a 30 second track, you are dealing with millions of samples per track, so handling the data can be costly. As you can see from above the samples are ranging from around -1 to 1. How could I use this data to find similarities to another track?

Does anyone have information on diversity internships that I could apply for for the upcoming summer/winter?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hear people tout all the time how great package management is in R and how Python packages are a complete disaster/oen of the reasons R can be considered better than Python, but I've never actually run into an issue where a Python package installation had 1) an endless litany of unfilled dependencies that pip itself did not properly resolve or 2) where a package failed to install/use the correct version of a dependency.
 With R I frequently run into issues (even with dependencies = T) where:
  
I try a simple installation of a package.
 That installation fails because multiple dependencies failed
 Those dependencies failed to install because they are missing their own dependencies or worse, they require an uncommon library that cannot be installed within R (i.e. Requires a sudo apt-get install command). Sometimes these are so numerous that tracking down everything that failed and why is a nightmare.
  
These certainly happen with Python but they don't happen in multiple layers of nonsense quite so often as with R. I feel confident that 95% of my projects would go fine just using pip, but I think I'm going to exclusively let conda manage my R installations, because it can be absolutely maddening trying to rely on R's built-in package management.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company hired 1 junior data scientist right out of school and said, "ok do data science" lol. None of their work has provided value up to this point because it hasn't been productionalized or the model they worked on was not aligned to any business prop or value. This person still has much to learn and doesn't seem to be taking any initiative in coming up with data science processes for future dev. 
 ​
 Here are my questions:
  
Would you hire a senior data scientist to then teach this person? Or would you let them go until your company was ready to invest some time into the whole data science life cycle
 If you would keep them, what processes would you put in place to help them get the data science initiatives working and actually providing value?
  
EDIT: I’m not the manager to all those who assumed. I’m on the same team and am somewhat of a bystander to everything that is happening
