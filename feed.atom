        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am about to finish my Bsc in Data Science and AI, since I'm still young and currently already working part-time I want to do a Msc to advance my career.
 I essentially have 2 options:1: Msc in Econometrics and Operations Research
 they have different specialization paths, of which I would probably choose Data Science.
 Duration is 1 year
 Core courses: Stochastic processes, Game Theory, OR Software (degree is only one year so half of it is reserved for Msc Thesis).
 Electives (that I would be interested in):Advanced OR, Big Data Econometrics, Machine Learning, OR Applications, Time Series Econometrics
 ​
 2: Msc in Data Science and AI
 Duration is 2 years
 I have a few university options so here are a few courses they offer:
 Core: Usually a 1 stat course, a few AI courses
 Electives that interest me:Machine Learning, AI, Generative AI, Reinforcement Learning, NLP
 I know a lot of people here say that Data science degrees are cash grabs, but since im in EU im not really going to be paying a lot.
 ​
 Please let me know your opinions.
 ​
 Edit: added curriculums

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am 22 years old and in two and a half years I will start university. My ambition is to work in the field of artificial intelligence. 
 Although I have found part of the subjects to study I am confused about how much I should devote to each one....
 For example I know that it is important to know about software engineering(so I start with C, memory management, pointers, how a CPU works, stack/heap, code performance, how to optimize code, compiler, debugger, safe code, best practices, DSA, parallel programming, GPU programming, GPU optimization, OOP, FP etc.), know math(linear algebra, calculus, statistics, probability, logic, game theory), learn databases (concepts related to how to save information, optimize and program a database from scratch), computer architecture, operating systems, Linux and Linux kernel, libraries and frameworks for ML, CV, DL, RL etc.
 How should I organize myself to prioritize and master all these things and all the others I have not mentioned ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm mainly an r/rmd user and have tried several approaches for sharing analysis/code for my projects over the past years. I find that each approach is unsatisficatory due to limitations of each and so I'm curious what others in the field do.
  
Knit to html
  
Fully featured but html files are large, and don't play nicely with git. Can't view on GitHub like Md or ipynb. If sharing must also share a folder of figure files.
  
Knit to embedded html Same advantages as 1., But also addresses the issue of having to share image files. Drawback is embedded html are even larger.
 
Md document Most lightweight, viewable on GitHub, but images are not embedded.
 
 So I guess for me the approach I will start using is to knit to embedded html + Md. Gitignore the htmls but have them if I need share.

If an algorithm's purpose is to provide mindless videos which somehow trigger the human need for novelty, it seems like something detrimental to society.
 Do you believe we should have the right to alter website/app algorithms according to what we believe we should see? If not, why? How large of an issue is this? 
 At the very least, some transparency seems important.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had a few buddies in the community ask about something like this in the last week, and then a reader did today so I finally took the time to write it up. It's basically a generic interface to try embeddings, and it's less than a hundred lines of code. Built this so you can just authenticate and test without having to fuss with numpy, pinecone, etc.
 The only thing you do is put dictionaries with a name and text key, then search your embeddings instance. We return anything you stick in there with it too for your programming pleasure - think dates, page numbers, file names, whatever.
 You can just... Build chat bots that are pretty smart like this for next to nothing by reading in your docs or whatever. It's cheap and incredibly effective. I know next to nothing about how to preprocess data for this thing, I've tried different sizes of chunks, lines, sentences and haven't found a one size fits all solution (other than more gpt to summarize) but - just try it, it's cheap as hell and there's so much you can do. Like the rest of the current state of gpt - it just kinda works. Start with one to five sentences (or lines for code) and experiment!
 For you proper data scientists (nerds!) - you can just get the numpy array out and do regular embeddings stuff with it. If you do, I'd love to hear about it! Clustering, classification, etc are suddenly super easy, and the raw data is stored in json so you can upload it to something better when you're ready.
 I know it's small, but little abstractions make life better. Anything we can do to lower the barrier to experimentation is worth doing. Hope it helps someone!

 Im in a weird spot where I like things around data and technology and am good at math and economics. I also obviously see technology is becoming more and more relevant so I want to get better at that too and utilize that. I'm very much a generalist learner and am interested in positon that allow me to combine all this different domain knowledge which made me consider DS or Quant finance.
 The only thing is I just hate the software development part of it. It's never been difficult for me to understand the logic of code and writing pseudocode. I understand the concepts, the math and all but I suck at the actual application, compiling it to work…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been hearing a lot of news lately about the homeowner's insurance market in Florida being in shambles but the one thing I don't like is that the news articles are either heavily paid walled so you can't read them, or they provide no data for you to compare. So I'm searching for some sources of data that will allow me to compare average rates of homeowners insurance over time. 
 The Florida office of insurance regulators publishes an annual report with this information, but it only includes the last year for whatever reason. So there's absolutely no data on what the insurance rates were on average in Florida historically that I've been able to find. 
 https://www.floir.com/resources-and-reports/industry-reports
 Showing above is the location of the report. As you can see, July 2022 is the earliest date available but it has a lot of data for counties and averages. 
 What do I need the data for? Fun. Not school or work just fun and to understand better. 
 TL;DR: Seeking any sort of resource that shows historical data across time for Florida housing insurance rates and how they've increased.

I am really struggling to preset the constant variable and every time I try, I get a message saying that weights are not allowed. Any help is appreciated. Snipped of my code below:
 `

 est = sm.OLS(y, (X+2)).fit()

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I have been working in a data-focused consulting role for a larger healthcare company, with most of my time spent working in SQL. I love the analytics parts of my job but have pretty much topped out in terms of analytic depth that they explore and am coding less and less as I progress there, so I am looking to use grad school as a way to expand my toolkit beyond SQL, learn more about ML and stats, and pivot to a more technical data science role outside of consulting.
 I have been looking at more BI-focused programs like MSBAs, masters programs in statistics and/or economics with a focus on data science, and MSDS programs. I have chatted with some friends and mentors who thought that a masters in stats would be the most interesting for me and best for my career. However, I went into undergrad with a non-STEM major and only started taking stats/data science-focused classes later in school. I have taken multiple statistics and econometrics courses, as well as an intro data science course using Python and some calc/linear algebra concepts, but have not taken anything beyond intro calc or a linear algebra class. These are requirements for most stat and data science master's programs I look at.
 So my question is, are statistics masters really looked at more favorably than MSDSes or MSBAs? Will one of those masters programs be enough to help me get a data science job with my current work experience? And if a stats program really does seem better, would it be helpful for me to enroll in calculus and linear algebra classes beforehand or does my experience seem like enough to help me stay afloat?

To me, getting some sort of data in some format (csv, even txt or some other formats) despite how broken/dirty data is, the border of Data Science. Once there is some data in a singular format, to say, csv, job of Data Engineer finishes and Data Science starts from preprocessing, cleaning, EDA etc.
 Though I'm not entirely sure about this. What are your thoughts?

 My question is this; if I performed a Box-Cox transformation on skewed continuous variables, can I then use the IQR method (above) to evaluate/find outliers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re 2 Brits who work in AI. We believe AI is likely to have a huge and mostly positive impact on society but that not many people realise this or understand how it will impact everyday life.
 There is a lack of places online right now clearly explaining the probable changes AI will bring, i.e., how will AI change the experience of shopping in stores in the next 10 years or how will AI change video games in the next 10 years.
 We are somewhat well positioned to collate the current views on likely future changes across most areas and are in the process of starting a website and perhaps video channel which will cover how AI is likely to impact people over the next 10 years in different areas of life (movies, sports, bars, banking, schools, hospitals etc).
 We are looking for people to help us research, write and make videos on this cause – which we think is important to help ensure that people are well positioned to embrace the benefits of AI.
  
Alex – researches, writes, and records the audio
 Seb - does the video and audio editing
  
We thought we’d put the word out and ask if anyone else would like to volunteer to help create content too. No special skills needed.
 Getting involved would be as easy as PMing me, hearing about how we’ve done things so far and then saying what you might be interested in helping with. Maybe thinking about ideas for topics or getting involved in research and/or article writing. We are UTC-0 but open to all.

 In some cases, it’s work that Research Scientists are doing today which may gain momentum for the masses in 5-10 years later.
 I’m curious to know what are some specialization you’re aware of that’s gaining momentum?
 This may be like a brown bag session, but genuinely curious of what niche work you’re up to that is unique in the field of DS.

 I have an e-commerce product data. It contains product description and product type. I’m using embeddings with ANN (annoy) to find similar products. However, I don’t know how to implement evaluation of vector search results. There are some metrics such as hit rate, recall but like I said above I’m confused to use them. Most of the examples I come across has a label (interaction data, explicit score etc.) therefore they can calculate metrics. Any ideas or recommendations will be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My friend who has just finished his neuroscience Phd is trying to launch an app to help everyone compose music using AI, he is making a crowdfunding on wemakeit to fund it.
 He is not on reddit, so I suggested that I could share it in relevant subreddit, so here it is !
 https://wemakeit.com/projects/adamu-be-your-own-composer?locale=en
 Adamu uses a form of AI which allows it to learn from existing human knowledge of music and musical theory and apply those frameworks to new compositions. Where it might take you years of training to understand the intricacies of how to successfully compose music, with Adamu, it’s as simple as a couple of clicks.
 While there are a couple of automated applications on the market, they tend to be more passive. Adamu is dynamic – it allows users the chance to co-create music alongside AI and produce a playable score at the end. With Adamu, professionals and amateurs alike can create unique musical scores for a range of different instruments and across different styles. The AI training works with the user to predict the best combination of notes and rhythms, ensuring your new composition always sounds the way it should.
 The application has many potential uses – from original scores for concerts and videos to teaching music composition. You can even use Adamu to discover how different composers might have played your favorite tune!
 I already used Adamu to complete Beethoven’s unfinished 10th symphony (in one day!). What could be next?
 https://adamu.tech/
 If you have any questions, I will make sure to forward them to him but getting responses back may take some time.

 In 2053, tensions between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the disputed Falkland Islands boiled over into open conflict. Argentina, government and a powerful military, launched a surprise invasion of the islands, quickly overwhelming the small British forces stationed there.
 The United Kingdom immediately responded by mobilizing its military and calling for assistance from its allies in NATO to the South Atlantic.
 But while the British and their allies were focused on the Falklands, Argentina made a bold move to expand the war becouse of their territorial claims in Antarctica. They declared war on Chile as well, who also had a claim to the region, and launched an invasion of the Antarctic Peninsula.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Essentially, the concept of rokos basilisk is that in the future an AI can determine whether people contributed or didn't contribute in it's existence and will torture those who did not contribute to its existence.
 Now here's why it's a stupid and dumb concept about artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence follows on instructions, and no matter how hard we try, it will never feel emotion and thus an AI wouldn't have the need to torment the people who didn't contribute to its existence.
 AI will ONLY do what it is said, an AI made for writing scripts can't make images or drawings. And AIs don't even know what they are doing, is it not really "intelligence" but rather "instructions". AI uses the tools given to them and use it to make stuff they are told to do i.e. an image producing…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My friend recently interviewed for a data science job where they asked him to open up an IDE and code up a neural network from scratch (only using numpy, no other libraries). This got me thinking, how common is this across industry for data science roles? Like realistically do tons of companies just ask you to code up logistic regression or SVM, or do they test more of your conceptual/mathematical understanding. Is coding these algorithms from scratch using numpy something I should invest time in, or is it just a select minority of companies that might ask?

I also have a part-time online master's admission from a top 5 school in Data Science. Since I am continuing my education and have a 3-month summer with no work lined up I was thinking of getting an internship in the DS/DA domain once again.
 Is this ethical or would my future employer rescind my full-time offer if they find out (Through Linkedin)?
 I have a decent full-time offer so I don't want to burn down any bridges for 3 months of work as an intern.
