        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm enrolled in a fast-paced machine learning and AI class and approaching the end. For my capstone I need to train a model to evaluate driving video and determine the speed of the vehicle, where and what the roadsigns are, and the edges of the road. We're using tensorflow but I have a Radeon Rx 580 video card which does not have Cuda (so far I've been using my CPU only). Is there a decent technology to use my current GPU for tensor operations or should I be seriously considering swapping in a Nvidia RTX series card?

 I am building a model to predict customer churn in the medical device domain. I am trying RFM features and then training an ML model on top of it. As per research, this approach is a good start for existing customers, but not new ones. 
 Does anyone have experience building a customer churn model for existing and new customers? What approaches have you tried? Which all features can I engineer? I do have PHI data as it is a healthcare-related problem.
 Thank you in advance!

 I enjoy both DS and DE. My end career goal is to be a Chief Data Officer or some sort of data exec/leader/manager. Hoping to move from academia to industry after completing my MS. 
 I probably have more aptitude for DE (strong programmer compared to not so strong math/stats), but I worry that DE doesn’t have as much visibility for upward mobility. 
 I’m sure there is no rule, but which will lead to a leadership role quicker/easier: DS or DE?

 I am actively looking for a job for the past six months in Data Science related field but with no succes. 
 Everyday I learn about this field and I try to put my mind 100% into this but somehow I got no results (by results I mean a job).
 So my question is: on what should I put my time, learning everyday new things about data science and applying on jobs or working with my current knowledge to create a portofolio and then applying for the job?
 I just applied for a Master in CS, I have no prior education in this field. 
 Any response is much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there any AI that can compile several pictures of a person into a single, 3d version?
 Is there any available AI that can compile several pictures of a person into a single, 3d version? I am thinking something in the style of a NeRF but for persons who can be in different positions.
 The idea is to upload several pictures, but none frome the exact right angle, and create a great model for use.

I remember our machine learning teacher telling us that If we don't get all this theory behind then we better quit data science and go after something else.. However, when I do courses on LinkedIn Learning and Datacamp, they don't dig much into these.. I was wondering what should I focus on for now. I am more into working as a Data Scientist in the industry than pursuing research.

 Also If you have some beginner-friendly projects that I can work on to prepare myself for a career in Data Science please share them with me, I would be so grateful!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone
 ​
 I have a problem implementing haarcascade algorithm, which is the huge number of possible features. For example, for a mere 50×50 window the possible features exceed 3 million easily (the 5 known rectangle features, with all possible variations on width/height and position within the window).
 ​
 Is there any recommended way to prune/optimize this, say based on size? Is this how it's meant to be, or am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People say ai art is going to improve and possibly replace all mediums of art since the concept behind the creation of ai art is not that much different or will become no different than how humans produce art. However i've remember seeing this argument when it come to self-driving cars. People would say self-driving cars will replace truck drivers and the like in like 10 years, well it's been 10 years and it's no where near being the norm as it was hyped out to be. Read some articles, and it seems that self-driving cars have hit some road blocks. 
 So my question is, is ai art not going to hit the same road blocks as self-driving cars? Or a maybe some different type of barrier that might prevent it from being better like it's hyped out to be?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 Computer scientist here, but my experience with AI is admittedly limited to some under graduate courses. I haven’t really been keeping up on the developments, but let’s just say you guys have my attention once again.
 If you had asked me 2 weeks ago if we were approaching a technological Utopia, I would have bluntly told you “No”.
 However, the past two weeks have been quite an eye opener, and I am very impressed.
 It started with chat gpt, and open AI chatbots. Their capabilities are impossible to deny, and it will be disruptive technology moving forward.
 However, with the announcement of Nuclear Fusion Reactions being achieved.. I dug a bit deeper. Many of the diagnostic and laser control systems recently had huge improvements made on the back of AI.
 And again, today with the announcement of solid state battery breakthroughs, which with all likelihood also reached beyond decades old barriers on the back of AI.
 The past 2 weeks, feels like we may have gone to the moon 3 times, and I would be highly suspicious that they are all independent, isolated advancements in their own domains.
 Progress like this doesn’t come out of nowhere, and it really seems as if AI is that common thread pushing us past our previous boundaries.

 I'm working on a project and can't really figure out what the best approach is here. Effectively I have product sales for n=1,600 diff products over 24 quarters each, with each product having its own unique slope/curve over time (but certain categorical features of the products clearly tend to yield exponential decay curves, while other qualitative features yield more bell-shaped growth curves). I want to quantify -- with one variable if possible -- the nature of each product's curve, and identify which categorical features contribute to the exponential decay curves. Does anyone have any good direction for me here? Anything I should dig into/read?
 ​
 Thanks in advance

 I was recently given a job offer at a large corporation for $140k/yr + benefits + OT pay. However, this is a contractor position for 12 months. The position is a perfect fit for me in terms of expertise.
 I'm leaning towards taking the offer, but my family is saying that I shouldn't take it because its a contractor role.
 What does everyone think about this? Should I take the new position, or stick with my old one for now?
 Thank you for reading!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I obtained a BS in Statistics with a 3.8 gpa in May 2021, spent 9mo looking for a job, and have been in an entry level govt analyst position for another 9mo analyzing hourly traffic volumes visually. Currently, my job entails no math/programming and I'm not allowed to install anything on my computer without proving it's necessary for my job.
 I've never had an internship (pandemic grad), don't know SAS or SQL, have limited experience in Tableau/Power BI, and have absolutely no clue how to make the next step in my career (or what that even looks like). I'm wondering if DS is the right field for me at all because, despite good grades in college, navigating this career space doesn't make sense.
 Edit:
  
I took a course in Python and most of my coursework was in R
 At work, I inspect daily traffic volumes represented as 24hr line graphs and compare these graphs visually against past years. Basically, I pass/fail the data if it looks/doesn't look right, e.g. on a holiday where traffic is lower, if there is an accident and traffic slows, or if there's a malfunction with the equipment and it stops recording traffic accurately.
 I would love to leave my job for a position with career growth opportunities, but my income is necessary to cover my basic needs so I cannot leave until I find something better

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm a master student in data science and I'm currently working in a notorious company for an AI project. 
 They have offered me to continue such project with a PhD, which wasn't my plan initially, since I would have preferred to simply continue working. But the offer seems good, since I like the project.
 The project is in a field known as open-set recognition, also known simply as novelty detection. It isn't the most active field in research, but there are some interesting papers here and there.
 I now need to find a university professor to supervise me. and I have some questions that you may give me some useful insights on:
 - is an industrial PhD worth it? I may have some limitations concerning the amount of theoretical research I could carry, since the company, in the end, is interested in a finished product.
 - what should I look for in a supervisor?
 - is a PhD in the AI field truly needed? Or should I be better off working for a few companies during the next years and improving my engineering skills?
 I know that these questions are very person-dependent, but if you have any personal experiences that may help me, I would be glad to hear. Thank you :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been in the MLOps space for ~10 years, and data is still the hardest unsolved open problem. Code is versioned using Git, data is stored somewhere else, and context often lives in a 3rd location like Slack or GDocs. This is why we built XetHub, a platform that enables teams to treat data like code, using Git.
Unlike Git LFS, we don’t just store the files. We use content-defined chunking and Merkle Trees to dedupe against everything in history. This allows small changes in large files to be stored compactly. Read more here: https://xethub.com/assets/docs/how-xet-deduplication-works
Today, XetHub works for 1 TB repositories, and we plan to scale to 100 TB in the next year. Our implementation is in Rust (client & cache + storage) and our web application is written in Go. XetHub includes a GitHub-like web interface that provides automatic CSV summaries and allows custom visualizations using Vega. Even at 1 TB, we know downloading an entire repository is painful, so we built git-xet mount - which, in seconds, provides a user-mode filesystem view over the repo.
XetHub is available today (Linux & Mac today, Windows coming soon) and we would love your feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How should the odds ratios, p values and R2 values from logistic regressions be reported in scientific papers?
 If i were to apply a 10-fold cross validation, there'd be 10 sets of models trained by differet subsets of data, and therefore they'd have slightly varying results. I was told by a researcher friend to 'pick the best one' out of the 10 based on ROC curve. However, i have some reservations about this advise because it'd bias the results.
 I know the convention for comparing models with different parameters(e.g. different polynomial features or regularization) is to compare the average error or r2 score from their cross vals. Should this averaged r2 be the one to report?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I have a post graduate in information management and I'm trying to consolidate some learnings of the course by developing a project that in the future will serve to sell myself to my new future employer.
 The project consists in getting data from a government website that has all the contracts made by public companies, analysing that data, and in the end, trying to find suspicious contracts and this is where it gets trickier because I don't know exactly what I'm looking for. 
 I would like to see if it is possible to flag a contract as suspicious or not, based on Contract Value, Contract Type (mainly because some contracts can be done without public tender, under some circumstances) , Company names, etc but the truth is that I don't know exactly what is a fraud and what isn't so I don't actually have any training data.
 ​
 Is there any documentation that I can read about this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 a colleague of mine and I created a Framework for AI in Java that's designed to be easy to use and to be played around with. To be more specific it's a Machine Learning Algorithm that uses a Genetic Algorithm to train Neural Networks.
 Our initial motivation was to create some library/framework especially designed for people who learned Java in school/university and now want to try out there first steps in Machine Learning. Without the need of learning Python or super complex Java Libraries.
 This is not for companies who search a full product, this is for people who like to code for fun and just want something to play around with in the complex and packed AI-World. 
 Here is a tutorial using this framework to predict diabetes: https://easy-ml.gitbook.io/easy-ml-for-java/fundamentals/implement-your-first-ai 
 Please also look at the GitHub repository and leave some feedback about code and design. (Especially considering the ReadMe)
 https://github.com/tomLamprecht/Easy-ML-For-Java 
 Thanks so much!
 PS: we earn no cent with this project, and we just do it for the experience. So feedback is basically our payment :D

 I took another analyst role that ended up being a really bad fit; aside from a toxic work environment, my school of thought didn't mesh with my manager, and I was way more technically and methodically advanced than they were. When I interviewed for the position I tried to be as honest and straightforward as I possibly could be about my skills and career interests. I didn't pick up on any red flags during the interview process.
 I'm feeling pretty burned out and demoralized with my career path. I'm confident with my data chops, and would really like to avoid falling further down the pit of despair. What are some unassuming probing questions that I can ask a potential employer/manager to make sure the job is actually stable and provides opportunity for growth?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow redditors! 
 i am currently a little confused as to how can i improve my chances in DS. I graduated with a Master in Data Science and worked as an analyst before the recession wave hit me (and quite hard i must say). I have realized i have to work on my core technical skills (mostly i want to, as well) and for that, i need some guidance. 
 About me:
  
i have a background in retail and e-commerce consulting 
 i do NOT have an engineering/technical background -> not a programming pro 
 i'm considering a PhD in AI/ML (non-technical/business oriented)
  
What i need to be answered:
  
I want to know areas of ML/DS i can specialize in which have a good professional future. I'm thinking of NLP or Computer vision, but other suggestions would do too. 
 a plan for the next few months? 
 any suggestion that a confused starter like myself can benefit from

 useless question 2
 useless question 3

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continuing a previous blog post analyzing errors in popular LLM benchmarks (post on Google’s GoEmotions here) — I analyzed HellaSwag and found 36% contains errors.
 For example, here’s a prompt and set of possible completions from the dataset. Which completion do you think is most appropriate? See if you can figure it out through the haze of typos and generally non-sensical writing.
 Men are standing in a large green field playing lacrosse. People is around the field watching the game. men
  
are holding tshirts watching int lacrosse playing.
 are being interviewed in a podium in front of a large group and a gymnast is holding a microphone for the announcers.
 are running side to side of the ield playing lacrosse trying to score.
 are in a field running around playing lacrosse.
  
I’ll keep it spoiler-free here, but the full blog post goes into detail on this example (and others) and explains why they are so problematic.
