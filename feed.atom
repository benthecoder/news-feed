        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is this a reasonable interview coding question? ^ I was asked to code a perceptron from scratch with plain python, including backpropagation, calculate gradients and loss and update weights. I know it's a fun exercise to code a perceptron from scratch and almost all of us have done this at some point in our lives probably.
 I have over 2 years of work experience and wasn't expecting such interview question.
 I am glad I did fine though with a little bit of nudging given by the interviewer, but I am wondering if this was a reasonable interview question at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a data science project in an Indian ecommerce firm for the last one year. I have tried many different techniques and variations, however, I am yet to create a significant 'impact' according to my manager. Now as the days pass by, I am increasingly worried snd feel under a lot of pressure to get the project productionized. But I keep thinking this: what if it turns out to have no significant impact till the next few months?
 I talked to my manager about this, and even though he has assured me that I wont be laid off, that at the worst if the next few months the project does not yield any positive results and that I may be shifted to snother project, I am not sure of what should I do.
 Should I prepare for a possible layoff? Or should I plan to leave just in case this whole thing goes south? 
 Have you faced a situation like this wiht yoir career? What happened then? How sre such situations usually resolved?
 I am looking for people in senior positions, ones who have seen the landscape of this industry for quite some years to provide me advice on this. I am a fresher with around 2 years of experience. And I also have a master's in data science from one of the top government institutions in India. (Just giving out some details for context). Thanks

I know that SWE's will sometimes code up something they find useful for their everyday lives like automating tasks or making web apps for themselves that they find useful/fun, and I'm wondering if data professionals have something similar to that. 
 Like have you ever been pondering a question to yourself and decided to pull in some data to answer it?

Given this goal I was wondering if I should also be self-studying data analysis along with the math. I reason that this might be good since I'd be getting hands-on experience with data and I might even be able to do it as a job while I study.
 In my math studies I'm currently on Algebra 2 so if I should be learning data analysis, can I start learning it now or would it be better to start after I've learned more advanced math like calculus?

Having heard about a Data Scientist requiring to be knowledgeable in Probability and Statistics (here: https://imgur.com/gallery/jPlI6Yx .).I scrolled through my syllabus and found one paper to be Probability and Statistics and thought to learn :
 1: How good is the syllabus for different level of data scientist? (At least for being an entry level Data Scientist.)
 2: If it is not enough for an entry level Data Scientist job, then what else do I need to know atleast? 
 3: If it is more than what I would need to be an entry level Data Scientist, how much more is it, as in what level could it help me for? 
 I know negligibly about the Data Science field compared to you people and my english is not very we so if I have not made much sense, I would try to elaborate on whatever you would ask me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I get inaccurate information form ChatGPT when I ask questions in areas where I have a good bit of knowledge. I couple of times it has cited specific books or papers by title and author and, as far as I can tell, the books/papers don't exists. The second time it did this, I ask it why it makes this kind of odd mistakes and it said:
 "As a language model, my information is based on the text that I have been trained on, and I try to provide the most accurate and relevant information based on that data. However, I am not infallible and sometimes make mistakes or provide information that is inaccurate or out-of-date. I apologize for any inaccuracies in my previous responses, and for any confusion that they may have caused. It's important to know that the information provided by AI models like me should be taken as a starting point for further research and not as the final answer. It's always a good idea to consult with experts or verify information with multiple sources. Again, I apologize for any inaccuracies in my previous statements and any confusion they may have caused."
 But it is still weird that it would make up specific books and papers, I don't see why a language model would do that.
 Edit: Maybe the text that it is trained on references specific books and paper that don't exist. And I guess that would be text that are not indexed by Google and other places where I am doing my fact checking such that I cannot figure out where it is getting this stuff.

 Github: https://github.com/BurhanUlTayyab/GPTZero
 Website: https://gptzero.sg
 Discord: https://discord.com/invite/F3kFan28vH
 We're also working on a GPTZerov2 (inspired by LLM based transformers and GANs), which would be more accurate, and can detect lines changed by humans. 
 Please give some feedback on our work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There has been many advancements in especially in CV, NLP etc. But, I don't see many new AI models that are solving real world problems. There has been a lot of advancements in AI in RL, DL etc but I rarely see new applications in real world. All i see are text to image models, advanced chat bots, better game playing AIs etc. These are definitely amazing, but, I wanna see new stuff which is making a good impact on the real world. 
 Alpha-fold, driverless cars etc are sorta things I am looking for. 
 I don't know if I am just bluntly unaware of new stuff in AI which solves practical problems, or whether not much new stuff is happening in those areas. 
 So, I would be glad if I can know more about how AI is being used in new ways to solve real-wprld problems, or any new AI research trying to tackle a real world problem? 
 Sry if it's a stupid question, and sry for spamming "real world" too much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've used causal models to estimate average treatment effects for various questions. But I have not yet implemented any large scale model for individual treatment effects.
 There seems to be few people with experience and I have not found a good community for asking questions. So I thought I check out if we have people with experience here.
 Edit: I am especially interested if there are anyone that have been moving from standard classification/regression models to causal modeling.
 Edit2: I am not that interested in learning models or different techniques. I know what to read and where to look. I am looking for people who have implemented such models at large scale in a commercial setting. Some questions:
  
How was it going from classification models to causal models?
 What results did your organization observe?
 Have you been working with "scenario planning". Optimizing for revenue vs retention and similar.
 What type of models and problem did you work with?
 Have you been implementing it in a larger system, such as a decision hub?
  
And so forth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! Just for a bit of context, I am 23 years old and just started my Data Analyst career. I have not graduated with my bachelors yet but I believe over the summer I should be able to finish core req classes and should be golden.
 I currently have experience working with R, Tableau and Tableau Prep. I have been fortunate enough to work at a start up company and really gain a lot of exposure to other tools such as Heap and Salesforce. So far I have 8 months of experience.
 During these 8 months I have completed a series of deep analysis of the company products and its customers. Worked from analyzing customer behavior, after cleaning really messy historical data, to creating customer segments based on the key performance metrics I also had created. Using Heap, I had to define UI code of our plattforms to then make analysis of user interactions. Report those findings and suggest areas of improvement.
 I feel confident in cleaning data but, as its notoriously known, I do take my time because I don't like finding later mid-analysis that the data is off. Whenever I find myself repeatedly doing something on excel, I create executable R scripts to speed the process. I often do this when uploading data into Salesforce.
 I plan to read some amazing resources I found for ML and statistics and apply some concepts into the company. I found that this start up in particular is always open for new ideas and projects.
 My current goal is to shoot for $80k salary once I graduate, how realistic are these goals? I just dont know how much my experience is valued at the current market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, 
 I have a technical background and have studied some AI in the past. I'd like to catch up on the latest developments in AI over the last ~10 years.
 Do you have any recommendations on what to read? I was thinking of maybe trying to get the top most cited papers in the last 10 years and reading them. But I'm not sure where would be the best place to find that.
 Any suggestions?
 Thanks in advance.
