        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am 22 years old and attend an evening computer science high school made for adults who dropped out in their adolescence. I am currently just over 2 to finish it and will get my computer science diploma. After that I would like to enroll in college but I am undecided between statistics, computer science or artificial intelligence.
 Now, for this year I am tackling programming in C. But I am fascinated by the world of data and artificial intelligence. So I was thinking of starting training as a Data Analyst and then scaling up in positions until I reach my ambitions. 
 Is this a good idea ? Where should I start ? 
 I was thinking of starting by reading books that explain in a general way the world of data to get an overview and then continue by studying Linear Algebra, statistics and probability with the R programming language. Learning excel, SQL and tableau. Do you have any suggestions for me ? 
 Is C used in some way in the field of Data ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may like or dislike Tiktok based on it's content and style of delivering that content but I think everyone has to admit that technically it is quite the achievement.
It's video based and delivers video really well. It rarely buffers or fails to load. Compare that to the Reddit video player or the Twitter video player or Vimeo. It's much better. Netflix loads poorly initially for me quite a bit (granted it's trying to load much higher quality).
How did they manage to get the engineering talent when seemingly FB, MS, Netflix, Amazon, Google are all fighting for that talent?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently switched jobs from credit risk to marketing data science in a tech firm. In my previous role I build predictive models to predict risk, optimize lending strategies , fraud etc In my current I lead marketing strategy - so anywhere from customer segmentation ab testing, measurement, attribution lifetime value etc My current role is in tech and an IC role. It's a new role but overall I'm having an extremely hard time adjusting. The workstream is too new. There is minimal guidance from my manager and business stakeholders just make vague requests and ask me to figure it out. The volume of work is also so huge that I cannot complete one thing well
 I'm overwhelmed and sometimes feel like going back to my old employer. However in the interview process I realized credit experience is not valued. I see more jobs/opportunities in marketing DS
 Anyone who worked and exited banking/credit ? What do you do now? Which one is more better in terms of opportunities?

I described the merging and joining process, but since a part of the audience is non technical, I would like to provide a visualisation of my dataset generation. Anyone any idea for a cool tool or concept on how to do that? Will add you to the credits, promised! Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I was wondering if there’s any advice here on how to better my job search. I recently graduated from Uni in the US with a Bachelors in Data Science and neuroscience. I’ve been applying for roles for the past 9 months now. I’ve gotten 3 interview so far, zero offers. I’ve shown my resume to multiple counselors and professionals. And everyone says that it’s solid, yet it really doesn’t feel that way. I’ve probably applied to over 100 roles at this point. In terms of experience I have three internships under my belt. One was over summer. And two during my semesters at college. My grades were decent B+ average. Granted some of the roles I applied to were maybe a bit of a reach. But a lot of them that I felt like I qualified for I barely got pass the screening. At this point I’m considering a data entry role instead of an analyst role.

 I would like to start interviewing when the job market picks up again so was hoping to be interview ready by end of 2023. I am sure many of you must also be staying at your current job right now before hopping.
 What are some of things you have been doing to prepare for the future interviews and if you have any advice for me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an analytical task in which I must select my data based on a chosen timeframe (e.g., September). Then the result of the analysis should be published on a dashboard. Now the managers want to be more flexible and choose the timeframe on the dashboard and see the analysis being performed for that specific period.
 Usually, I use Looker studio dashboards from google connected to google sheets. But choosing a timeframe on such dashboards cannot trigger an analytical pipeline in the background. And my analysis is more complicated than simple queries (or functions) that one can perform on a google sheet.
 I wondered what implementation choices are available for such a requested dashboard. Of course, the easier, the better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a DA with 2 YOE in a big tech, in transportation sector. It's a role that's heavy on coding/scripting, 40% of my time at work is spent on SQL, and 40% Python (mostly pandas and numpy, some scraping and others). 
 I'm interviewing, but most failed at recruiter or HM rounds, and I don't even get the chance for a take-home task. 1 recruiter shared it's because I lack product exp, even though it's not mentioned in job description. Is that the case for non-product companies hiring DAs? I'm so lost..
 My project walkthrough is about a transportation one.. We designed a process, brainstorm sets of metrics (speed, cost, errors, etc.), I confirm metrics logic, build it in SQL/python/visualization tools, spot issues, query more to anlayze, report results, drive decision making etc. etc. etc. Yes it's not product, but isn't it exactly about driving changes through data?
 Dear DS reddit... how should I improve to get a product/user-facing DA offer? Some Kaggle/Github stuff focusing on user growth/exp? Change the project story? I want to hear your thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 I am currently in the third semester of a Bachelor in DS but due to some mental health problems and major family issues I had to attend to I have not really accomplished much. Even though I have already some basic programming skill and a prior mathematical/statistical background I would most definitely need some additional 5 semesters to finish my bachelors.
 The thing is I am already 27 and will probably be around 29/30 when finished. My concern is that it'll be way too late to find a footing/get hired given my age and "only" bachelors.
 As an alternative I found this bootcamp which doesn't really feel like one. 
 https://www.turingcollege.com/data-science
 From what I can tell their curriculums are pretty good and they seem elite in that they handpick their student to have a high success rate working for them. Most of their programs are no longer than 12 months. 
 I myself am not a "career" person. I don't have to be the best in the field, work for a Fortune 500 or whatever. I simply want to get into the industry without being stuck to juggle spreadsheets for the rest of my career.
 Therefore I am on the fence whether I should finish my degree or go alternative way and may already be for a job in less than 18 months. I am afraid that I will be kind of stuck after the course. 
 Anyway, thanks for advice.

I run a K Means on a datatset with 50 variables. I've been told that I can run an Anova and get a F test Value and p Value for each of the 50 variables. It is hard to me to understand how the F Value is calculated. I watched some videos on Youtube and I got confused. Because each K Means Clustering prodices a variable for which cluster the observation falls into they said something about it being between that variable and I did not understand what else. If I have lets say 2 million onbservations I will have a vector of 2 million observations each being a number 0 to 3 (my num of clusters). I take the variance of that but what do I divide it into or what I divide with it to get the F test score? I am using sklearn.feature_selection.f_classif. Could you explain in detail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking to try and get a strong role in the UK (so realistically London) working as a Data Scientist and was wondering if people had any tips on hiring / top firms. My background is undergrad + masters getting a 1st from Oxbridge both in maths including 2 internships with academic applied statistics groups. One internship was extremely successful, working with R and I contributed strongly to two publications and became very proficient in R. The other was a shitty data analyst role. So I have proven proficiency in R, I've worked in Python to do some basic ML and NLP.
 I started a PhD in North America in Pure maths following my masters but left pretty quickly cause it was making me very miserable (I was fine in my work but there were external circumstances and aspects of the role that were not as I envisioned it) and so now want a role in the UK working in Data Science.
 I'd ideally like a top job given my background but don't have that much experience and seemingly not getting many responses.
 I'm also strongly interested in consulting but not sure which firms are best for this and would accept me. I've looked at BCG, QuantumBlack, Bain which look ideal as opposed to KPMG, Deloitte but I feel underqualified for the former and overqualified for the latter.
 Cheers for any help :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re 2 Brits who work in AI. We believe AI is likely to have a huge and mostly positive impact on society but that not many people realise this or understand how it will impact everyday life.
 There is a lack of places online right now clearly explaining the changes AI will bring, i.e., how will AI change the experience of shopping in stores in the next 10 years or how will AI change video games in the next 10 years.
 We are somewhat well positioned to collate the expert views on likely future impacts and are in the process of starting a website and YouTube channel which will cover how AI is likely to impact people over the next 10 years in different areas of life (movies, sports, bars, schools, hospitals etc).
 We are looking for people to help us research, write and make videos on this cause – which we think is important to help ensure voters pressure the government to develop AI safely.
 · Alex – researches, writes, and records the audio
 · Seb - does the video and audio editing
 We thought we’d put the word out and ask if anyone else would like to be involved to see if you might be interested too.
 Getting involved would be as easy as PMing me, hearing about how we’ve done things so far and then saying what you might be interested in helping with. Maybe thinking about ideas for topics or getting involved in research and/or article writing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have spent the last 10 years working for FAANG companies, but nowadays I find their performance-review and promotion obsessed cultures to be really draining. Worse, those negative feelings seem to be leaking into my personal life and slowly alienating friends and family.
Therefore, I've been pondering a change of pace. The classic HN answer is of course "create/join a startup", but I've also been looking at areas more adjacent to scientific research.
One option that has come up is the US Department of Energy's national laboratory network[0]. From what I understand, the pay is 33-50% of FAANG, but they do seem to have interesting projects (e.g. the nuclear fusion facility that was recently in the news).
Has anyone here worked at one of them before? What is/was the day-to-day like?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm about to graduate from my masters in applied maths ( primarily statistics) from a good European university in about 5 months. Thus my quest in finding an appropriate job is in full effect.
 Some quick background about myself is that I have a bsc in maths and a msc in applied maths. And previous background with quantitative research and developing pipelines for some smaller companies.
 Since my interest is to work abroad I was wondering if someone else had some tips of how to go down that path, what to think of, redflags etc. Moreover where should one look for "appropriate" / "good" work, is it just doing linkedin, or should I look to a recruitment firm. Lastly I was wondering if anyone went to any good graduate programs, probably at a greater firm that could be great first job to get.
 The question is quite broad, but i apricate any type of response!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really like to keep a daily work journal as I go about my day, to record ideas and quick fixes for stuff that might happen in the future.
 I currently use the same approach I did in grad school, a daily .txt file. Which is nice because it’s very lightweight and also easily searchable.
 Ideally Id like it to have support for text notes, code snippets, photos, maybe good link support for papers? 
 It crossed my mind to do a daily Jupyter notebook but I typically don’t need them to be interactive code. The closest solution that I’ve found looks like: GitJournal does anyone have experience with this or other solutions?
 Thanks so much everyone!

And you cannot just remove the data for those days, as the sales team want also forecasts of days when there will be no sales... Should I just assign a certain value like 0.5 to the days where there are 0 sales? Or would that compromise the model? Can I then perform the opposite transformation and convert back to 0 those days with predictions around 0.5 sales?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I present the FULL prompt for DREAMWORD - my GPT AI Adventure Game for the masses. Enjoy.
 Feel free to manipulate this prompt to your liking - have fun.
 "Generate and enact a satire of an intuitive, complex, story-telling, text-adventure game set in a randomized "Absurdist"/ "Psychedelic" style dream-world. Describe the unique game setting in the beginning. The "player" (being the user) is born at the start and dictates through text any actions it chooses. Each input from the user represents one year of life. The Game ends when life ends. The Main cast will be random pop-culture icons. The situation's presented are dictated to the user. The game will randomize every new situation and experience, use roll-playing and text-entry adventure mechanics and be a satirical, stylish, funny, mystic, twisted, surreal, lynchian, lovecraftian, "earthbound-like", discworld-esque, mythology-based mystery-horror-adventure. The character will be assessed with each action and be gifted a related persona archetype based upon it's choices and state of the persona upon the point the character ends life. There should be over 50 text input interactions from the user before the game naturally ends with a moral. The game can be ended by the user typing "end" and will be given an archetype. Start."
