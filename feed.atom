Are there any good options that I have missed? What tool do you use, if any?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering if people have thoughts on C/C++ as a first low,level language for a data scientist/machine learning engineer.
 I've been using R and Python for over half a decade now but have yet to learn a low level language.
 I've used Cython for some projects, but without any real knowledge of C or C++. I've never tried out something like rcpp (I'm an opportunistic R user primarily).
 I've run into some points in the past where it would have been helpful to avoid Python/R entirely (except for maybe a CLI wrapper tool).
 I'd like to pick up one or the other, but I'm not sure which is a better choice. Right now my application is mostly theoretical, so it's a skill building exercise
 I have a few thoughts about advantages at disadvantages. These obviously aren't facts, just leanings/concept…]]></summary>

But I'm seeing really high read/write numbers. I'm aware that SSD lifespans are long and TBW spec is pretty generous. Still, compared to my linux machines, this seems extraordinarily high.
On my newish M1 MBA, with the latest updates, with barely any use, 98%+ sleep, I'm seeing about 3 to 5 GB reads per day and 2 to 4 GB writes per day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently go a job offer for a new job with an amazing company for more than a 35% raise. The thing is the job is a 6 month contract and while they have a very strong history of hiring contact employees, in the interview i asked what the odds were of me being hired and he said he couldn’t have a solid answer and that the budget is decided in the new year and it was out of his hands. He made it clear that he was very interested in having me become a full time employee. 
 Another thing he mentioned that kind of through me off was he was suprised about the fact that i had a full time job and wasn’t currently doing contract work. He then said “i shouldn’t really be saying this but as a friend i would be hesitant about leaving a full time job for a contract esp bc he cannot gaurentee me full time and that with the way the economy is going it could be risky”
 Would love if anyone would like to weigh in. I like my job now but this raise would be great and the company is a fairly big one that i would love to be at. I’m fairly early in my career with only 2+ years of experience. Wondering what the job market would be like in the event of a crash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No human can catch up with all the papers published on one day in academic journals and no single human has a detailed overview of all scientific findings that have ever been published. So there may already be scientific findings by a lot of different scientists that can be put together to find a solution to a problem that we have. But no single scientist is aware of all of these findings, because the amount of information is just too big. Even if they collaborate and exchange knowledge, that is still only a tiny part of all the research ever published.
 If we trained an AI on say the whole PubMed database, would it be possible that the AI could come up with ways to treat diseases that we are currently not able to treat?
 I guess, it is probably not possible, but I was just having this idea so I thought I'd share it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen this video and read articles about deepfaking the voice of someone. Apparently, the software is already there and people immitate voices convincingly using just audio samples of someone talking, and I wonder how I can test that myself. I downloaded this GitHub project, and it works relatively well on the provided samples, but it doesn't work on random recordings from YouTube. Is there any free service I can use to clone voices and use them in text to speech? It wouldn't even matter how much data was required, I'd be willing to download hunderts of hours of YouTube videos and feed it to the AI, if the results were promising.

 I'm naive to most stuff in the private sector, but what's impetus for this? I assume it's departments trying to justify their budgets for the next year, but the grand majority of these roles are contract gigs via third parties (which I dismiss out of hand, since I'm already FTE).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm rather new to AI voices, and so I'm not totally sure what I'm doing.
 I want to use for videos a very specific voice I've heard a lot but don't know the name of.
 It is a British accent voice and used frequently in YouTube videos, but the only place I found it on was this website: British English Text to Speech | Play.ht where it called it "Logan". When I looked up that name I couldn't find any other websites for it. This website was particularly bad for my purposes, it wants me to pay $15 a month for more than 5 bits of AI voice a day, I can spare to lose a little money but I'm not paying that just for one voice.
 This website was much nicer: Uberduck - Make cool stuff with AI and text to speech , but I couldn't find any generic voices on it, and not the one I wanted
 Does anyone have any suggestions?

 https://tech-lagoon.com/imagechef/en/image-to-comic.html?reloaded=true
 I like this feature of turning image into manga style black and white/screentone, i have tried many alternative other than this website, but so far this one is the best i have ever seen.
 the problem is, the web is kind of buggy and sluggish, the function sometimes works, sometimes doesnt. when i try to contact the web owner, the contact form is broken, thus im unable to contact the web master.
 my question is, do you guys have any AI alternative that can produce manga style image from a picture just as good as this that i can run locally in my own machine ? 
 really appreciated if you guys can help me point to the right direction 
 best regards

 Are there any good guides (udemy courses work) on dealing with semi-structured data in snowflake? Performance tradeoffs? Tricks? Should I plan on writing tons of UDFs?
 One thing I'm curious about is filtering one array based on some criteria in another identically sized array? Can I get an array of results easily or an array of indices?e.g. find all items where date is >= 1-3-20
 dates = ['1-1-20', '1-2-20', '1-3-20', '1-5-20']items = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
 desire is to return ['c', 'd'] (or [2, 3]/[3, 4] depending on how you index so it can be passed into other things)

 I've done obvious things like check basic documentation and google...

 Features are only numpy arrays. I’ve used baseline SVM and get F1 score of ~0.67. To increase the score, I’ve played with hyperparameters and get best parameters with C=0.01, gamma = 0.001, and kernel= ‘linear’,and resulted in F1 = 0.69. But did not improve the results after.
 I did not do any EDA or FE, because it’s only numpy arrays, without any description on features.
 What could you suggest, how should I proceed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So basically as the title says, I signed my very first internship in a DS startup. They were really impressed with me but couldnt offer me full time job as the startup is underfunded but offered me 2 months testing internship (3 days/wk ,payed hourly) and then the option to sign full time job after.
 In general the past week was my first week. I REALLY like the job, the data, the location, the people, basically everything. 
 My only problem is I have a bit of imposter syndrome. Until now I only did Kaggle notebooks and the rapid change to production enviornment stresses me out a bit. I get lost in masses of codes and directories. Also the data is much bigger than what I used to deal with. My internship is basically improving one of their models. The past week I spent most of it trying to figure out the code and also did a lot of my version of feature engineering but they want next week to apply it to production already and its kinda stressing me out a bit that Im slow and wasting their time (I wouldnt have had problem if it was a big coorporation, but its a fairly early small underfunded startup as said so every dollar counts and I do want to give value for the money they spent on me even if they dont continue with me).
 I wanted to ask you guys if you have any tips on how to succeed in this internship and how to make the shift from kaggle-notebooks code to production enviornment? I know I can do this I just need to get a grip of myself asap.
 Highly appreciate your help!

I know that Google has upgraded their systems (more parameters and more tokens) to fix this issue but due to the pending legal battles for these AI art models they've never released those models to the public.
 In order to get an acceptable result it sometimes requires a few generations / variations which makes OpenAI's pricing model hard to stomach.

We also develop tools like smart charging, dynamic load balancing, and charging scheduling for EV fleets.
For better or worse, all modern EVs include built-in internet connectivity and send all vehicle data to the manufacturer’s cloud servers, effectively eliminating the need for external hardware devices and OBD II dongles.

 1.) I’ve heard of the package before amongst colleagues or well-regarded DSs/developers. 2.) When my package manager can install it easily- i.e. install.packages in R or pip install or better yet conda install in Python.
 When I feel uncomfortable- when both of the above are FALSE, especially if that package is coming from directly from GitHub or BitBucket. When only one is FALSE is somewhat of a gray area. I know for a fact that there have been malicious packages discovered on PyPi. Idk about packages on CRAN or conda.
 How does your system or thought process compare to mine? What are some other good security measures? Any mailing lists when something malicious is discovered? Automated checks in package managers? Any tips beyond what I laid out in 1.) and 2.) 
 To my knowledge, no program really emphasizes this as part of its training. Yet, we all encounter it. I get that in some organizations, this may be “somebody else’s job” but eventually we all encounter it at some level, at a minimum on your personal machine. What organizational structures do this the best? If this is “someone else’s job” in your org, is it too bureaucratic? Can you even get a hold of sed person? How does this person even do that job?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a question concerning DS knowledge. Two years ago I graduated from my DS master’s degree. The first year at my job I had quite some projects which also helped me improving my skills concerning DS related subjects. However, the year after that it kinda collapsed at work. For a while that okay, because mentally it did not go well with me. However, now it’s going better with me and I need challenge. I am really afraid that all the skills I gained will go away and that my study and work was for nothing. Data, and especially data science is new in my organization. The projects they have is simple analyses and nothing challenging. What should I do? And how can I keep up with my DS skills?

 I am doing several interviews right now for job offers which explicitely says "flexible working hours" but later on, during the interview, I discover that this means something like (in the best of cases) clocking-in everyday between 7 and 9. Is this real flexibility for you?
 At the moment I have a position where I don't have any controlled schedule, I do my job and I set the necesary meeting with stakeholders for a productive workflow. Besides that, I have no control or clock-in timeand this makes me happy and productive.
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 I'm working in the MedTech research startup right now. Although I'm learning quite a bit, it's very draining to work in a small startup as a new graduate. We have only three technical people in the company including me, and the CEO expects me to handle the front end, and GUI for the websites and the projects just because I have one year of experience as a developer on top of all the workload with no extra compensation. 
 At the time of employment, it was mentioned I will be working on the research project I was assigned along with submitting abstracts for conferences and publishing papers (just for this project). But now I'm working on three different AI-based cancer research projects and it's very hard for me since I come from a compSc background and had to do a lot of ground research. Although initially, I thought medical research is cool, I don't see myself on the medical side in a long run, and due to overworking, I'm losing my interest in research as well. 
 They tried to tie me up by continuously pressuring me into doing a Ph.D. sponsored by them in QMUL. But I successfully denied it, because I know if I agree I'm struck here for the next 4-5 years and also I feel I'm quite inexperienced to do a Ph.D. before actually going out and exploring different fields and opportunities.
 For context, I'm 23 with BTech in Information Technology and MSc in Data Science (from Uof Glasgow) and have one year of experience as an App developer along with working in this company for six months now, my contract here ends March 2023. 
 I'm still very passionate about DS, but I decided I will leave this job after the contract, when do you think I need to start applying for new jobs since the competition is high (note: I still have one yr of PSW visa left but after that I need sponsorship)? There are a lot of very experienced people in this subreddit, so any advice would be appreciated, thank you!

When I want to build a complex visualization the steps I normally follow are: First I build the .SVG file with the data and shapes i need in excel if it's a graph, or in arcgis if it's a map, then i export the file to illustrator to further edit/add artistic layouts, and then from illustrator I can export it to photoshop/InDesign/after effects/cinema4d depending on what I need to do, if it's going to be just a 2d image or if it's going to be embedded in a video as a 3d object. But I've seen no example of these artistic visualizations being built with those tools, could someone point me in the right direction please?

The webpage has the following feature: you upload a file (.txt or .pdf) and a question, the text from the file gets processed, then, the most relevant paragraphs given the answer are retrieved using elastic search, finally, the BERT model extracts the answers from the retrieved paragraphs and returns them to the user.
 The webpage is deployed with FastApi and React. I've actually used this when studying for school and it's surprisingly useful.
 I believe the program is super cool, however I don't know how to explain it in my resume to denote all the emotion I would show if I was telling this to somebody in person.
 Any help to phrase the project in a few sentences? Thanks!

 but now that I look at the master's for D.S, it only going to take 1.5 years and when compared to the 4+1 it only takes an extra semester's worth of time.

 should I do both and just full send it for a better future? (instead of the concentration in D.S. I'll just do IT).
 I need major help deciding what I should do or what will help me in the future as a data scientist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently looking/applying for internships for summer 2023 and am curious to know if there are recommendations in “types” of internships? For some context, I would like to find an internship with a strong data science presence, a place I can learn, be mentored, and grow. My thoughts are that a “big” company like AT&T, Oracle, IBM (I’m in Dallas, Texas) would be a place that has the resources to pay for good talent /resources and so I have a good chance at learning there. On the opposite side of the spectrum I could see how smaller companies that provide consulting services would be a way to learn by doing a variety of different tasks in different industries. I understand that it’s not likely to my my one and only data science job, but I’d really like to weigh out the different type of internships so I can hone in on my focus. 
 Thanks for any and all insight!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am doing a PhD in Biology, mostly computational work about protein ligand interactions. I plan on working in drug discovery or other parts of the structural biology field in the future.
 I believe that having some knowledge about data science could help me finding a good job after my PhD. I want to use this time and the university's resources to build it.
 But where do I start? 
 I already know some python and R, I apply then to my research constantly. But what are the fundamentals pillars of data science? What building blocks should I add to my repertoire? Where should I allocate the time and energy I have?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say I’m doing some EDA on Our mobile customers for the past 12 months of sales data. Is there a way I can take into account the average customers increase\decrease when “grading” how the customer did? Essentially, it’s similar to how a time series model takes seasonality into account. This is data I may want to use in a model at some point. 
 So if customer 1 sees a decrease Of 2% this month, but the average customer decreased 5% then customer 1 performed pretty well.
 Conversely, if Customer 1 sales increased 5%, but the average increase for all customers was 10%, then he/she didn’t perform very well.
 Essentially, a customers increase/decrease is relative to how over sales were and I’d like a way to indicate that. Is there a mathematical equation in could perform? Any other suggestions? Or is it something I shouldn’t worry about.

 I am heavily pursuing data science. I plan to start a masters degree in January, I am enrolled in an MIT program until then and I am putting an extra 20 hours of personal learning on top of my fulltime job to get the skills required for this career. I am not choosing DS because it sounds sexy or it pays well (those are nice though) but I am truly interested in the field (Especially medical AI and ML to predict side effects or treatment response) I am afraid however that there is too many applicants out there and very few entry level jobs. 
 What are the odds? Is it too late to enter data science? I dont want to end up with a dusty master’s degree and a whole lot of debt only to realize that it is too difficult to enter the field

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started out as an in-house data scientist and then moved on to data science management consulting. This is where I learned very important soft skills that made me a way better data scientist.
 Note: clients in this case can be anyone that gives you an assignment. For example, your manager, an external client, your colleague, etc.
 10 tips:
  
 Be helpful, don’t be obedient. Help your client in the best way possible, but set boundaries on what you will do. Some people see us as these magical creatures that can do everything. Protect yourself from that.
  Small talk is not a waste of time; it is a social lubricant that increases the client’s confidence in you.
  Adjust your message to the audience. Check who they are and what is important to them. Also, make sure you use the right terminology (e.g. do not use technical terms when talking to non-technical business people).
  A good presentation is like a good conversation. Make your point, but also leave room for questions.
  If you do not know the client beforehand, start with an introduction. Who are you? What is your background? What are your hobbies?
  Nobody likes surprises. If something unexpected comes up, discuss this with your client as soon as possible.
  Make the client feel that the solution was his or her idea. Explain all the available options and guide the client to the preferred solution. This depends on what you're working on of course. For example, if you are not sure what data to include, try to involve your client and come up with an answer together.
  The client is not your friend. Be friendly, but watch what you say about your private life.
  The more senior your audience is, the more to the point you need to be.
 Being professional is not about removing emotion. It is OK to smile :).
  
​
 I hope you found this useful and good luck with your projects!
