I had applied for the position on December 1st, after 2 interviews I got the call this afternoon. My best advice is don’t get hung up on the job title, look at the description. Mine was listed as a programmer but it is working with SQL, Python and Tableau. I wouldn’t have found it based on the title.

 Hey all, need some advice. I'm early into my career, but I'm trying to figure out how to go forward from here. A little bit of background. I have a BS & MS in essentially information/computer science (not quite as theory/math heavy as CS, more application focused, but I digress), with emphasis in machine learning/AI for business problems. Basically, my knowledge might be more in line with advanced analytics (applying existing models to new business domains…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a fourth-year transfer (with an additional year left in school) and have been trying to find internships for anything data related. I have asked before in the data analysis subreddit about my resume but I did not get much feedback. Since I apply to co-op's next semester, I would appreciate any feedback. I don't know what is wrong with my resume (maybe I should not include all these libraries I have worked with and only the significant ones). I also have more projects under my belt (I recently finalized a machine learning project where I implemented a basic binary class. neural network), but I am unsure if that would truly stand out and help. I know my background is more analytics, but I would like more data science-related work. 
 Feedback I have received:
 - Remove the school I tranferred from and only include my current one
 - Change Data Research Student to Research Analyst (was part of a research program at my school that connected us with small companies in the area).
 Any feedback is much appreciated! Thank you!

same patient each year
 each person has 5 predicted risks (for each year) - e.g. in 2017 there risk was 2%, in 2018 the same patients risk was 8% etc
 The equation predicts the risk of an event in 5 years
 n is approx 100
  
I will conduct sensitivity and specificity, but would it make sense to produce a confusion matrix that includes all 5 years' false negatives, true positives etc?
 If I were to use AUCROC analysis, would it be appropriate to make 5 aucroc curves for each year?
 Thank you guys, Id appreciate any help

My job's great in the sense it's full stack, I lead all the research, model design and deployment on my team. BUT lately I've felt the itch that I'm never really dealing with the harder engineering and optimisation problems that come with large-scale data. 
 I'm wondering should I accept my skills for what they are, or is it worth killing myself going back to online courses and move to a lower position in a company that deals with these problems. Basically my FOMO has passed a critical point, and I'm wondering if I should give in to it. Anyone been in a similar position and tried to switch?

 They want a dashboard built from these files that can be refreshed every day.
 Have you ever looked at a client's data and said "nope.. I couldn't be bothered". 
 I think this job is more of a company wide digital transformation programme than just building some dashboards. 
 Unfortunately this decision is not up to me. But just looking for senior viewpoints.

I’m ok at coding and da but I don’t know what I don’t know when it comes to things like… working with a team, office politics, how to handle situations that might come up, what if they ask me to do something I don’t know how to do or if it takes me longer than they expect. What else do I need to know and prepare for or get good at that I’m not expecting? Thanks for the help 🙏
 Edit: just wanted to add that this is a government position in case anyone has specific advice for that realm ty

 How would you guys actually predict the safety outcome of a low-frequency, high-impact disaster event like the Titanic?
 How would you explore the data and select variables? And how would you measure performance? 
 Feel free to use your imagination.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a Product Analyst, and my product manager wants to improve the metric Time to Value (TTV) (how long it takes for a user to start a process and finish it). Our goal is to lower the TTV for our users.
 We are seeing TTV ranges from 2 minutes to 15+ days, and this is not unexpected. It's long tail data, heavily clustered in the 10-20 minutes zone, and then slowly tapering off. 
 The mean or median alone doesn't really tell us anything, because the data is so long tailed.
 What metric can I use that will show if we are improving? I thought the mode and the interquartile range could work. A decrease in the mode would show that we are decreasing the hump of the tail, and a decrease in the IQR would show that the spread is also decreasing. (I chose the mode because it is typically the smallest value in a left tail distribution; all of the numbers are long decimals, so I'll probably need to round them.) 
 Anyone have better ideas? Google tells me a common choice with skewed data is to transform it logarithmically, but I don't know what to do with that transformed data set- just measure the mean?

 I have heard so many times from the top-level employees (C-suite) of the company about the visionary outlook of the next few years to come. I always thought of it as just fluff. But I might be wrong so I wrote an article in the same way as my leadership spoke about the Role of AI in XYZ. I wanted to check with Redditors on their take.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a dilemma at work. We have this simple algorithm that provides good/bad for a given issue. The task we have is to find an algo that can outperform this.
 Now I walk into a discussion and see that people are using the good/bad labels for the current algo as the ground truth to compare many other algos from pyOD. I see a bunch of ROC curves for all of these models. And talk about one model is better than another...
 Now I ask what is the performance of the current running algorithm? And how do we compare to that? I get pushback on how it isn't possible to quantify that and that ground truth is subjective.... However I am saying how can any new model outperform the existing one if the existing one is perfect, they say it isnt perfect but just use it for labeling...
 It is hard to convince them that we need to get manual labels to quantify the current model, then we can see if anything useful can be detected beyond that. I feel like nobody understands the issue and I would like to convince them that their approach doesn't make sense. Or am I missing something? Is it not valid to use one algo as ground truth to compare algos?
 Seems suspicious... There is no example that can show any new algo detecting something new, because old algo is the truth...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey people, I'd like to share with you guys the project that I've been working on. It is an automated tool for data scientists, data science students, and data analysts, and generates visualizations on-flight.
 Our GitHub: https://github.com/Kanaries/Rath
 So what is RATH, anyway? It is an open-sourced Tableau, to summarize it a little bit. You do not need sound programming experience to get on hand with it. Fun fact: You can embed this Tableau-like module into your own apps with ease! Check it out here: https://github.com/Kanaries/graphic-walker
 RATH is more than just Tableau. It is designed as a "copilot" for data scientists. For most of the people working in this field, you probably already have an established workflow that you do not want to disturb. Good. That's also what we thought. What RATH can do is, RATH automatically generates visualizations and recommendations, which could help, or guide you to explore your data and boost your efficiency. It is like a helper sitting next to you, helping you go through your datasets and giving you ideas in real-time, without disturbing your workflow.
 We are also working on many other creative features! One of the features is called: Data Painter, which allows you to explore your database in an interface similar to Microsoft Painter. You can select, edit, clean, and explore your data using the paint tool and eraser tool. We have a video here to demonstrate these features more visually: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djqePNyhz7w
 If you find our project interesting or have any other thoughts or suggestions, don't be hesitated to ask! Cheers :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! Currently, I am reading the papers on Deep Learning based Recommender Systems. After around 20 papers, I realised the base idea of the papers is the same - recommendation task either Top-K recommendations or simply predicting the utility (i am not talking about those frameworks that simply model the auxiliary information). The papers has differences in base models (I am reading DNN/MLP, Autoencoder and Attentive models based), but the task is the same - replace the way to factorize the matrix to find the latent feature vectors of users/items/social relations, only some papers introduce custom loss function with regularisation terms (just to model the social network I would say). And all there models perform as "state-of-the-art". The question is where is this research field going/developing? All these findings/performance results are simply empirical with no theoretical evidence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Dear reditors, Some posts exist about this topic, but are at minimum 2years old, and our job evolves fast... 
 I approach 3 years of experience, and in the market I am in (France) it might be a time where you'll be promoted from junior to senior. From what I've seen in the market so far, the title are "data scientist", "senior datascientist", "lead datascientist", with respectively 0y of experience, 3-5y of experience, 5-8 y
 Anyway, according to you, what distinguishes a junior from a senior (or vice versa?)
 Second question : is it common that decisions are taken solely based on a junior, or is it more a thing for senior/lead? I am basically the only DS in my company. For modeling, A/B testing, statistical analysis, I do everything from interviewing the "clients", I design the solution, model it, help our DE putting it in production,present it back to C levels. The only lead DS I've encountered in the company is a consultant and works alone on a specific project (and only that one) . I've had 2hours maximum with him in 8months. 
 Thank you in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can We Predict When an Employee Is About to Quit?
 Resignations represent one of the most emotional, stressful, and challenging situations leaders face. They undermine confidence in ourselves, our leadership, and our organizations. They threaten the status quo. And they have the potential to compromise team dynamics and business results.
 The biggest problem with resignations is that they are supposedly unpredictable. There is no way any manager can predict with some degree of accuracy when an employee will quit.
 Now things will change with AI.
 IBM has created a new AI system that can predict with 95% accuracy which workers are about to quit their jobs. It is called the "predictive attrition program," which was developed with IBM Watson software to predict employee flight risk and prescribe actions for managers to engage employees.
 As IBM CEO Gini Rometty said,
  
“It took time to convince company management it was accurate and, so far, it has saved IBM nearly $300 million in retention costs.”
  
Further, Rometty claimed that the AI system could zero in on an individual's strengths. In turn, this can enable a manager to direct an employee to future opportunities they may not have seen using traditional methods. This will also help employees develop future skills and prevent getting redundant.
 All this is wonderful. But a pertinent question remains unanswered.
 Why do we need to run a sophisticated prediction analysis program on our employees to gauge which ones will leave? We are all humans, after all. Do we need a machine to find out if we are unhappy?
 The short answer is No. While AI will give the numbers and dates, it cannot be a one-stop solution to address the inherent problem of an employee quitting the organization. In fact, it can aggravate the problem if used indiscriminately.
