        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have many millions of rows of user data that I need to reshape from long format to wide format in order to cluster these users based on their attribute values. Since it's a high-dimensional data set, I'd like to 
  
Reshape the data frame to conform to the second image (wide format)
 Reduce the dimensions 
 Cluster things up (k-means).
  
Unsurprisingly, however, I run out of memory on my local machine when doing this in pandas (pd.pivot() doesn't work particularly well, as you can imagine).
 Have folks who have worked with high-dimensional data found a way to do this other than setting up some real expensive cloud servers? Is there any way to do so piecemeal? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am looking for feedback on an idea I'm working on.
 It's a desktop application that will allow you to open the most common data file formats (CSV, JSON, Excel, Avro, Parquet etc.) and explore their contents in a nice table, you'll be able to search, filter, sort, group rows or run custom SQL.
 From the table view you can also create charts and export them as images, or export a subset of the data as another data format, so you can effectively convert between data formats too.
 In the future I might add some data cleansing features but for now it's just viewing / analyzing.
 The idea is for this app to be kind of a data swiss knife, something you reach out when you have to quickly view a file and don't want to write a script or import the data in a database.
 It's still early days and got a couple of people that are interested, but I'd like to validate the idea further by verifying that I am actually solving a problem, especially for people that work with data.
 I have a couple of questions:
 Would you find something like this useful in your day to day? Would you pay for it? If not you personally, would your business pay for this so your team can use it?
 I would really appreciate any feedback, thanks a lot!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 Looking to start a project to build an in-house text to SQL (which I then use to query a relational DB) tool for some of the engineers (not software...no experience with SQL). Have any of you folks done something of the sort before and would be able to recommend a decent starting point? For the starter version it'd be very simple.. most likely one dataset and simple questions (i.e. no joins, only SELECT FROM WHERE). 
 I have heard of OpenAI's GPT-3, but am not looking to ask my org to pay for any third party systems at the moment (still very much an exploratory project). Additionally, I'm looking to further my experience and expertise in DS/AI, so this might be a good way to do just that (as far as NL processing goes).
 Thank you!

Are there any free resources that I can use that will help to accurately tell me if data science would be right for me or if I like it. I wouldn’t just want to throw myself at a career just bc it’s lucrative but I’m really interested in being able to retrieve data and analyze. If anyone can DM me or send any links to anything, I would greatly appreciate it. I have about 3 weeks off from work and I’d like to use this time to learn about different fields.

I have some funding to build a machine and am planning to also use it for training some deep learning models. So I'm currently considering an Intel i9 13900k, 128GB RAM, and an RTX 4090 GPU. But would I benefit from a Threadripper pro CPU for GAs? It wouldn't do much for deep learning but if it would benefit GA work then I could justify it. Thanks! 
 Note: Apparently I'm restricted from posting at /r/genetic_algorithms as it's only for "trusted members". I hope it's ok here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN, cofounder of Readwise here. We've been working on this cross-platform reader app for about 2 years, excited to finally share it in public beta.
Probably the most notable thing that makes Reader unique is that it supports almost any content type you could want to save/read/highlight:
* web pages
* emails/newsletters
* PDFs
* ePubs
* twitter threads
* youtube videos (with transcripts)
* RSS feeds
With all of your knowledge content in one place, we built powerful reading and highlighting, as well as a bunch of novel triage/organization features, so you can actually consume & stay on top of that content!
There are also a lot of advanced features too, such as text-to-speech, GPT3 questions/summaries, super powerful highlighting (that includes markup and images), complex filtering/search (with our own query language), sleek mobile triage UI, keyboard shortcuts for reading/everything, integrations with note-taking apps, a browser extension for both saving pages and highlighting them, and much more.
If anyone's interested in more product details, as well as our business model, etc, we wrote a detailed launch post: https://blog.readwise.io/the-next-chapter-of-reader-public-b...
Predicting a common question: Reader is part of the Readwise subscription pricing right now in beta -- there's a 30 day free trial and then it's paid at ~$8usd/month. We also promise to not raise this price for existing subscribers.
Reader is also fairly technically interesting -- our iOS, Android and webapp all work fully offline and sync your reading data/progress with eachother. Our search on web is built with wasm sqlite. We have a fairly intense pipeline for cleaning web articles (removing ads/styling). We share lot of modules around syncing/highlighting across all platforms, etc...
Happy to answer any questions :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[laptop for Data Science and Scientific Computing: proart vs legion 7i vs thinkpad p16/p1-gen5
 I'm looking at four laptop for DS. Not really interested in gaming, just the gpu, good cpu and massive ram. So that kind of brings me to the gaming laptop segment. 
 Main uses:
  
Data preprocessing, Prototyping cuda, rapids ai for accelerating classical data science and machine learning, DL inferencing, building conda enabled containers, 3D modeling/rendering and simulations using python, NLP, openCV, pytorch
  
 Thinkpad p16: 4200$/3900$ (64 vs 32 gb ram)
  
64gb/32gb ddr5, i9 12900hx, rtx a4500 16gb vram, 1 TB, 3480 vs 2400, 230W power adapter 
  
Thinkpad p1 gen5: 3900$
  
32gb ddr5, i9 12900h vpro, rtx 3080ti 16gb vram, 1 TB, 2560 vs 1600, 230W power adapter
  
Asus Proart studiobook: 2999$
  
32gb ddr5, i7 12700h, rtx 3080ti 16gb vram, 2 TB, 3840 vs 2400 4K OLED, 330W power adaptor 
  
Legion 7i: 3500$
  
32gb ddr5, i9 12900hx, rtx 3080ti 16gb vram, 2 TB, 2560 vs 1600 165hz, 300W power adaptor
 I love how beautiful and robust legion 7i is but based on the price difference I'm also leaning towards asus proart in case i7 12th gen isn't too bad to work with.

 I have a job interview for a Data Scientist position (junior) and I have been asked to do a brief (like 10-15min) data science project presentation. The topic is free for me to choose.
 What would you say are the most important things that I should address in the presentation like that?
 I know this is a very broad question, so I don't expect necessarily a very concrete answer, I'm happy to recieve any advice you can give me :)
 Thanks!

And, then there is no refund after 2 days of enrollment. If anyone thinking of udacity, be cautious, thats my advise

I am currently working on a project where the manager expects us to work all day long. He himself works till 2-3AM. And I don't want to know why and how, but this will always be a mystery 
 He keeps saying this is critical and has a tight deadline. I wish I could just say f### this criticality and tight deadlines. I can't be working 12-14 hours everyday and exhaust myself. I literally see blurr and severe headaches after the 10-11th hour.
 This has been going on for 3 weeks continuously now and every time he keeps saying how we need to pace up and match his level of speed and commitment and he literally asks us to be "robots" and keep working.
 I did hear of past employees changing teams because of his way of working.
 PS : there is a time difference of 6 hours and he literally keeps on messaging us on MS Teams for updates, asks us for calls and updates at midnight!!!

 But now when I am reading the neural network part of the book with Keras and TensorFlow, I slowly realised that these tools are used for a really big datasets and features for tasks such as computer vision, voice recognition, etc and not for business analysis applications. Am I right in this feeling that the basic ML tools are enough, or is there real application for neural networks and advanced ML tools for business data analysis?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers in Israel have come up with an artificial intelligence tool capable of analysing ECG tests and predicting heart failure with an unprecedented accuracy rate.
 According to the Times of Israel, the technology is currently being used for patients who suffer from myositis — a condition that significantly increases the risk of heart failure.
 The AI model was updated by feeding the data from ECG scans and medical records of 89 patients suffering from myositis between 2000 and 2020. The report claimed that the AI can understand subtle patterns in the ECGs and predict possible heart failures well ahead of time.
 Head Researcher, Dr. Shahar Shelly of Rambam Healthcare Campus said:
 “We are running ECG tests through the AI model, which sees details that doctors can’t normally detect and then predicts who is at risk of heart failure,” said Shelly.
 “Given that it’s these cardiac dysfunctions that often end up killing people, this can save lives.”
 Another Game-changing development from AI, and this one is absolutely MASSIVE

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, so far I've done small stuff, exploring data sets from Kaggle and data I've generated myself (e.g. analysing letter frequency of some documents I'd written) and applying different ML algorithms and statistical tests and visualization techniques using library functions in R and Python. 
 I'm an EE major but I added on a data science minor last year because of how much I like statistics (and because I wanted an excuse to take courses involving any sort of programming) and I found that I really enjoy the statical coding we used in my DS courses to analyze and visualize data. I finished all the courses required for the minor, so I want to continue doing learning more of it on my own, just doing personal projects. 
 My question is whether, just being a hobbyist (and so not having access to any huge databases like companies might use to store customer data or the like), is there any point to trying to teach myself SQL? Like, if I'm just using data from Kaggle and the like, which can easily by downloaded as an Excel file and imported into a Jupyter notebook (using either R or Python) is there anything relevant that'd be easier to do in SQL? Or is SQL only relevant when dealing with actual databases?

Over the years I have become better, because I actively push myself to lead meetings or be in uncomfortable speaking opportunity scenarios to push myself. But unfortunately it's still not second nature to me
 There is an HUGE amount of prep work I need to do before each meeting to be decently articulate. 
 Either in interviews or internal promotions I think my communication skills really hold me back. I understand I'll never be smooth like a salesperson maybe but curious if you have tips to improve communication skills to grow in your career
