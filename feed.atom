        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I worked with data and I noticed that many times packages like pandas profiling really help answer most of my questions when starting a project. I heard from one of my peers during my studies that it is better to manually explore the data but I feel that this is pointless when effort and energy can be better focused on diving deeper than doing basic histograms/pie charts that would be finished with 3-4 lines of code. I would appreciate insight and would love if more tools are recommended because so far I noticed that tools really help more in my own opinion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently exploring the ML space and I am wondering what tools should be focused on in a practical sense of landing a role? 
 I had done some research and found that TensorFlow has better visualization and is currently the industry standard. There is also a certification that can be obtained for TensorFlow. On the other hand, PyTorch has the ease of use and ability to debug issues faster. Performance is also faster. It is currently gaining steam and there is talk of overtaking TensorFlow. 
 Any perspective on these two tools and some guidance would be much appreciated.

 I did some small projects I did for my undergrad but they are really not worthy to put on my portfolio (1 project was for a exploratory data analysis for some geographical data, we were trying to take census data and determine where to open up a cannabis dispensary which sucked, and the other project was comparing different classifiers using the CiFAR10 dataset)
 I do know pandas and seaborn matplotlib and some ML packages like Tensor flow and pytorch.
 Are there some things that are seen as necessary to have on a GitHub portfolio as a new hire trying to get into DS?

In short its an IDE (VSCode/JetBrains) plugin that lets you share blocks of code that link directly to the code inside your IDE or repo. We use it all the time and think its pretty nifty tech that lets you understand someone’s code in context very quickly.  we’re hoping to keep refining it to make it better and more useful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a team as described in the title, what are the type of roles this team would benefit from?
 I'm currently employed as a Data Analyst, but the company has decided to make the stakeholders responsible themselves of the DA tasks. Therefore I am required to take on a new role, which I can either form myself or copy other known roles, such as Data Engineer, which I'm not interested in, at all. I've been doing it (Data Engineering) for about half a year, and it simply doesn't suit me.
 So, I've been instructed by my manager to come up with a list of possible responsibilities another role in our team could have. And frankly, I'm quite clueless. All I know of are Data Engineers, Data Scientists, Data Analysts, Product Owners and scrum masters. And to be honest, I'm nowhere near a Data Scientist (this is my first position as a professional in Data Science - previous experience is Electrical Engineering), and the other roles are not technical enough.
 Do you know of any other role that resembles Data Analysts, which could provide value to a global Data Team?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on a Spotlight-esque UX for calling GPT3 on a Mac recently. You can trigger it globally by hitting Ctrl+Space. And then, just ask GPT3 to solve your problem.
 The app features full, deep integration with your Mac: it can copy your active selection from any window/app and it allows you to insert the results right back into your app.
 You'll never lose your train of thought or place.
 Here are some other use cases: 
  
Generate title and keywords for your blogposts that you're writing on Medium or Substack 
 Getting over writer's block when writing your school paper or a novel in Microsoft Word. 
 Ever forget a UNIX command in Terminal? No problem. Just ask the AI and paste it directly and keep going. 
 Stuck on a coding problem or don't remember how to use an API? Use it in XCode or VSCode or any code editor. 
 Writing an email on Gmail and want to correct the grammar? Easy.
  
Check this little video demo I've put together to see it in action:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I work for an airline company, where we install kiosks at the airports to help customers check-in.
 The process involves scanning your passport to find your booking, but some passengers don't place their passports correctly on the kiosk scanner, which gives an error. To reduce this, my team is thinking of installing a video message into kiosk to show how customers can scan their passports correctly.
 One thing to note is that apart from this error, there can be several other errors that can occur at different stages of the process, but my team is just focusing on the mentioned error.
 Me, as an analyst want, to do AB testing to determine if the video messages actually help reduce the errors or not. To measure this, I have thought of 2 metrics--
  
Count of main error between control and treatment kiosks
 Count of main error/successful transactions
 Count of main error/ all errors
  
Is there anything that I should take care of before using z-test, or test of proportions when doing hypothesis testing, after considering distribution, sample size, variance, etc.
 Any inputs will be much appreciated.

This blog post shows how a new AI-powered data synthesizer tool, Djinn, can upsample synthetic data even better than SMOTE and SMOTE-NC. Using neural network generative models, it has a powerful ability to learn and mimic real data super quickly and integrates seamlessly with Jupyter Notebook.
 Full disclosure: I recently joined Tonic.ai as their first Data Science Evangelist, but I also can say that I genuinely think this product is amazing and a game-changer for data scientists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tl;Dr: How can I learn ml,dl and big data technologies like Hadoop, spark etc without following tutorials?
 I have basics in numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborne and sklearn.
 I have also built some basic ml models 
 I worked on one deep learning model which is a Seq2Seq model for a chatbot. I used pytorch for this.
 The thing is I feel like I don't know much and everything I did was using tutorials.
 How can I learn machine learning, deep learning and the technologies used in big data on my own without much assistance from tutorials?
 I want to be confident with my skills and doing tutorials is easy but not giving me confidence. 
 Whereas I am not able to pick advanced projects and do them on my own.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, so I work for a company which generates a lot of alerts on some known time series data/metrics they monitor. The alerts come from multiple sources and are of different type.
 Now obviously some of that are related and I have created mechanisms (statistical ones) which can group them up based on certain logical methods. This was done to reduce the manual overhead of looking at all alerts individually. We also added the feature to club some alerts into a group and give them a name based on the type of event it is manually (so that they can be used as labels if we want to automate this in the future using ML/DL)
 Well now I have been asked to come up with a ML methodology to do exactly that, where if we recieve a certain set of alerts which are similar in nature to some previously classified group then they be automatically grouped. I have come up with some ideas on how to approach this problem but all of them have some overhead issues. 
 Has anyone ever worked on something similar? I see that there are products out there which kind of do this but how should one go about in approaching such a problem? Any help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I am currently writing my master thesis. The topic revolves around Machine Learning models and electricity grids. I would like to include a chapter in my thesis explaining the various models I am working with. I am looking for resources to take inspiration from in explaining and also, if it includes, the many equations and images that I can use. (Of course I would cite everything).
 Specifically the models I want to touch one are:
  
Random Forest Regression
 Support Vector Regression
 Decision Tree Regression
 Gradient Bossing Regression
 Multi-layer Perceptron
  
Any introductory papers, blogs or GitHub repositories would be very helpful. I tried blogs like "Towards Data Science" and "Medium" but I end up finding myself just clawing through the clutter most of the time, time I don't have (grad school. am I right?)
 Thanks! and Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone
 I've got a question about feature importance. You can have this number fairly easily from the RandomForestClassifier method, but eventually some of those feature are 'more imoprtant' or 'more significant' for one label than the other. The 'more significant' could be in the sense of having bigger values of these feature in one label and less in the other, but I think with Random Forest is not that straightforward, as it could be for some linear model.
 My question is: Is there a way to classify features in the sense of being more significant to labels?

I would really like to give a model a big chunk of text, the size of a book or at least a chapter, and be able to get intelligence answers with natural language like you can with GPT3.
 The issue there is that there's a low limit to the text it can swallow and interpret, at least that's what I run into. Where can I find something like this?

Basically, I stay in a country with terrible pay when compared to global standards. After my master’s program, myself and some colleagues started an analytics consulting business. We’ve mostly focused on companies in my home country (it’s been tough and not forthcoming) and we were looking at expanding the scope to other countries. Do you guys have any advice on how to go about this and what resources (websites, links etcetera) to look at? Basically, we need direction. 
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, 
 I'm currently Big 4 auditor with 2+ years of experience wanting to switch to data analyst/scientist role. 
 I am studying Harvard's CS50 course (I'm on halfway), then I want to study Google's Data analyst certificate, and build up my portfolio. Question is should I continue CS50? I really enjoy it but I looking at problem sets I realized that data analysis is much more related to me due to audit work, than pure coding / software engineering.
 Any advice is appreciated, cheers!

 I was skeptical about these types of tests to begin with so I was doing a little digging on who runs this website. Something about the faces on this website's "About Us" page eerily reminds me of thispersondoesnotexist.com but I can't put my finger on it.
 I also can't find a lot of verifiable info when I google these people's names. So I can't shake the feeling that none of these people are real lol.
 Is there any way to tell if these faces are faces are real or fake?
