        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I’m the cofounder of a tech startup focused on providing free AI services. 
 We’ve developed a pretty cool app that offers AI services like art generation, code generation, image captioning, a chatbot like feature called AAIA, and more for free. 
 We’re sort of like the Swiss Army knife of generative and analytical AI.
 Check us out, and leave us some suggestions, we have a big UI redesign coming soon:

 Is there a way or a library (I use Python but can use R as well) that helps me extract the main idea for each input that's (for example) longer than certain amount of characters?
 Any idea or suggestion helps, at the end of the day, I might be doing this for a living in a couple of years!!

 My questions is, is there a transition in the industry from using Data Scientists who would do abit of data analytics/business intelligence/data engineering/ML to companies specifically employing those in these specific roles. Or are there simply less jobs out there for Data Scientists?

I'm in the agricultural field so people here mostly use R, but I want to be able to work with Python as well. Not for the more classical stuff like mixed models and what not, but I've read that Python is used more often for deep learning.

Sure, Winston takes the train once or twice, but no cars? I would have thought the generally envisioned future of the 40's included car-ridden roads. Was this novel even more ahead of its time than I thought?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi First of all, thank you for all you are sharing here; it has helped me a lot.
 I am an electronic engineer and data science has really caught my attention. I was using basic things in my current job (cleaning, preprocessing, and statistics only) and in the last few months I have been learning from many courses about a variety of algorithms, some basic neural nets, and so on. 
 At first, I tried (unsuccessfully) taking notes in Qmarkdown/Obsidian, but the effort and time it took made me comment or document the code better (why I chose that x theorem, conclusions, etc.). 
 I tried to "organize" this information (I use Python notebooks) but I have multiple ways of saving code depending on the source (GitHub for personal, Colab GDrive for Udemy, Kaggle, etc.). So when I tried to find, for example, X code for X theorem, it is not easy to find because I have the same in multiple files, for example. At that moment, I thought, "Why am I not taking notes?" 
 Thank you once again (yes maybe too long); I think it is too personal in some point, but I really think what works (or not) for you will help me.
 Regards
 Sebastian

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have already seen the capabilities of AI sourcing from the Internet to create, learn, and exceed our expectations. 
 I want to be quick with my description so I don't loose anybody. 
 The next step I believe will be AI catered to us individually. What I mean is an app that only cares for one person, that being you. It will comb over (with permission hopefully) everything you ever put online. Also track writting, Grammer, interests (internet of things information), about you. Then if you allow it, can go over your medical or financial history, even psychology. It will feel like a chatbot but be a middleman towards seeking healthcare, mental care, and may other things including niché interests and possible career routes. 
 I don't propose this to invite any fear or anxiety of a sci-fi narrative, but to objectively observe the trends with AI and my belief where it is going.

I currently work as a Digital Marketer doing PPC, Paid Social and SEO. And I am looking to dive deeper into Digital Marketing with more Data oriented approaches. Self thought myself(Coursera, Youtube) python language and I am currently very comfortable doing DA on python.(Incredibly insightful, almost feels like superpower for a Marketer, cohort analysis etc.).
 What education path do recommend to be able to apply more advanced data modeling on customer behavior, and possibly land a job as marketing Analyst ?
  
Elite University bootcamps? Reviews say that they are rather scammy, and taught by 3rd party institutions.
 Coursera Edx? Feels like they scratch the surface, and you have to figure it out yourself, also not too appreciated by recruiters.
 Udacity, Datacamp, Ironhack ... ? Same as MOOCs or are they better?
 Actual Masters Degree? All universities are asking for > 50.000USD
  
With endless online choices, scam program advertiser, and also nonsense posters on social media(even on reddit) I am confused who to believe.
 Any insight is highly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm interested in taking a local, human-run workflow and moving it to an automated cloud workflow. I have a seemingly solid grasp of the individual components; it's the design choices and integration (at a high level) that I'm thinking about here. (Also, I see Rule 7, but this seems a bit abstract for what usually works well on SO.)
 I have some code, mostly in notebooks, that pulls data from a few sources (e.g., scraping, APIs), preps it, and writes it out. Then, in other notebooks, I read it in and do some analysis.
 Here's what I'm thinking so far:
  
Retrieval: Serverless functions (i.e. Azure Functions). I haven't used it, but it seems straightforward to kick these off on a timer and pass it on.
 Pre-processing: Serverless functions to clean the data for storage, with output inserted into a DB. 
 Q: Should this be integrated to the prior step? It's highly-structured data, so it may not need a lot of maintenance on its own.
 Q: If not, should I pass data in here with a queue or some other cloud functionality, or use file storage and a trigger?
 
 Storage: Persistent SQL DBMS as a service.
 Front end: TBD (web interface), but essentially abstracted from the backend, because it queries the general purpose data storage (and makes analytic-specific transformations either within query or after retrieval).
  
General questions:
  
Are there good resources on the big picture view? Most of my searching has turned up material on the individual components.
 This project (somewhat of a proof of concept) is on the smaller side (1-2GB of data), so are there simplifications that work well at that scale?
 Is there an easy way to have these components deploy from a Github repo? For example, when I push a commit, I'd like the serverless functions to use that newest version.
  
Happy for any advice, ideas, and links to things I can read up on. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, 
 I'm tasked with the following:
 At our attraction, you can either pay for day admission or become a member for unlimited visits within that year. Is there a point where one cannibalizes the other? Should we keep pushing for more members or cap it at a certain point?
 On the surface, this sounds like an easy question, however, I'm getting lost in pulling my data. From 2018 - now I can pull everything and am currently thinking I'm pulling too much data. Should I be looking at this question through a different lens?

Odigos is an open-source project that lets you instantly generate distributed traces for your applications. It works alongside existing monitoring tools and does not require any code changes.
Our earlier experiences with monitoring tools were frustrating. Monitoring a distributed system with multiple microservices, we found ourselves spending way too much time trying to locate the specific microservice that was at the root of a problem. For example, we once spent hours debugging an application which we suspected was causing high latency, only to find out that the actual problem was rooted in a completely different application
Then we learned about distributed tracing, which solves exactly this problem.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern datasets contain hundreds of thousands to millions of labels that must be kept accurate. In practice, some errors in the dataset average out and can be ignored – systematic biases transfer to the model. After quick initial wins in areas where abundant data is readily available, deep learning needs to become more data efficient to help solve difficult business problems.
 MLfix is a new open-source tool that combines novel unsupervised machine-learning pipelines with a new user interface concept that, together, help annotators and machine-learning engineers identify and filter out label errors.

Even if the modeling is just building regression models, do junior analysts get to “move up” to this? Or would they need a MS in statistics or data science to move up to more technical roles?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if this question in basic. I understand that they're the ones who handle data before it reaches any data science/engineering teams. But it's still pretty confusing. if those guys are incharge of cleaning up the data, where to Database Admins/devs come in the picture. is there any pictictional representation for how each role is related to the entire data lifecycle journey? 
 I'm on a data literacy project and need help figuring out how they relate to one another

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of all the states of a DS project, I seemed to enjoy modelling and it's subsequent deployment, monitoring etc. the most. I don't think fresh grads are taken for this role. So what do you think will be ideal for me to start my career with if I ultimately aim to go in that direction? 
 Data Engineering- Is practically software engineering working with data. Also will know the data really well. May have some Spark, SQL and Cloud experience which will come in handy.
 Backend Developer- Is fine with me but I have zero interest in frontend and it's hard to get only backend jobs (that too in Flask/Django). Also fear that ultimately will move away from my ML career.
 Data Analyst- Don't think this is optimal. Correct me if I'm wrong.
 These are all my understandings. Please share your more experienced ones.
 I can't become a Data Scientist now because practically all job listings require a Masters' which I can't pursue due to financial and time constraints now.
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I realise the irony of coming here looking for advice about job hunting after just now seeing the post from the poster that was laid off at Amazon. If they read this, good luck friend! 
 ​
 As the title, I am just about to finish my masters and it has been a really rough experience. Academically, I had the chops, but my personal life has had alot of ups and downs the last few years. My wife was very sick, recovered, got sick again, we had a baby in the middle and she almost got sick a third time. It took a toll. 
 ​
 I was an English language teacher back in 2018 when I realised that I couldn't see a future in that and so I had better start working on something I thought I not only had an aptitude for but that had potential for an actual career track to pursue. So here I am, battered and bruised but soon to have the certificate in my bloodied hands, 10 KG heavier with a 6 month old baby that has kept me from having a full night's sleep in literally 6 months. 
 ​
 The issue is this, I haven't had to job hunt in 10 years, not only that, I last job hunted in person in schools in my city and quickly got a job after meeting the manager of a school. I will have to navigate a whole new world of jobs and interview skills in about 6 weeks. Does anyone have any general advice on where to start this? How could I build a resume with 15 years of teaching experience as my background and a masters? 
 ​
 What can I be doing while the likely long job hunt process begins to solidify my skills that were not as well taught as they perhaps could have been? Kaggle competitions? The Odin project? A portfolio of projects of my own? Pratice coding tests for inevitable interview tasks?
 ​
 Any and all advice welcome! I am soon to join your ranks (one hopes), I hope to one day be in a position to pass this advice along to the next person who needs it.

 Number Of Parameters GPT-3 vs. GPT-4
 The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.
 People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a trillion with a “t”.
 The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.
 Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!
 But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).
 Let’s go!
 Training 100 Trillion Parameters
 The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone [1].

Unfortunately, none of the options of degrees are for CS, CE or SWE. I am assuming that I am better off choosing one of these degrees and finding a way to become a SWE rather than paying/taking out loans just so that my masters degree says CS on it. As such, out of these two which would be a better pick? I keep seeing that DS likely has more crossover but the CIS degree happens to have 9 credits of specialization in which I can chose “software development”. TYIA.

 I was one of them, laid off from Amazon after 2.5 years there. Anybody else here in the same boat?
 Anyway iv been thinking about how this all went down and what I'd do differently to future proof my career.. will share a longer post tomorrow. Today's been a long day.
 Update 1- just getting started and will slowly reply to comments..I'm generally upbeat about the turn of events and that's why I said it warrants a separate post I'll hopefully write today. 
 For now, here is my outlook moving forward- I plan on focusing on work life balance, following my interests and building my personal portfolio. I'm lucky enough to not have immediate financial worry, the larger issue is my H1B visa. But I have options..
 The larger impact this has had in my outlook towards my career and how my employer doesn't define it. 
 Ps-I'll be sharing my journey on twitter if folks want to follow (@sangyh2).
 Update 2: for other folks laid off or needing a resume review or interview tips, I can help. Ping me here or on twitter.

Eventually, I would like to become a data scientist. I didn’t major in any math/statistics major in college (Information Technology) so don’t have much prior knowledge other then minimal python/sql knowledge. I also am planning to do masters in data analytics/data science after two years of my job. What are the most important things to learn? And is doing the masters worth especially considering I won’t have prior education in data science other than self-learn?
