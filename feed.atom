Does anyone have any insight into this? Is there any way to use it currently? I've worked with Stable Diffusion through A1111, would there be a model that works with A1111? Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I went back to university this year to do an M.Sc and specialize in machine learning with a focus on computer vision. My university has pretty good collaboration between departments, and because of that, funding sometimes gets weird for projects. In this case, the perfect project for me happened to be under the department of mechanical engineering (although we collaborate with CS and other departments). My focus is 100% on computer vision, but when I graduate with my master's, it will technically be a degree in mechanical engineering. Weird, I know.
 Does anyone see any issues with this? I had planned on just saying during my job search that I did an M.Sc in Machine Learning since it's both my study and research focus, and in my opinion, the department is irrelevant, but I got to thinking that it may not be that simple and wanted to toss the question out there.

 So far, I've been accepted for a PhD-level data science internship at my dream FAANG company, but I've also been extended an offer for a full-time data science job at a company with subpar compensation and benefits. My ultimate goal is of course to work at my dream company. To achieve it, would it be better to take the job and gain full-time data science experience or take the internship with the hopes of conversion?

 I am new to DS and I would like to keep up with the current technology and inventions in the DS sector. By far the best source for this has been reddit! I tried to google 'popular/best data science magazines' but all the results suggested online blogs and websites. I dont mind subscribing to them, but I enjoy reading an actual offline magazine made of paper more. Is there any such offline magazine that you recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been working as a data analyst for about a year, and I’m interested in moving towards a data engineering role in the future. It seems like everything in the data engineering domain is gravitating towards python. I’m probably already an intermediate-level python programmer, but I kind of want to learn a compiled language to help me get a better appreciation for what happens with the hardware. Preferably, I’d like to spend my time learning a language that’s still used in the field too. So far, I’ve landed on Java, Scala and C++. 
 Again, my main goal here is just learning for sake of learning and becoming a better programmer in general, but I also don’t want to commit my time to learning the syntax of a dying language. Anyone have any thoughts or recommendations?

 I am trying to learn about Intelligent Document Processing
 Need to build a automation tool to find some words in documents in pdf/word format
 Make a check list about what was found 
 These documents are digitalizations from a scanner 
 Some documents have 900 pages or more, and some have bad quality digitalizations from decades ago (probably need to setup a database for each word)
 I know there's several which can do that job, but I am looking for something more accessible, these available are too expensive targeting enterprises 
 Any guidance would be very helpful!

I see posts from people suggesting to others to stand their ground and tell management and their leadership that their way is the best way, that they are the data scientist and know best. I see similar posts telling people to be unwavering and uncompromising in their communication. I see posts where it is clear people have no tight deadlines and a seemingly unlimited budget. I see posts where people can seemingly focus all their time and energy working on models and ignoring all SQL, data cleaning or data wrangling work. I see posts where people seem to have access to perfectly clean data at all times.
 Is this sub filled with students and junior folk who have yet to experience the real world? Or have I only experienced companies where sometimes "good enough is ok", where we have to bend to budget and time constraints, where we have to sacrifice complex analysis for a simple one which is understandable by stakeholders, where data is a pile of trash, where you spend the bulk of your time doing donkey work.
 Curious to hear everyone's thoughts here.

 ​
 i recently started a project, for which I want to categorize the answers given by a human patient to a question asked by an AI to a category. Example:
 AI: Are you currently smoking?
 Patient: No, but I smoked until last september. I t was quite a decent amount, but I stopped, and havnt touched a cigarette since.
 Detected Category: No
 ​
 I have searched far and wide for a dataset containing medical consultations with data annotated in that way, but havent found any.
 ​
 How would you think is the best way to adress something like this without having to start collecting data? 
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has seen tremendous progress. In particular, algorithms for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) are evolving and improving at a stunning pace. Systems that seemed like science fiction as recently as ten years ago are now commonplace. One such system is GPT-3 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3), a state-of-the-art model capable of generating human-like text for a wide range of tasks, such as conversation modeling, summarization, and question answering. 
 In this live webinar Stanford Professor Christopher Potts will discuss the significance and implications of recent Natural Language Understanding developments including GPT-3. He will outline the fundamental building blocks of these new systems and describe how we can reliably assess and understand them.
 Topics will include:
  
Technical capabilities, limitations, and applications of new Natural Language Understanding systems
 
Analysis of the performance of GPT-3 on various language tasks
 
Potential future developments in Natural Language Processing

 1.) Given my background would you recommend doing a MS in comp sci or stats for a career in data science. 
 2.) Considering I’ve been able to get a job as a Data Scientist is it even worthwhile?
 P.S. I’m looking to do a masters to gain knowledge in the chosen field and potentially get a top uni on my CV which may open doors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm running a bunch of ML models using sklearn, with pycharm. I have to run over 200 Random Foresst models. It should take around 12 hours by my calculation which is fine by me to run it over night. However after my macbook falls asleep, the models eventually stop running, so I come back a few hours later and find that only a few models have been run instead of all of them. The only way I can overcome this is to constantly every few minutes, attend to me laptop and reactivate the screen. But there must be a way to configure the laptop to continue running the script at its optimal rate? Does anyone have an idea? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently work as a Data Scientist at a Fintech in London. The work is average but the team is great, we're really clicked as a team. The only downside is the pay (63K). I know it's an alright salary, especially because I live in the countryside so I don't have the high cost of living in London.
 I got offered a job as Lead BI analyst from a 3 year old start-up. It's an interesting offer as I would be their first technical hire and the right hand of the CTO helping him build the whole infrastructure required before hiring new analysts and further down the road more a few scientists. The company 's stock hasn't gone through the hyper-growth yet so their offer of having stocks options form day 1 is quite tempting. Also they offered 80K plus a ton of benefits.
 Financially it's clearly a good offer, but I'm interesting to see if you guys feel that as a career this could be a downgrade?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read an article about neural search and for those who don’t know, it’s a way for computers to find stuff using these special programs called neural networks. It can be used in lots of different ways, like searching the web, or helping you find things on your computer. 
 It can also find things that are close to what we're looking for. It can even search through images, audio, and video. Sometimes it's even better to use a combination of Neural Search and other methods to get the best results.
 Sounds a lot like something Google Search would do? But from what I understand, Google uses "artificial neural networks" to try and understand what we are looking for and find the best websites for it. But I think Google also uses lots of other ways to help us find what we are looking for, so it's not just using the neural networks.
 Anyone know the difference?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I was wondering about the encoding/quantizing of meteorological information. I currently have wind speed estimation computed from satellite observations. I know that we have a RMSE of 1 m/s between this estimation and the true wind speed.
 One issue I have with these data is their size: I want to try to be create as small file as possible to simplify I/O operations. Let's imagine several situations:
  
encode them on 8-bits data between 0 and 25.6 m/s, this means that we can't distinguish speed difference lower than 0.1 m/s.
 
encode them on 8-bits data between 0 and 51.2 m/s, with a minimal speed difference of 0.2 m/s.
 
encode them on 9-bits between 0 and 51.2 m/s, with a minimal speed difference of 0.1 m/s.
 
 Solution (1) and (2) can be stored in 8-bits PNG files. (3) can be stored in 16-bits PNG files, but I'm confident the compression scheme would reduced the filesize quite well -though it is quite a dirty & roundabout way-. This also keep the advantage than PNG files can be previewed in the file browser.
 So, here is the question: If I know the RMSE between my estimation and the truth value of the wind speed is 1 m/s, is it necessary to keep a quantization of 0.1 m/s?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a company problem to generate demand forecast. So I used historical data and used Sarima (to account for seasonality) and neural prophet to generate forecast and averaged both models prediction, it gave close to real value.
 But, another requirement was given to add pre-booking to the model. Since pre-booking is a future variable, I used it as future covariate model (exog).
 Another issue, was that pre-booking is usually not present that far into the future (2 week) and to generate 2 week forecast , the pre-booking should be known.
 To tackle, this problem I used a cascade model.
 Model 1 - Using pre-booking historical data , I first generated pre-booking forecast 2 weeks into the future.
 Model 2 - The generated pre-booking forecast by model 1 was used as covariate to generate true demand prediction.
 Also, in both model I'm using features - day of the week, weekend or not.
 The final demand prediction varies and I feel it's too messy. Is there an alternative method or is my netgid correct?
 What all can be improved? Any suggestions are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, recently my company has asked us to look into how we can calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV). Our company is a kind of cashback App. You buy products from certain partners and we reward you with Coins, which you can then redeem. 
 I know how to get the average lifespan of a customer, but being able to determine how much revenue each one of them brings is tricky. The way we generate revenue is through paid partnerships, in which brands pay us to promote their products, clients purchase said products and we award them with coins. Also, there are campaigns that are self-funded, meaning no brand paid us, all coins awarded came from our pockets. 
 Any ideas or suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I am a student and have been very interested in the ways the bias can be removed from ML datasets, and I have some ideas of how bias could hypothetically be reduced but am by no means an expert. I would greatly appreciate any feedback, recommendations, or additions to some of the ideas that I currently have. 
 Right now, it seems that there is no specific way to completely remove bias from ML datasets, but I have been attempting to create a hypothetical design or a process to prevent bias as much as possible.
 First off, the quality of the raw data is really the most important part of machine learning datasets, but collecting good data is more of a statistical problem. Based on what the learning model is trying to do, you would need to consult with statisticians on determining the qual…]]></summary>
