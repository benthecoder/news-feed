So I was wondering what you guys would use. Just the modeling part. No feature extraction or missing values imputation. Just the modeling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys.
 I'm a former Data Scientist, and I feel really comfortable doing Python stuff and providing value for the business. But in my recent job I just build the model, push the repo and then the MLOPS take care of the infrastructure and things more related to deployment.
 I think the tendency in the market is that we are transitioning to roles where the DS can do and end to end project. My question is, any resource online where I can start learning about deployment? Or am I overexagerating with deployment and being able to let the repo ready for deployment is all that is needed?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a VAE architecture and a dataset, say CIFAR-10, if the hidden/latent space is intentionally kept large to (say) 1000-d, I am assuming that the VAE will automatically not use the extra variables/dimensions in latent space which it does not need. The unneeded dimensions don't learn anything meaningful and therefore remain a standard, multivariate, Gaussian distribution. This serves as a signal that such dimensions can safely be removed without significantly impacting the model's performance.
 I have implemented quite a few of them which can be referred to here.
 Am I right with my hypothesis? Is there any research paper substantiating my hand wavy hypothesis?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, I am about 10 years removed from my PhD in economics. I have some experience doing econometric analysis, primarily using Stata, and can do a little bit in R. I am thinking of applying for a sabbatical this year, to give my self time to complete a data science certificate. I am curious what people think would be the most valuable use of my time. I am not new to data, so don't want to start with the basics. I'd also like to do something that still allows me to use Stata to some degree. Any thoughts out there as to which path to take?
 Summary: I have a Phd in Economics, and am not new to data. I am looking for advice on good big data certification to complete in the next year during a sabbatical.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can anyone explain training, backtesting/validation and testing when working with time series. What are the best practices? is validation always necessary? (for instance when deciding what window to use in a rolling average).
 Also how can we do backtesting if we dont have enough data. Let's say we want to predict the sales per month of a certain product for the next 12 months and we only have 6 months of data?
 ​
 I am confused with all these questions? if you can help by explaining or sharing resources that would be amazing. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I don't have much of a background in data science, but I'm interested in doing some analyses for fun on a data set I have.
 Long story short:
  
I have a set of 3d matrices that represent physical systems (basically point clouds). 
 
I have a certain routine that generates vectors that can describe certain physical properties of the systems represented by the 3d matrices. This routine always generates the same sized property vector, independent of system matrix size. There are multiple 3d system matrices that can yield the same property vector.
 
I want to determine which elements of the 3d system matrices have the greatest effect on each of the elements of the property vectors.
 
 I've seen principle component analysis used in fields other than my own to conduct similar sorts of analyses, and my intuition is to start there. However, I'm not confident that this would work and would appreciate any feedback or advice!
 Thank you in advance and please let me know if this isn't the right sub for this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In college I did a month long experiment where I only used my computer's terminal emulator to do all my work. I wrote my code/notes in Vim, browsed the web with elinks, and wrote my emails using mutt. It was a great learning experience.
Recently I looked into doing this again and ran into a bunch of issues:
- My company uses Slack's enterprise auth, and all the CLI slack clients I could find haven't been updated in years and no longer work.
- The web is using more javascript than in the past.
- Mutt doesn't handle multiple email accounts natively for work/personal. The solutions are hacks at best. Email servers are starting to use more complete auth mechanisms that don't work well with mutt.
It seems like the terminal world is slowly getting abandoned in favor of proprietary GUI apps. Anyone still living inside the terminal? Links to tools for Slack are appreciated.

 Bonus points if you meet up in person once a year at a conference or just to get together.
 EDIT: If not, would anyone be interested in starting one? I'm happy to oversee it, but I'm newer in the Data Science field, so I would like help with more experienced professionals to make sure it would be beneficial for all areas of expertise

At my internship I worked with managers who called themselves the word “data scientist” when they didn’t even know the assumptions of linear regression. To me a data scientist is a person whose grounded in statistical theory and is a statistician at heart but is able to work with nontechnical business units to provide value. However, it seems nowadays data scientists can even be considered people who write excel formulas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy Friday friends, after my many months of searching and encouraging words from the sub, I've managed to land an interview on the above role and am getting much nerves about it!
 I've headed my own bootstrap startup's data functions in the past, and have previous experience as a corporate actuary, but never both at once. Regardless, the scope, management and technicals of the role fall within my capability so should be alright, just have never framed it like that for someone before.
 While I may know and frequently use some of the good practices and advice often posted on this sub about how to be a good DS, this question is more about what should one say at an interview to be impressive to be taken on for the role?
 What sorts of questions should one prepare? Appreciate long replies too. No wet blanket comments please! Many thanks to all! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I find it's such a drag. Just curious if anyone actually enjoys them.
 When I'm engaged and doing work I enjoy, I get stuff done. And I'm happy to give updates on progress. But the daily stand-up feels like being micromanaged, which I have a strong aversion to.
 It's just one of several project management styles, right?
 EDIT: great discussion so far and thanks to those of you who pointed out it's important to discuss roadblocks and also in a time of remote work, the PM needs to keep track of who is doing what. 
 Some of you feel that it doesn't need to be daily but a few times a week can suffice. I think this would be a happy middle ground. 
 I think we can all agree they should be short and to the point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was told this would be a Data Analyst role. I mainly chose a DA role since it contributes to DA/DS work experience and its easy to combine with studies (I'm doing an MSc in CS after a CS undergrad). Upon joining I figured out they actually meant "Data Analyst Engineer", whatever that even means. Tasks range from optimizing bootstrapping scripts, to modifying and deleting DB columns/merging stuff. Writing logic for processing data in Pyspark, etc.
 My main interest was doing some job that is not heavy on the coding side of things and gain some experience for my eventual transfer to a DS role.
 What do you guys think of this, any pros in this, aka. is a DE role I described useful for DS role in the future?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While there are plenty of BI tools, ranging from Metabase to Tableau, these are generally good for sharing KPI dashboards and projects with more finite scope (tracking, standard RCA, etc) ; how do you share results for all the ad-hoc analysis to business teams, where the data is mostly processed in r/Python (aggregations, simple clustering work, multiple views - all exploratory)? Do you guys prefer markdown documents? Is there a better way to do it? Like, hosting Jupyter/something instance on cloud (we use AWS) where its easier to refresh analysis and doing modifications during the brainstorming discussions (similar to quick excel analysis that often happens in business meetings - assuming there's a proficient analyst who can work on simple queries on the go)?

 Do you see AI as being able to offset this and allow the economies of countries like these to continue to grow in this decade and the next?
 I'm not sure if anyone has written about this.
