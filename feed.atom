        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 When I was finishing my BSc, I got some splendid advice from reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/mrgoh2/jobs_in_quantitative_finance_for_math_student/), now I'm about to finish my MSc and I'm back for more :D
 I still like coding and statistics, but I don't really see myself in finance anymore, although i don't rule it out completely (I still find it interesting, but i'm not sure this is the industry i want to contribute to, if you know what i mean). I would honestly rather do something in data science. I worked with neural networks (with python, pytorch) in some projects and I found that really interesting. 
 So far I had one interview as "data science consultant" and it really didn't go well, so I didn't get invited for the second interview. (It was one of my first interviews ever, so it's ok.) I would like to apply to more data science positions, but i don't really find any. I heard from colleagues at uni and online that there are not many positions open in this field right now.
 Now I have an offer as software engineer. Would it be a good idea to start this way? As i mentioned i have a math background, so i guess it wouldn't hurt to have get some experience in writing nice code. My fear is that I get stuck in software engineering and don't really get to apply anything i learned in my studies of mathematics, which would be a big waste. Or is that a wrong outlook?
 I have 3-4 months until i could start with the job. What would you do? Should i try to get something in data science or is it hopeless at the moment? Would you start as software engineer? or would you recommend something completely different to me? I'm not sure what to do, any piece of advice is greatly appreciated!

 According to the job description, the role includes working with process optimization issues and process mining methodology (eg Celonis) and also some more typical data analysis tasks.
 Does anyone of you do this kind of job? How does it compare to a more general Data Scientist role? I think I'm a little worried that I won't be working on more general and common Data Science/ML tasks, which might affect my future job opportunities. Thanks for your input!

Think of Nihongo Lessons as the textbook to Nihongo’s dictionary. It’s an app for learning Japanese, specifically made for learners who are serious about becoming fluent, and want a guided set of content that will help them efficiently acquire vocabulary and grammar.
The project came about when Adam Shapiro of Japanese Level Up (Jalup) [1] announced last April that he was shutting Jalup down. As a fan of Adam’s work I was bummed to hear the news, but realized I actually might be one of the few people in the world in a position to keep his work alive.

 From what I have read and from my experience. You can have:
  
Different test case scenarios (eg, how a temperature forecasting model performs when it rains a lot) and compare their accuracy to that of a test set
 Check if your model performs with outliers, missing data etc.
  
Other than this I am a bit clueless.

 You can find the link to the application below. You still have about a week to apply and they are looking for people from all across the creative and tech sector to apply. 
 INTELLIGENT MACHINERY
 HXOUSE LABS PRESENTS INTELLIGENT MACHINERY- a program focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Composed of panels and technical and philosophical workshops, the program touches on everything from current innovations in natural language image generation and automated vehicles, to future scenarios dealing with artificial general intelligence and super intelligence.
 INTELLIGENT MACHINERY will welcome talented individuals from diverse backgrounds and experience levels to participate in groundbreaking workshops developed in collaboration with the world's leading companies. Through this novel programming HXOUSE LABS will enable and activate a new generation of innovation in the world's most important technical fields. 
 FAKING IT, MAKING IT
 Faking It, Making It is a technical workshop that will explore the latest deep fake technologies with a pioneer in the field, Carl Bogan, a.k.a Myster Giraffe. Carl will delve into his creative process, from ideation and narrative building, preparing assets, sourcing content, and training deep fake models, to processing faked footage and compositing final content.
 Deep fakes have been in the news for around a decade; First known for its nefarious use in pornography and espionage, the technology has developed into an everyday part of our entertainment through film and televison, and online content creation.
 The ambition of the workshop is to equip Tenants with knowledge and experience to develop in this new, exciting, and controversial, creative field. This is a two- day workshop that will take place on December 10th and 11th, from 9am to 6pm.

 Machine learning progress is plagued by the conflict between competing ideas, with no shortage of failed reviews, underdelivering models, and failed investments in expensive over-engineered solutions.
 We don't subscribe the Deep Learning hype for time series and present a fully reproducible experiment that shows that:
  
A simple statistical ensemble outperforms most individual deep-learning models.
 A simple statistical ensemble is 25,000 faster and only slightly less accurate than an ensemble of deep learning models.
  
In other words, deep-learning ensembles outperform statistical ensembles just by 0.36 points in SMAPE. However, the DL ensemble takes more than 14 days to run and costs around USD 11,000, while the statistical ensemble takes 6 minutes to run and costs $0.5c.
 For the 3,003 series of M3, these are the results.
 ​

 In conclusion: in terms of speed, costs, simplicity and interpretability, deep learning is far behind the simple statistical ensemble. In terms of accuracy, they are rather close.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently work as a Data Analyst at one of the leading private banks banks in my country. I really enjoy the job because it has tons of learning involved. Even though I am a data analyst my typical job role dictates only 20 % of the time catering to Ad-hoc analytics task which mainly involves SQL, while the greater chunk of the time I'm involved in ML model building, Model monitoring and Model Tuning. Being a bank the modeling approach typically involves Logistic regression, CART & Boosting/ensemble models. But I want to expand my work and learning into broader areas of AI/ML and ultimately aim for a Data Scientist role. 
 So, what is the best learning/skill enhancement path to follow in order to switch to a DS role? Is it tough to switch into a DS role from DA role? I need some help.

I currently work with someone who hasn’t written a single line of code and keeps doing “research work” for future work. When we do team coding sessions they seem clueless. Go on mute and don’t contribute. It’s kind of impressive how long they’ve been skating by. Just wondering if this is common in the industry.
