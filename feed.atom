        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to do clustering and then use that as a feature to improve the accuracy of my Multi class classifier. The dataset I am dealing with is Numerical and everything is encoded but my accuracy is not improving much after feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning. I am using XGboost classifier for my model. If anyone can guide me on how I can use clustering as a feature for my classification model , I would be extremely grateful, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My plan is to become a data scientist. So what I do first is to apply as a data analyst in companies. But one company called me and offered me a data governance position. Since I am a fresh graduate and it seems no one is currently accepting me as a data analyst, is it better to take this offer? If I do, how could I job hop or career shift in a data analyst role? Because based on what I've searched, the data governance role are more talking to people and securing/controlling the distribution of data and more of using flowcharts. I just hope I can also apply statistical test or dashboards for data visualization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I’ve been going to university for computational physics (physics and computer science degree in one) and I’ve been looking into data science. At my current job I was working part-time in order to focus on school. They’ve recently gotten rid of the part-time position and now I have to work full-time. The problem is it’s a 10 hour night shift position with an hour of commute to and from home. I’m away from home for at least 12 hours of the day and have time to really only tackle one or two classes. 
 I was hoping I could pick up a part-time position in the analytical world so I could finish school quicker while also gaining experience in a field I’m interested in. What kind of part time jobs are the in the analytic world for someone like me to get my foot in the door?

Tier is "Terraform for Stripe" but it goes further and gives you feature flag style access checks, and allows you to count/report usage which can be used for metered billing.
When we started Tier, we knew that there was something interesting in the SaaS pricing and packaging space. Adjusting price is the single most effective lever a business can use to achieve product/market fit, and there's a strong correlation price nimbleness and market success.
In spite of overwhelming evidence of this, most startups pick the price for their product once and then never change it, opting instead to invest in less effective levers like CAC, sales efficiency, "virality", churn, etc. Why?…]]></summary>

It stores your shell history in context (what directory you ran the command it, whether it succeeded or failed, how long it took, etc). This is all stored locally and end-to-end encrypted for syncing to to all your other computers. All of this is easily queryable via Control-R and via the hishtory CLI. This means from your laptop, you can easily find that complex bash pipeline you wrote on your server, and see the context in which you ran it.

According to two recent Gartner reports, 85% of AI and machine learning projects fail to deliver, and only 53% of projects make it from prototypes to production.
  
When you spend weeks/months on a project and it gets nowhere, do you try harder ? are you assigned to work on another task ? Do you feel like you're the failure of the company powerless ?
 Or is it just "part of the deal", win some, lose some. 
 I'm also very curious as to how companies that extensively pay data scientists manage to benefit from their employees in case of failures/repeated failure on the long run.

 Seems like a tactic to put pressure on me to do even more work or make me feel uncomfortable for getting paid. 
 Should I just not reply? I am thinking just to ignore the comment and continue, and not to send him any reply, no comebacks. I don't want to be snarky. When there is a problem, I take full responsibility on it even if it's not my own problem, and am always the nicest person. 
 I am the first employee in the startup, and who brings in the most amount of work, consistently, day and night (yes, sometimes working into the night to make deadlines happen when he lets us know the day or two before for work to be done for a big company we're working with). 
 I started with a very low pay for months (barely enough to pay the bills) and just now was promoted, after my insistence, since I had to work in childcare to pay the bills. He is till underpaying, and paying only 70% of what a business data analyst gets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lets say I have a dataset D with n instances and three pre-trained regressors, Ra, Rb and Rc.
 I can run each regressor on D, which will net me a set of predictions Pa, Pb and Pc. How can I measure how much these three regressors "agree" in their predictions?
 For example, if my Y domain is [0,100] and for some instance they predict 10, 11 and 9, I would argue that they 'agree' in their decisions. If, on the other hand, the predictions returned are 1, 99, 30, then they 'disagree'. But this is rather qualitative and subjective, I'm looking for a quantitative metric.
 I guess another way of asking is, how can I measure how close a set of predictions Pa, Pb and Pc are from one another.
 I thought of computing the mean standard deviation on each instance, or maybe the mean KL divergence between all regressor pairs but I'm wondering if there exists a better metric. Maybe something like a kappa score, but for regression.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Folks,
 For any tensorflow developers out there or if you are generally interested in helping I need some help:
 I took the Tensorflow developer specialization on Coursera. I recently completed their 3rd course. I was quite overwhelmed frankly as I had never worked with NLP. I really wanted to stop for a while and develop something of my own as a project to test my knowledge. I stumbled upon this idea of building a disease prediction model last week and I really wanted to get some ideas on my model. I scraped diseases, and their symptoms from internet. Symptoms being separated by commas with no sequential meaning.
  
Some of my symptoms and disease names are multi word, is there any work around for that?
 
I guess using LSTM is quite useless as symptoms are randomly separated by commas so no sequential meaning. Comments?
 
I multiplied my dataset by using symptoms in various combinations for every disease. Is this fine?
 
My approach so far has been to tokenize each symptom. I did not tokenize labels and rather created a dictionary with indexes. This is because some diseases *labels* were multi word so I cannot pass a token array as label.
 
Should I go for one hot encoding rather?
 
 I pass the input through an embedding layer **64 dimension**, Global avg pooling 1D, Dense layer 100 relu activations, and 261 outputs softmax activation.
 I got 90% train and val accuracy. Is this approach right?
 Another thing I wanted to do was to be able to predict symptoms from utterances, any suggestions?
 If anyone is interested, feel free to join in the project

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just popped into my head as I reflect on our marketing team trying to pay a vendor a godawful amount of money for what the vendor literally labels, “off the shelf machine learning models.” The deal, we open the gates to let them exfiltrate data, they use it to train models, they then sell those modes back to us and our competition…
 What I’m realizing now is that there is absolutely no reasonable way they can uphold a delete request from our customers because it would require they retire the old modes, retrain in fresh data, and redeploy to all their other clients. 
 Similarly if there is a request for transparency about what data we have access to and what it’s being used for, if our competition is using models trained on our customers data from our data stores, then who knows how the hell they might be using that…
 And for those curious, they are willing to give away our data assets because they don’t want to wait for our internal teams to make them dashboards using our internal warehousing and data stores. That’s literally it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm developing Hyperstep[0], a spatial language for music production. I find using existing DAWs frustrating because they don't allow me to navigate and operate intuitively on the latent spaces behind my musical ideas. This is why I've decided to build my own set of "seeing tools".(Bret Victor)[1]. I'm also convinced that by framing music as processes and interactions in the 3D world, spatialization and mixing should become fairly pain-free.
I'm still early in development and I would love to build this into an actual product that can be integrated into existing DAWs or even turn it into a musical framework itself for AR and VR experiences.
If you're interested in working on it or if you simply want to know more, feel free to contact me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a personal project I wrote a really tiny Wat 2 Wasm compiler in Go. Mainly for demonstrative and educational purposes. It was tough: I didn't know anything about WebAssembly internals and I'm a newbie with Go... so I tried to document it as much as I could for anyone that would like to approach the quest in the future!
It misses a lot of features (that will be gradually implemented).
Any feedback is welcomed!!

Using our API, developers don’t have to worry about how different chains like Ethereum, Solana, and Flow implement digital assets under the hood. We collect, standardize, and cache all this information for you, so you can retrieve it in a single request.
There has been a lot of controversy and hype around NFTs, but we’re focused on solving the technical challenges that our customers (software developers working with digital assets) deal with on a day-to-day basis. We don’t hold, transfer, mint or issue any form of crypto or digital asset ourselves–instead we aim to be the most comprehensive data…]]></summary>

 My question is : if I wanted to make a correlation test on a sample of the time series, for the purpose of demonstration, would it even be relevant to sample a population of 800 data points? 
 If yes, what method should I use to sample the time series?
 Sorry if this has already been answered or isn't relevant I just can't find it by myself. Any help is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a side project and need to download podcast audio for processing and storage. This, roughly, involves the following steps:
 1) Create an automated way to be notified when a new podcast is released. This can be in the form of receiving an HTTP message or even running a CRON job and checking a few times per day.
 2) Download the mp3 and metadata (date, title, etc.) for the podcast.
 3) Process audio using something like WisperAI.
 4) Store the data for analytics.
 I'm wondering if anyone has recommendations for the above, specifically steps 1 and 2? For example, do you know of any tools (ex: API) I can leverage with Python to get podcast information daily? Or a reliable way to get high-quality audio files for many different podcasts?
 Thanks so much for any assistance here!

 Info includes anything I could get from media like Adweek, Drift, Campaign Bried to Forbes, Google Business, and my company's experience.

 I am asking because I want to compare my Data Science Internship experience. I had the opportunity to work on a lot of cool projects, but in the ML project, I only worked on the Data Collection, EDA, and Data Cleaning phase. I feel like I am at a disadvantage for entry level data scientist positions because I haven't actually produced a model in the professional environment.

 I live in South Korea and am aged 26 and soon 27. I majored in accounting and finance at the university and intended to start my career at the accounting firms. But now I hope to have my own business in AI field. It is because I do have enough knowledge in AI so I cannot build the structure of the business. So I came here to ask to experts(you) about the ideas for a business. 
 It's not like I am gonna do that now but I want to listen to you and learn from you. 
 What would be upcoming trends in AI business and what are your recommendations if you start a business? 
 ​
 Thanks a lot and I appreciate all your opinions :) ><
