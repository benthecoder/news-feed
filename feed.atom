        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After I’ve learnt to deploy a ML model and handle big data using Hadoop and PySpark I need to decide what next. I’m not sure whether to go for the TensorFlow certificate or just to learn airflow/Kafka. I’m unemployed and upgrading my skills. Any advice would be welcome. My primary focus right now is to get employed. This stuff will be done in parallel to job hunting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. To start off I know nothing about data science and am a total noob. I have a personal project I want to work on and am willing to learn, but I don't even know if what I want to do is possible. So I hope this isn't a dumb question
 I want to make a prediction model, however not all of the variables I would use to train it are known. Is this possible?
 For example: Say I am taking different aspects of a house such as the square footage, number of floors, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms and to train a model which predicts the price of the house. However, say there are some homes I don't know the exact square footage of. Is it possible to use an input such as "1000-1500"? If it's not possible, is it realistic to get a good model if I took the average of the min and max in those instances instead? 
 And if this is possible, any info which would put me in the right direction on google would be helpful :)

 My program has all students work on FICO's Xpress Workbench, which uses Mosel as the programming language.
 I'd like to know if the tool / language is used much in practical workplace? If not I can just study as much as the course requires and focus on developing coding skills for other popular languages like Python.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I had previously set up my home server with SSH on a high port, and did the port forwarding thing on the firewall so that I can SSH into this system from elsewhere on the Internet.  It worked fine for months.
And then, it stopped working. The router didn’t have a software update as far as I can see. I re-checked everything, but I just can’t initiate a connection to the server from elsewhere on the Internet. It seems like it is filtered somewhere in the ISP’s network.  I can, and possibly will switch ISPs, but in the mean time, I’m looking at other technical options. Though we use the other main ISP for work, and their uptime in the last couple years has been… less than stellar.
One option is obviously rent a VPS, and set up a VPN or something, and have the home server connect to that at startup.  I can and have done that in the past, but even a low-cost VPS is $10 USD per month.
Some of the VPN providers out there have relatively low-cost multi-year deals, so I was looking at one of those. But it wasn’t clear if any of them supported what I wanted to do. I don’t really need to watch Netflix from a different region, I just want access to my server remotely.
I just wanted to see if anyone else is doing something like this.  Thanks!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys. I've been applying for entry-level data scientist / senior data analyst roles for a month now and the going has been tough. I'm trying to think if there are other careers I can expand into given what I know about data science so far, to enhance my ability to find a job. Obviously data engineering is an option, but also curious about peoples' thoughts about SWE in Data jobs and how hard it would be to make the transition, and what additional knowledge would be required to transition.
 Would be great to hear from people who have made a transition, in particular.
 For some context - I studied economics in undergrad and have 4 years of experience as a data analyst, and recently finished a 2-year masters in data science degree from a Top 10 American University. And I'm getting little hits in the market, even for job titles that I have already had (senior data analyst).

I found these 2 books one for calculus and the other for linear algebra and I'd like to hear from you if these are enough, too much or too little.
 (Last picture is for the calculus book and the rest are for the Linear algebra book)
 I'd really appreciate your help and thank you

 I'm thinking that changing for 10% more salary might not be worth, as probably very quickly in the next months salaries will need to adjust considerably.
 Probably a 25% increase would make it worth? or not even so? I feel like 25% would put me just like the same buying power I had 2 years ago. Nominally making more money, but the buying power will remain the same.
 What's the % for changing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The past three weeks I've been massaging the data a lot to get the best set of clusters to represent the customers we have.
 To start, RFM represents:
  
R = Number of days since last purchase for a given customer relative to today
 F = Total orders made by customer - 1 (we exclude the first order, we only care about repeat purchases)
 M = Average dollar spent across all orders per customer
  
I started with the three as my features, but later expanded and added additional elements such as age of customer, standard deviation between transactions, and average time between transactions.
 My challenge is the frequency data, where the data is extremely right skewed (exponential graph, where 70% of customers representing 2 purchases made, 15% representing 3 purchases made, etc.)
 I think I resolved the skewness with creating a feature that's Log(Monetary x Frequency) - As customers buy more items, the value increases, therefore "pushing away" infrequent customers.
 Management want 3 customer segments categorized as "High, Mid, Low". However, elbow method and Yellow bricks recommended 5 clusters, 
 I've tried three clustering methods:
  
KMeans with all features combined
 Gaussian Mixture Model - I selected this method given the high density of frequency cohorts
 Naive KMeans - take the RFM columns only, and run KMeans for each feature alone. Then find the average of each cluster, and score manually to bucket the clusters into High, Mid, Low (for example, a cluster with low R, high F, and high M gets to be the High Value customer cluster)
  
I want to ask to ask if there's anyone with Customer Analytics that I can consult with on whether there's a benefit to each approach, or if you have recommendations on a different approach

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 Currently, a sophomore and have two offers I'm trying to decide between. One is not technical at all, management consulting at a Big4 firm vs a quantitative analyst role at a financial company (they make tools for investors). 
 I interned with Deloitte freshmen year and really enjoyed consulting work. I'm majoring in data science with a math minor; however, business and general strategy really appeals to me along with interacting with lots of people. I'm not the most technically savvy person in regards with coding, but do enjoy general problem-solving. Not quite sure which to choose... Deloitte is paying approximately $15/hr more though, and I'm a broke college student. 
 Which would be the best for my career progression? Any input is greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I am working with CDXP platforms, i know python, javascript, marketing analytics etc. But i want to go deeper into data science, we are doing predictions, recommendations, analyses and many more things, but on basic level and i want to go deeper into this. I spent 40 hours on dataquest, but i dont have enough money to buy it for 40€ every month.
 I really want to learn as much informations as i can, is to good investement or are there better courses for cheaper/free? I am doing lot of other courses like google data analytics, statistics from edx and more. Can someone maybe share an account with me so i can learn faster? I can share you other courses from my library.
 If anyone has any materials in PDF, please write me a PM. I will be very happy.

I've studied some java and even javascript before deciding to dive deep into data science, so I'm familiarized with IDEs in general. I was just wondering which one is the most used in the market, or even which on would be the best for someone who's just starded learning.

We’re doing our best to hide the customization prompts on the back end so users are able to quickly search for pre-existing generated photos, or create new ones that would ideally work as well.
If we keep going with it, in future versions we’d like to add voting, better tags, and more varied prompts, or maybe whatever you recommend!

The company I was working for was incredibly supportive and I managed to transition to a data analyst role.
 I eventually swapped over to a very large bank where I have been at for almost 5 years now. The bank was also incredibly supportive and sponsored my move from Europe to the US, and I am now living in NYC.
 The role I do is a weird mix of a lot of things: I still do a lot of analysis and work with predictive modelling, but I just as easily also do web app development, task automations, I've built emails and solutions in Python to maintain those emails, worked with UNIX servers, worked on ETL pipelines, a really weird m…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://github.com/leeoniya/uFuzzy"/>
        <updated>2022-09-30T14:44:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN!
I became frustrated with the unpredictible/poor match quality and opaqueness of "relevance scores" in existing fuzzy and fulltext search libs, so I tried something different and this is the result. The main selling point is the result quality / ordering, with best-in-class memory overhead and excellent performance being bonuses. The API is pretty stable at this point, but looking for feedback before committing to 1.0.
TL;DR
The test corpus is a 4MB json file with 162k words/phrases, so give it a second for initial download. You can also drag/drop your own text/json corpus into the UI to try it against your own dataset.
Live demo/compare with a few other libs (there are many more in the codebase, in various states of completion, WIP):
https://leeoniya.github.io/uFuzzy/demos/compare.html?libs=uF...
In isolation for perf assessment:
https://leeoniya.github.io/uFuzzy/demos/compare.html?libs=uF...
To increase fuzziness and get broader results, try setting intraMax=1 (core) and enable outOfOrder (userland):
https://leeoniya.github.io/uFuzzy/demos/compare.html?libs=uF...
Also play with the sortPreset selector to swap out the default Array.sort() for one in userland that prioritizes typehead-ness (the resultset remains identical).
Still TODO:
  - Example of stripping diacritics
  - Example of using non-latin charsets
  - Example of prefix-caching to improve typeahead perf even further
  - Example of poor man's document search (matching multiple object properties)
