Although it would not have tasks same as data analyst/scientist I think there are still areas where I can apply my analyitical skills and learn a lot. Do you think I can use this position to gain knowledge for better data role in the future?

Am I correct? Is there anything else to it? And lastly, is one subset of the other?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I recently started a new job as a data scientist in a small startup of 10 people approx. My team is me and other 4 interns/juniors w/ a few months experience max, all first job (Im also a junior). Since its a small startup our manager is the CEO. The problem is since he is the CEO he doesnt really have any time for us. He is mostly in meetings with investors and were just thrown in the water with the code and the problems. Non of us had a training of more than 1-2 days besides just a recap of the code so far. We try to help each other but theres a limit to how much an intern can help another intern. We spend hours and days on problems that can be solved within minutes and when the CEO does have time for us he just gives us a hint and not actually sitting and helping or directing us, or we discuss on whatsapp and its unbearable to explain a problem like that or he is just confused with his sh*t and starts a nonsense discussion on something which is not the problem. Eventually we get all the heat on why we are not on schedule or why its taking so long.
 Im doing my best to give results but its very hard when Im all by myself as an intern with no one to ask. Beside it I like the work itself (100% pure Data Science), the location, the other interns. But this work culture is very problematic for me and Im afraid I will end up with experience on paper but no actual knowledge or experience.
 Any advice from you guys will be appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started working for a new company which actually has big data. I dont have a senior to ask this and My search made me left even more confused.
 We have a BigQuery table. Includes 8m rows. It is basically a monthly demand, price, and taxonomy data for products. . I am expected to make outlier analysis and try to find seasonal trends on this data. (also train some prediction models) 
 What is the correct platform to process the data? Sure I can send queries using bq python api but i wont be able to get all the rows since it takes so much RAM. And getting partial data wont do since trend analysis needs all data rows. 
 I tried vertex-ai, Opened up 32 gb n1 notebook instance. loading the data to pandas df failed. It crushed runtime. I made couple of tries. 
 I tried using data studio for insight hunt and ploting things. Sure it works but i want to make very different plots to discover the data and data studio is not flexible. i need to write absurdly long sql queries to accomplish something simple. 
 What am I missing here? I know dealing with big data is basic for data engineer but I never get to learn it and now i am struggling. I checked tutorials and none of them are actually using real big data. GCP tutorials always get data using "LIMIT 10000" type of codes. 
 Maybe what I need is spark? i am not sure.. 
 Is there anyone who can tell me the mistake I am doing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I wanted to pick your brains on any project management or tracking tools you use in your day to day data science roles. 
 A little background, I work on a small 3 person team, with each of us working on our own individual projects. We do a lot of smaller ad-hoc analytical projects for the organization at large, and we're quite siloed in our work. There's almost zero overlap between our analytical/DS projects. We haven't been able to find a satisfactory project management software or methodology that fits our needs - currently we're using a huge/messy kanban board that our boss manages through Azure DevOps - it is far from ideal since it seems to be geared towards larger agile development teams working on a single project. Our projects are small but numerous, with each having multiple parts. We're using sprints to represent projects, and stories to represent tasks within each project - as you can probably guess, it gets quite messy. I think we'd benefit from something geared towards the solo developer/analyst (since that's basically what we are from a work perspective). Something a little more guided/managed than github docs, but not as as managed Azure DevOps. 
 Do you have anything that you'd recommend that you use for work, or even your own solo projects? Thanks in advance!
 Edit: Added details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yitang Zhang, the mathematician behind the 2013 breakthrough on bounded gaps in primes, posted to the arxiv today a result which (if correct) comes close to proving the nonexistence of Landau--Siegel zeros: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02515.
To give a sense of the scale of this claim: If correct, Zhang's work is the most significant progress towards the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis in a century. Moreover, I think this result would not only be a more significant advance than Zhang's previous breakthrough, but also constitute a larger leap for number theory than Wiles' 1994 proof of Fermat's Last Theorem (which was, in my opinion, the greatest single achievement by an individual mathematician in the 20th century).
Some discussion / explanation of Siegel zeros and Zhang's claim can be found here:

An account of Zhang's remarkable story (and his previous breakthrough) can be found here. Famously, prior to his breakthrough, he worked at Subway and lived in his car:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At this point, I have studied a lot of things such about data analytics. I also know the life cycle of data IN THEORY only. I am quite afraid that a lot of things I am not expecting to do will mentally block me in performing my job thoroughly. The job position requires the usage of excel, sql, alteryx, tableau, and possibly python/R. I have practiced my skills in all of these except for the alteryx. Any tips and advices you can provide for me? and what phase of the data cycle should I always watch out for? Thank you for any answers!

 I’ve been tasked to track changes in fuel efficiency for my company’s vehicle fleet. We will be tweaking engine parameters, in hopes this will improve MPG. Leadership wants to quantify this change. I have daily data on fuel efficiency.
 My concern is that this improvement will not be visibly noticeable. MPG fluctuates naturally day by day, and I believe this natural fluctuations would obscure a small improvement in MPG. Does anyone have any input on best approach here? Right now, I’m thinking the best approach is to decompose the time series and extract trend.
 Edit: I’ve considered stat testing, but the change in observed variable is going to be tiny (~3%) Not enough to reject a null given observation count

 Would it give the same result as if I do it multivariate such as MD, MCD?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 this is a bit atypical in this sub, but I am really wondering how people are dealing with it. I started getting into machine learning because I was absolutely fascinated by some of its applications: prediction of stuff, image recognition, self driving, image generation... I mean there are tons of applications out there.
 I managed to land a job where my time is split between building models for marketing like sales leads and churn models. After a few years I feel like my curiousity has been going down more and more.
 I still enjoy coding, but I am not really excited anymore about the problem at hand. It always more of the same in slightly different clothes.
 I realized that there is little that cannot be done with just XGBoost and ome common sense when defining your dataset. If that doesn't work it's probably not worth it my time anyway and it's time to move and and find another problem or another angle.
 My main issue is that I don't feel like I am on auto pilot either. Each dataset has its own pecularity and you still need brain power to understand how is the data generated, what are the outliers, why are there outliers and the 1000 little things that can go wrong with your assumptions/code.
 Should I start reading more papers? Do more toy projects? Go on a vacation? Close reddit for a bit?

Each customer orders on certain days. For example, customer A ordered 3 on the first Sunday of the month and then ordered 1 on the last Saturday of the month.
 What I want to know is how can I automatically recognize the patterns (every sunday, every saturday, every 2 saturdays etc. ) considering that the data is very large (hard to determine manually). My desired output should be the list of possible patterns and the number of customers that fall in those patterns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies for the extremely vague title. I am a PhD student in theoretical physics. I am looking to get into quantitative research for which I need to be more agile with data science in Python.
 I did a course on python in my undergraduate and know the basics, might even be able to define some classes if I remind myself. 
 Say I start learning data science a few hours a day or so. How long time does it take to reach an acceptable level of data science to start a quantitative research/analyst role? 
 Again, vague question, but if anyone has been in a similar position I would love to hear your thoughts if I am a lost cause since I don't do any coding in my research (besides mathematica) or if I can catch up on the side the 1 year I have left of my PhD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a (relatively) new user here, so I’d like to hear from users who have been around for a while (or mods). There have been a few recent posts about (or on) social media, which were not removed, but were both flagged and upvoted by a significant number of users:
Are you still active in any social media platforms?
Stop writing Twitter threads
Three things to like about the Fediverse
For what it’s worth, I did enjoy reading both of these threads—but I also recognize that the culture of lobste.rs is formed primarily from users who have been around much longer than I have. If these posts are indeed off-topic, should they be removed? If they are on-topic, should a new tag (social-media) be added? Given that a large amount of users are flagging these stories, there is a strong case for wanting to filter them out. A disclaimer would probably need to be added (similar to merkle-trees), stating something along the lines of non-technical discussions on social media or general business news of social media is not allowed.
I double-checked the about page, and although many things are explicitly off-topic, social media is not mentioned:
entrepreneurship, management, news about companies that employ a lot of programmers, investing, world events, anthropology, self-help, personal productivity systems, last-resort customer service requests via public shaming, “I wanted to see what this site’s amazing users think about this off-topic thing”, and defining the single morally correct economic and political system for the entire world when we can’t even settle tabs vs. spaces.]]></summary>
