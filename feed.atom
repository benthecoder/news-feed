I am not disregarding this subreddit in any way, but since the conversation on AI has broadened, my reasoning is that we would need a much broader subreddit that also answers questions about these new models and also for users not particularly interested in the nitty gritty of AI jargon.
 I am particularly interested in conversations revolving around AI-powered search engines, given that Microsoft just launched Bing, and Google intends to try and catch up with Bard AI in a couple of weeks. I know there are a lot of people who also want to have these conversations and they also need a community, right?
 I am, in fact, thinking of creating one!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we have many different systems to develop a business application that meets our businesses. For example, many companies use salesforce, ms dynamics, sap and many other systems as ERP; at the same time today, we have systems like airtables, google appsheet - no-low-code platforms - generally abstract configurable databases with low-code features to write custom logic.
 What if we can develop some "AI specs translator" based on Chat GPT that would be able to parse specification and translate it into the final deployed system (specs into API requests for no code platform)? 
 Example (specs):
 User roles:
  
Administrator
 Warehouse manager
 Sales rep
  
Tables:
  
Product. Fields: id, name, description
 Warehouse: Fields: id, reference to product, count
 Order: id, reference to product, count, status
  
Views:
  
Order page: the page allows a sales rep to place an order for a product
 Kanban board page allows warehouse managers to complete created orders.
  
Do you think it would work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/datascience,
 Apologies if this question is out of place (or gets asked super frequently). But I would really love some insight here. 
 I (31 Male) am currently a carpenter - and while I do love it - I’m not positive that I want to spend the rest of my working life in it, for a multitude of reasons. Prior to becoming a carpenter, I graduated with a B.A. and worked in Marketing for about 2 years and then became a project manager at a bank. It was there that I was exposed to working with the data management dept on a few projects. While I am basically a total novice, it really interested me. I liked the “hands on” nature of it, and I liked the logical and structured approach to problems and solutions. I would also really love to work remote and be able to be more flexible/travel more.
 I’m now starting to consider a career change in the near-ish future, and wondering what my best route might be. I’m married but no kids, and could afford some education (~$20k or under ideally) to make the change if that’s required. Otherwise, I wouldn’t mind diving in myself to start learning and find employment on the ground level if that’s possible.
 Thanks for any insight into what I should consider about a career transition, as well as about the field as a whole.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I run a D&D game and there are many songs with lyrics that I want the instrumental version of to play during battles, in towns, etc. Most of them do not have an instrumental version that I can find. Does anyone know any good AI programs that remove vocals from songs? Free is preferable because I’m a broke college student but I am willing to pay if needed as I want a good end product.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi yall, I am working with Python and wanted to learn some insights from everyone.
 This is a large dataset that I am working on and I have thought of the following approaches :
 1. preprocess the images into smaller chunks/files
  
run multiprocessing to make it fast
 
store with BigQuery
 
train and test with smaller chunks of data to check the accuracy
 
 However, as I was reading through some StackOverflow resolutions, question that came out was:
  
Since this is for millions of data, would something like "set" instead of "list" improve the time ?
 
Would writing the data files using C++ make it faster?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN, wanted to share a project that I’ve been working on recently.
PodText allows users to find anything said on a podcast. You can also listen and share clips to a specific part of the podcast audio, simply by highlighting the text of that part. Currently there are just over 25k podcast episodes and I’m adding a lot more in the coming weeks (yes my GPU bill is painful).
In order to monetize it, I’m building a sponsorship database to help sponsors find podcasts and vice versa. This will be sold in the form of a $99/month “PodText Business” subscription. I bet I could charge a lot more to large sponsors but I’ll tweak that as I talk to potential customers.
Right now the UI is very bare bones (doesn’t even have pagination) but I’ll polish it once the data pipeline is working well. Please let me know if you run into any bugs or have any questions about the site or business model.
PS: I'm a regular on HN using my real name but can't post under that account since my employer will fire me if they found out about this project :-)

 I and some friends are mostly done building a platform that gives users API access to fine-tuned GPT models. This is something we wanted to see in the world and decided to build ourselves. 
 We're now looking for individuals with high-quality, fine-tuned GPT models that they would like to see on our platform. This is a great opportunity for those who have spent time and effort fine-tuning models to showcase their work to a wider audience, receive recognition, and monetize their work.
 If you have a fine-tuned GPT model that you would like to share on our platform, please reach out to us. We are always looking for new models to add to our platform, and we are eager to hear from you. Whether you have created a model that is specific to a particular domain or industry, or you have developed a model that is particularly advanced and highly specialized, we would love to hear from you.
 So, if you have a great fine-tuned GPT model, or you know someone who does, send me a message. We look forward to hearing from you soon!
 Thanks,

 I was wondering if there's a free or premium story-telling AI model that I could feed data to, for example, passages from a particular author or pages from their book, and then ask the AI to create a story using that author's writing style, dictionary, or ideas. 
 A while ago I watched a Youtube video, in which a person taught an AI to write screenplays in the style of a certain author and I'd like to do the same, except with short stories. Is it possible to do so without any coding knowledge? 
 Thanks.

I want to make the interview as fair as possible. So no super nasty or hard questions. What are good questions in relation to business intelligence, databases, statistics and data science?
 These are some questions I have written down:
 -What is the difference between sql and nosql? What advantages does a nosql database offer? Are there any disadvantages?
 -Why do you do so-called normalizations in connection with databases?
 -Which libraries have you already worked with in python?
 -In connection with statistics, the p-value can often be read. what does the p-value say and what is it used for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I interviewed at this workplace for a Data Scientist role , I am a junior with no experience besides an intership I did. The market is my country is brutal and Im struggling to find a job for 3 months already.
 I did however find a workplace which is mostly low tech hardware type of company but they have a data science & algorithms division. However kn the CEO interview he directly told me they are a conservative workplace - almost everyone are in their 50s and 60s, been there for 20-30 years already, they work on site only and they want someone to stay with them for several years because they do not want to waste time on people "from my generation" (in their words) who would leave after a year. Salary is also not high but for a junior I didnt expect much.
 It did stress me a bit because I dont think I will be a fit for their culture. + its a 1 hour drive each direction so it will be hard, and I dont want to waste time and not enjoy there and being not motivated to come to work. However Im financially stressed and I do need the money and its being hell to find jobs for juniors here.
 Wanted to ask you guys if you think I should go for it and do leave after half a year or a year until the market recovers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I 22m recently finished my bachelor's last year and have decided to apply for a masters in Data Science abroad which will take some time to prepare, which brings me to my dilemma. Some backstory: During the pandemic (apologies if I brought unpleasant memories) I started my self taught journey in data science, which involved watching a lot of tutorials, reading articles which somewhat gave me the jist of what algorithms and fundamentals (statistics, python,sql) are in the line of work. I watched some courses on statistics to try actually understand some concept like probability and especially harmonic mean lol, learnt SQL but never got to know how I'd use SQL to actually get data from a database anf use it for modeling. 2 years later, I honestly don't even know what am doing anymore, I wake up, log in to kaggle, find an interesting dataset, formulate a problem that might need solving (no matter how ridiculous it is) and do some analysis or build a model, and by the end of the day I contemplate whether what am doing is enough to actually land a job in the coming years. Don't get me wrong but I actually am very interested in the field.
 With a all the blogs and multiple YouTubers around providing information on what data science is all about I end up questioning the very name of the field, what the actual **** is data science? Feels like I have been doing nothing in the past few years (jus 2 lol) I have made some models with which I am proud of especially a food recommendation system that I ended up presenting as my finals project..in addition, I read a lot of threads in the sub of what employers are looking for during interviews and realize that there's so so much I still don't fully understand....
 Apologies for the rant, but today is jus one of those days that I question my efforts in the field.. Id really like to get some advice on how to continue on..

My question is, if you can train an AI on any data you want to get an output, could you in theory train an AI with source and compiled code with the intention of getting the AI to spit out an approximation source code for a compiled program? Its an interesting concept to toy with, but I'm not sure if it's viable. Let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I am new to ML and was wondering which encoding I should use.
 ​
 First, my mission:
 Predict flight coefficient based on historical data.
 My data:
 Int: year, month, day, week_day (of the flight)
 string: classname (like UberX or Uber_Select), departure_country, departure_city, departure_airport, arrival_airport, arrival_city, arrival_country
 ​
 target - coefficient: float
 ​
 So a lot of categorical data.
 I attempted pandas get_dummy and OneHotEncoding, which create those really large sparse matrixes. I read an article suggesting TargetEncoding, but that would make it harder for my model to find inter-relationships among this data (and I am sure there are)
 ​
 So if anyone can help me out choosing the right method, I would appreciate it greatly!
 I work with python, just in case

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all
 I'm sampling around 2% of the dataset to build a classification model using XGBOOST.
 I notice that when I re-run the whole pipeline I get quiet different results, something that could be explained by the sampling process. That's an issue when I compare to different models and the differences are small (i.e., not sure if they due to chance or not).
 How do you normally deal with that? Is there a way to build a 95% CI around the PR curve?

 Q: What's the best and most sane way to do this?
 Left to my own devices, I'd probably just upload the data to a Github repository. Any updates to the data can be git tracked.
 But, I'm also aware that there are dedicated platforms to catalog and share data (e.g. https://www.dolthub.com/, https://data.world/), and that uploading data on Github, in general, doesn't seem best practise.

 I have about 3.5 years experience leading teams, 6.5 years total. I joined this company a little over a year ago as an IC for the pay bump and was asked to lead the team after a couple of months.
 The model I inherited made < $1mm annually, and now it's on track for $2.5 - $3 mm since I took over. All stakeholders are happy, and I'm well liked within DS according to my boss and his boss. 10k feels like a very small difference, not a large enough difference for the promo or the scope of responsibility. Thoughts?
