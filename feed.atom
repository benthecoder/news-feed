        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks,
 I am an absolute novice in data science. I came up with this first example "distplot" in the seaborn module. The list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] which I provided to distplot, I just don't understand the output it gets me on both X-Axis and Y-Axis.
 The X-Axis gets me the values like -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 which I have no idea what it demonstrates.
 The example with the output link below shows you both the X and Y-Axis graphical demonstration.
 Example
 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns sns.distplot([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) plt.show() 
 Output: W3Schools Tryit Editor

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aside from basic descriptive statistics, e.g. mean, median, variance, etc. and basic graphical methods, scatter plot, histogram, time series plot, etc. Surely you calculate means and variances and make various visualizations quite often, yes?
 How often do you use a t-test to compare means? ANOVA (simple or more advanced versions)? Goodness of fit (of some variety)? Linear regression? Multivariate linear regression? Perform an analysis of model fit using some information criterion? Other advanced statistical methods?
 The purpose of the question is to decide on what is the ideal list of (advanced) statistics topics a data scientist should know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR - Boss wants evidence, outside a portfolio of work, that I am knowledgeable enough for a DS title/pay change. Looking for suggestions.
 ​
 I'm currently a senior level analyst, and perform a decent amount of "Datascience" work already. I am 100% self-taught though, so my portfolio and resume don't exactly line up.
 Recently my boss and I discussed a title/pay change from Sr Analyst to Datascientist [or something akin to that], and he wanted a quick "proof of knowledge" that he could show to upper-management/HR for approval.
 The way he talked about it, it sounded like he was looking for a certificate (company paid for) or some other program that provides a "proof of knowledge". I'd like to do this the honest/"right" way, so ideally I'm looking for something that's not just handed out to anyone with a little Tableau/SQL experience.
 ​
 Any suggestions? Since the company is paying for it, I'd be game to hear suggestions for moderate/advanced courses that are helpful too!
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I'm currently in quite the Dilemma regarding data science/analytics internships. For reference I am currently a rising junior attending a large state university Studying Economics with minors in Statistics and Mathematics. I've been fortunate enough to intern in an Analytics/Modeling role at a large fortune 50 insurance company and also have DevOps experience at a lab.
 Recently though I've been applying to summer 2023 internships and was able to get multiple offers at several large companies. I've narrowed down my offers to two different companies which I will briefly describe.
 Company 1: Large Fortune 500 Banking/Credit firm, located on the east coast, with a high 'prestige' name. Pure Data Analytics Internship (Dashboards, Reporting, SQL, Automation, ETL, etc).
 Company 2: Medium Sized Car Automotive group, located near my current university, offering a pure Data Science Internship (Focus in pricing, loans and credit modeling)
 Ideally I would love to work in Fintech moving forward which is one of the main reasons Company 1 stands out. However moving to Company 1 would be a pain regarding location as I would have to travel across the nation.
 Additionally the experience I could gain at Company 2 seems great, there business model relies heavily on the data science team to develop production level models. Further I've met the team I would be working with and could tell I could learn a ton from them.
 I am aware that the prestige I could gain from Company 1 would be immense, however I am weary to chose the role just because I'm worried it will only lead to more data analyst internships down the line (which I would ideally like to avoid).
 Further, I'm very passionate about ML/econometrics/statistics and although I understand and appreciate the power of pure analytics, I'm worried I could see myself getting bored in a strictly analytics based role.
 I would really appreciate any input or thoughts!

 I am an Irish Data Scientist sitting in Kranidi with my fiancée and soon to be mother and father in law. There are many cats here - and I am a cat lover and father of two lovely domestic short hairs. I tried to pet this lovely cat but she was too skittish, but I did snap this picture. My soon to be father-in-law (STBFIL) is a brilliant interventional cardiologist and he believes this is a Ghost Cat. 
 I slightly believe this but my education calls me to reason that this image is using multiple pictures and the phone is programmed to use a summation function over the pixels between images to sum the vectors and make it appear that the cat is transparent. I promise that the cat is not behind the glass! I know this from seeing the cat before taking the picture and remembering the event well. What do you think? Does anyone have an explanation for me and my STBFIL?

 What else should I be doing during this time?
 Once in college, what should I be doing to have the best possible position and opportunity after graduating?
 Specific Clubs? Specific Skills? Specific Networks? 
 Lastly, what do you consider to be the hardest skills to "learn" or "teach" that someone should possess before considering this field
 Do you think Data Science requires a specific "type" of person? Or do you think anyone could do what you do with enough time and practice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, so I am very confused on the meaning of some terms in the data space as some of them seem to be synonyms, some of them seem to be slight variations. Can you help me clear up my confusion? Bonus points if you give a source in your explanation that holds up in an academic setting.
 I already looked up the meaning in some textbook but was not able to form a coherent picture encompassing all terms
 The terms:
 Data Science
 Data Analysis
 Data Analytics
 Data Mining
 Machine Learning
 Business Intelligence
 Business Analytics
 Statistics
 Analytics
 Advanced Analytics
