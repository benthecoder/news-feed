        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At work, we rely on Excel macros and Python automated task scheduler reports. I code in Python and have been for 2.5 years professionally. We do a lot of reporting / email alerts based on events on some data. I have never built a web app but I know SQL, and Python at a professional level. I need some wisdom from you people! How can I make a web application that:
  
Will display data like we do in powerbi (preferably interactive, not necessary at first if extra infrastructure is needed). Charts, tables etc
 
Run on a cloud database
 
Users will log in via 2 step authentication
 
Generate reports based on the data, these are reports we generate daily using local files, using a batch file, written in Python. Automatically on a schedule
 
Store the reports we generate as pdfs and help the user download a report any time they want
 
 What are some of your favorite structures for backend in python, cloud database, and front end web app part for a beginner?
 Thank you everyone for sharing your wisdom!

 1) So I can back up what I'm stating in my resume
 2) Have something to present in an interview 
 Are there any complications with this since it's not real company data and it's not the actual project I worked on during company time?

 My question is for those of you who work in machine learning; what are the most common languages and platform/notebooks etc used to develop and express your functions that you see on a day to day basis? What would be your expectations for someone moving into that realm of data science coming from analytics?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I am a fairly new working professional in Software Engineering, who was recently laid off. I am currently in the final interview stages of 2 companies for 2 different roles - data scientist and data engineer. The thing is - I have some experience working within both the domains, and also have a couple of publications in NLP. 
 While I completely understand that the final decision is going to be upto me, I had a few questions for people here - especially for the people who have made a switch from data engineering to data science. 
  
How easy was it for you to switch?
 Why did you make the switch?
 What is something that you really love and really hate about the 2 domains?
  
This would help me gain better insight and make an even more informed decision.
 Thanks!

 I'm a junior who is struggling to find a job in the currect market and after I had a chat with a startup CEO I casually met he highly recommended me to start networking via conferences as my chances to land a job are much higher than traditionally submitting resumes.
 I do understand his point I just feel like as a junior maybe I should distribute my energy towards improving certain demanded techincal skills and projects rather than engaging with managers who might probably not be that interested to a junior? Plus I never really heard of people that landed a job from networking.
 Has anyone ever landed a job by networking?

The program is bootcamp style, I have assignments linked to the topics taught. I have to use the knowledge gained from the topics and apply them to projects at work. I hope to transition to a DS role by the end of the year if I'm lucky internally. I have a $1000 education budget we can use for books subscriptions etc through my employer.
 Any recommendations for subscriptions I should buy to supplement my learning? I was thinking of getting leetcode sub to start grinding sql and python problems from around Q2. Is datacamp any good?

I'm not the most experienced Data Scientist out there but I would consider myself a little more experienced than your average new grad having done a lot of analysis, modeling, and data engineering work with some very experienced data scientists across different subject areas. 
 As I was interviewing I decided that I wanted to stick in a specific space in sustainability so I found a local company (150 employees) that does very software-heavy consulting in the space for a lot of F50 companies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a backend developer and nowdays I'm working on a project where I have incoming stream of images and I have to run object-detection task on them.
 We chose as the company to use an external object-detection api provider rather than creating our own models.
 Therefore I searched for different object-detection API out there and decided to use AWS Rekognition.
 Seems like their API is not very easy to use and require many post-processing functions on the response that contains the bounding boxes. Other API's I have checked require post/pre-processing on the images/response labels as well.
 ​
 I'm wondering if its just me or consuming AI API's is very unstructured, complexed and has lots of overhead.
 I would be happy to hear how you dealt with such cases when you had to consume a Computer Vision/ NLP API's.
  
Was it hard and required additional logic around the pre/post processing of the input/output ?
 Do you have any tools/tricks to make this API integrations easier ?
  
Thanks !

 It monitors social media steams and captures (counts) when stock tickers are independently mentioned. It then sticks that data into a CSV in the following format
 stock | times mentioned | date mentioned APL 20 11/11/2023 MSFT 14 11/11/2023 APL 22 11/12/2023 
 It does this each 24 hr period and does two things
  
Saves the 24hr period captures into a daily CSV with a datestamp filename
 Appends the data the grand 'master' CSV.
  
I then bring this data together and do some additional cleanse, transforms and such to help do time series analysis over the date range for each stock.
 After transformation of indexes and columns my final working CSV is 209 rows x 9450 columns but naturally is set to grow and grow.
 I'm wondering whether I should now be looking at migrating to MySQL/SQLlite or is continuing to use CSV perfectly appropriate??
 This is my first real project since learning Python and I'm both heavily invested and committed in progressing my learning and exploration on data and data-science areas of Python but am quite naive about such data storage / pipeline topics and which to implement when.
 Would welcome your thoughts and advice.
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We are working on a UE AI project for a SP FPS game. The core concept of the game is around fighting the AI in a realistic, but fun way. It will have a deep perception system and a fairly large combat and non combat behavior tree.
 We have made some good progress with the combat AI when it is outdoors. It is far from finetuned, but it works, and it is actually fun and challenging. The next step to tackle is indoors. Close combat simulation, searching for target, etc. I really would like it to be dynamic and not tied to hard coded environmental triggers but the small team of mine is pushing for that. Clearly that is the easier approach and I could not come up with some good ideas so here I am to ask the community.
 So my question is: Any existing dynamic AI implementation out there for recognizing a corner, a door, objects the enemy can hide behind without actually designating map elements as such? Any info would be appreciated!
 Thank you!

I come from a middle-class family and my father runs a successful computer and accessories business, but I have my own aspirations to make a big impact. I have a BSc in Computer Science and have even tried to start my own software company, but unfortunately, it failed. This setback has left me feeling sad and discouraged, but I am determined not to give up on my goals.
 I am now considering pursuing an MSc in Data Science abroad, with the hope that it will increase my chances of success. I am torn, however, as I also want to support and expand my father's business. I am from an underdeveloped country, and I am unsure of the best path to take. Can anyone offer me guidance and advice on how to balance my education, business aspirations, and familial responsibilities? I am eager to hear from those who have faced similar challenges and overcome them."

 But I feel like seeing all these giant tech companies laying off thousands of works, it’s probably flooded the market with tech workers looking for a job. And this is only highly publicized companies. I’m sure smaller companies have done that too but just haven’t been reported on.
 Plus with ChatGPT out, I’m thinking firms are even more so reconsidering things.
 I ask because I’m trying to finish data quest’s data scientist path and I’m like am I even going to have a chance to get a decent paying job when I finish. 
 I’m going to be competing with veteran data science individuals with PhD in CS or Stats or Math with 10-15 years of experience or top university graduates from Harvard, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon because they got laid off recently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are a company with two platforms, platform a & platform b.
 Assume we have a 2D matrix, where each record represents a client, the client has three sets of features:
  
feature set a: captures the behavior of the clients on platform a including their purchases on platform a of different products.
 features set b: captures the behavior of the clients on platform b including their purchases on platform b of different products.
 features set c: captures additional features gathered by a survey.
 The location of each client.
  
The matrix is sparse, meaning:
 - Most of the clients don't have all the feature sets available, i.e. if a client has entries for feature set a, it's most likely that they don't have entries for feature set b and features set c and vice versa.
 - Some clients have empty feature set a and feature set b (they are not using our platform)
 - Most of the clients purchase a small subset of the of the products.
 The goal is to predict the total monthly purchases per product per location. It's simply the sum of purchases on platform a and purchases done on platform b. But again most clients purchases are unknown on one of the platforms. and a small subset of clients don't have purchases on either.
 Example:
 a sample of the matrix
 I am thinking matrix factorization, what do you think, is it suitable for such use case? or do you have other more appropriate approaches in mind?

 Would the sampling depend on gender? If yes, would it consider other genders as well. Will demographic play part? Like half of all population each country?
 Let's discuss this?

 After studying and working really hard I landed my first job as a Junior BI developer last October, hobing that I can get someday in the future from data analysis to machine learning engineering.
 However, my current company isn’t helping me learn or add to my skills, there’s no BI team and no one with experience to guide me. I even feel like my technical skills were better before I joined here. 
 I am doing my best to work and learn and I apply to various positions but most require more experience than what I have. 
 I had a technical interview today and the interviewer told me that they need a BI developer with 4+ years of experience, and he offered to get me a technical interview as a Power BI developer instead. 
 I don’t feel good about it as I enjoy the whole BI process especially integration and Analysis. 
 I feel lost and can’t figure out what to do. I am not sure whether I an heading where I want to…
 Your advice is appreciated.

 I want to become a successful DS but I don't consider myself a subject matter expert in any field. I have almost 5 years of experience as a BI / Data Analyst and wanted to make the leap to become a DS so I took a Master's and the first thing I noticed is that all of my peers have a strong background in very specific áreas (Medicine, Agronomy, Economics). So my question is, did you choose a subject before becoming a data scientist? Just Share your thoughts :) Sorry for the bad spelling beforehand lol

But my chances are pretty low/ nil as it's pretty late after the cycle is almost over. So I've included some lower ranked Unis for DS in my shortlist (Stevens institute of technology being my fail-safe) 
 But acceptance rates for MS Business Analytics programs at most UCs and other Top Unis are surprisingly VERY high. And people with much more mediocre profiles than mine get in easily.

 This could be total user error, and it likely is, but does anybody have any recommendations?
 Are there any legitimate AI consultancy groups out there?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there! I'm making a personal project centered around hourly load forecasting, and am at crossroads where I realize that some advice is needed on a few questions:
  
What data should I collect that would be helpful? I can get hourly forecasted and historical weather data from the PirateWeather API, but how would I integrate these into my model? It seems straightforward to use historical data, but difficult for forecasted data because I can request hourly forecasts of a specific time in the future for each hourly time interval between the present and then, repeated over and over until the future time coincides with now. For example, if I collect hourly forecasts 10 days in advance, then I will have (10*24)+(9*24+23)+(9*24+22)+...+1=28920 different forecasts for each timestamp. How would I even go about organizing that in a table?
 What kinds of models are useful for time series forecasting with multiple variables? Furthermore, how should I transform my features to be used by different kinds of models?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there! New(ish) data scientist here!
 So I'm going to transition soon to more data scientist roles (mine typically uses only Excel and I have to go out of my way to find applications to program) and I'm trying to beef up my Github/Resume/etc.
 Back when I was in my MS program, I'd have a whole bunch of programs each year but they were very small in scope (stroke prediction, product reviews, etc.) and so I'm working on this program which I'm having a lot of fun with (medical diagnostic) but the thing is that it's larger in scope than any project I've worked on before.
 Do I have to worry about optics? Is a potential employer going to look through my resume and ask, "You used to have four-five projects a year and now you only have one, what gives?"
 I appreciate your help. Thanks!
 ​
 Also, side question: At what point can I put a project on my resume? A project like this can always be fine-tuned and improved, but I think it's unreasonable to say I can never put it on my resume until it's absolutely perfect (which I find to be a nearly impossible standard in some cases, such as this).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to work on a term project for my advanced database management class. We predominately work with RDBMs in class, so ideally I’d explore something else for my project to help expand my repertoire - the only thing is with so much information out there, I don’t know what really considered relevant/in demand nowadays. 
 Currently I’m thinking of doing a project using NoSQL (MongoDB) while also practicing some ETL and working with other big data platforms. 
 The professor has also suggested creating a data warehouse - that’s more in the realm of RDBMs though and I would like to get some more experience with big, unstructured data.
 I guess my question is, if you were recruiting someone as a data engineer or analyst, what would impress you the most? I want to crest something that will grab the attention of employers.
 I’m open to all kinds of suggestions - I was told I could also compare and contrast the ETL process using mongodb vs apache spark (using various unstructured/semi-structures data) 
 Would appreciate some guidance on this, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So ever since becoming a data scientist, I've been constantly getting flooded with connect requests on Linkedin. I'd say about half of them are established people in the field, (DS/DA/DE), and the other half are people trying to get into the field. Additionally, I get about 4-6 new requests every week from people asking to connect with me, either asking for a job referral, to talk about my role, or advice on how to break into data science. So I usually meet about 2-4 of people a week to give them advice how to get into the field since a lot of people I've talked to think my career pivot is inspiring. I had close to 100 LinkedIn connections this time last year and now I'm over 600 and climbing.
 ​
 I wanted to ask is getting this many requests normal for other data scientists (roughly 6-12 per week)? And if so, how do you guys deal with all the other people asking for help all the time (if you choose too, since I've realized it can become time-consuming)? My manager says he gets requests for help all the time too and it's because of the field we are in, so I was curious if most other data scientists experience this? I've talked to other successful people with great jobs, and although they did get a lot of requests for help, especially earlier on in their careers, some did mention that the amount I get weekly is pretty high. I also wonder if it just happens to be due to the job market as of late?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chat gpt is big right now and AI has been an increasingly mainstream topic, but I'd like to think about the difference between the current 'AI' and a true 'artificial intelligence'.
 When I think of a true artificial intelligence, I think of an entity that has its own will and desires. An entity that can produce its own internal thought process and maintain a stream of consciousness. This does not currently occur with chat gpt and similar programs and it's not their goal.
 Chat gpt (from what I understand) runs off a training inventory, an algorithm to decipher that inventory and produce acceptable outputs based on input given. It can use language, but that language is nothing more than statistics. 'What, given the available resources, is the logical output.' It's a series of if-then statements.
 I've used writing AI programs, and have created dialogues, but I know that none of them will ever have true independence thought, as it's not in their programming. They are reactive, not proactive programs.
 What are your thoughts on these different types of AI? Do you know of any programs working towards a simulated consciousness?
