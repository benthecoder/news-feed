        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I’m the cofounder of a tech startup focused on providing free AI services. 
 We’ve developed a pretty cool app that offers AI services like image generation, code generation, image captioning, and more for free. 
 We’re sort of like a Swiss Army knife of generative and analytical AI.
 We’ve released a new feature called AAIA(Ask AI Anything), which is capable of answering all types of questions, even requests to generate literature (fantasy, folklore, drama, fiction, fable, etc). It’s sort of like chat-gpt.
 We’d appreciate it if you could try it out and let us know your thoughts: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bright-eye/id1593932475

 The source code being all in C++, formal installation with CMake, language binding for Python with easy installation using pip, a binding for R, and some decent documentation and samples to get running, this led me to start using the project for some Machine Learning work in my research lab.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a freshman at college and I currently do not have a major. I am thinking about what I want to do and one of those possibilities is data analytics. 
 I really enjoy learning and analyzing data and statistics. I also like figuring out why trends emerge.
 However I am not experienced in this field at all. The only class even remotely related to this was my high school statistics class that was so easy a kindergartener could do it. I am also not very good at algebra and I have never tried calculus yet (pre calculus was hard for me (especially because it was during the pandemic)). Another issue is that I can’t code. I have heard that coding can be very important to the field and so that’s another worry. 
 The final thing to note is that I am not very interested in business. If I went into data analytics I would not want to do business analytics. Rather I would like to do research analytics. Is this a stable field or no?
 Thanks for the help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like audio AI is lagging behind visual AIs that seem to be all the rage now, in the past years, super resolution for photo and video, frame interpolation with DAIN and diffusers like dalle and derivates have changed the paradigm.
 Right now the focus seems to be TTS and STT, with whisper or the newly anunced vall-e from microsoft, which I haven't found to be there yet.
 I would like to have some free natural TTS or voice to voice, disorting your own voice, not necesarilly coping another one. 
 Here's some other cool one's I've found:
 - Dalle-like music creator https://huggingface.co/spaces/fffiloni/spectrogram-to-music
 - Voice restoration https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/VoiceFixer
 - Voice separation https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/google-develops-ai-that-can-separate-voices-in-a-crowd/
 The voice restoration could be used next to the voice separation one, for example
 Other interesting things I would like to have are very singing focused, and not for everyone, but what about:
 - More accurate pitch detection https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXEB8YgzcvY
 - Singing quality ranking https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cIgG-wkW4
 - Audio restoration (here some people complained about it) https://www.reddit.com/r/sounddesign/comments/utmfkf/ai_tool_to_repair_lossy_sound/
 Audio restoration could be used from upping the quality of a 2008 concert, to clipping removal, to reverb supression. 
 My question is if there are researchers interested on these things, can we make good datasets? Can we define these things?

ERM is using least squares to find a best fit line to some data points. MLE is the same process just using the normal distribution to account for noisy output. I'm still working affine functions so in my case it's predicting slope and intercept. Am I in the right ballpark here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all—
 I've been looking around here, google, and stackoverflow but I haven't found a consensus on the best tool to script the production of formatted / colored Excel outputs from data in R or Python. I would love to hear what people here think. 
 To give you my specific example: what I'm trying to do is go from a dataframe or series of dataframes (in R, or python) to an end product in Excel for nontechnical users. The .xlsx will have different tabs with different slices of data in the tables - change over time, different demographic views, and so on. 
 There is no alternative to a .xlsx output (i.e. Tableau or some other tool). 
 The final formatted output should include at least the following characteristics: different colors for different column headers, filters at the top of tables, multiple tabs, conditional formatting. 
 If any of you have done something like this before I'd love to hear your take on the best tool / packages / workflow to get this done. Grazie!

 Are AI focused studies even a thing in the rest of the world (outside of what seems to be Harvard and other top universities)?
 If I want to study AI where should I start/go, uni or college or somewhere else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Everyone,
 I am interested to know what mathematical areas you struggle with in data science.
 I'll be happy to answer questions you have that is related to either programming or mathematics in data science.
 The reason I want to do this here is this.
 I have a platform where I teach mathematics for professionals and students who either (a) wish to have more in-depth mathematical training or (b) have no advance mathematical background at all (psychology, economics, etc.).
 I'm designing a course on Mathematics for Data Science but wish to tailor it based on what people actually want to learn.
 Your questions will help me have some idea about what I could cover in such a course and, hopefully, I'd be able to provide you with useful answers in return.
 Again, if you have questions related to mathematics or programming, just post here and I'll answer your questions as best as I can.

 been using nightcafe but it fails to deliver what I ask for, all I want is purple or pink-skinned woman in a green drrss and it gives while women with any hair color it wants, I ask for a priest with a celtic cross on the chest, am lucky if I get a cross on the background.
 I have tried others, barely got close with the priest, but the technicolored woman I want, no matter the prompt or even use of a start image, is wildly off the mark
 any AI that can deliver art of a brightly colored humanoid or a simple symbol on the chest?
 or any prompt suggestion that I can apply?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently formed a small data science team working on big data projects related to e-commerce. Now, I, as the supervisor, am thinking about how to maintain productive teamwork among us. Regarding toolsets, we have options like google cloud, AWS, GitLab, Trello, Slack, and Jira, where required. 
 I have the following specific concerns:
  
How can we collaborate on the same piece of code? For example, I want to check the code DS1 has written and modify or comment on it and also use it myself where needed. Is it better to use GitLab, Jupiter notebooks, google colab, or AWS sagemker?
 How can one DS quickly share the result of his/her EDA analysis with others instead of exporting the figure as an image and sending it to the slack channel? Should we use Jupiter/google notebooks, google Sheets/data studio/AWS quicksight, python code on GitLab, or any better idea?
 Our data is stored in our on-premises local servers as CSV files. For prototyping phases, I batch download a specific period of it to my local drive as raw data. Then I run my ETL pipeline on the local version each time I want to try an EDA analysis or an ML algorithm. How can we change this pipeline to be convenient for teamwork? Does each DS need its own personalized ETL pipeline? or is it better to create an archive of ETL codes that each DS can call based on the need? Should we store the results of specific ETLs on the Cloud to be more accessible to others and also prevent having different results by each DSs? 
 Any other tools to improve the productivity of a data science team?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all!
 I'm currently working on my MS in Data Science and I'm having a hard time deciding which courses would be most valuable for my career.
 In my program, there are two paths you can choose: Business Analytics or DS/ML. Mind you, you don't have to commit to one or the other, but it will show up on your diploma if you complete the course requirements for either path.
 Every course in the program appears to be extremely valuable, but unfortunately I can't take them all. I was leaning towards doing the DS/ML path, but there are courses in the BA path that DO NOT intersect with the DS/ML path. 
 My question is - which course would give me more value overall? 
 Here's an example of a course tradeoff:
  
 Data Science in Business - Taught in R, focuses on identifying, formulating and solving business problems
  
OR 
  
Applied Machine Learning - Taught in Python, focuses on neural networks and deep learning, including an emphasis on model selection and tuning 
  
I know Applied ML sounds much more rigorous and "cool", but in terms of how much I'll be using that in the real world - would it provide more value than DS in Business in the real world?

Paulo and I have been indie gamers for the past decade. Both of us have insanely long back catalogs of games we’ve always wanted to try, but couldn’t. When we were stuck at home during covid, we were frustrated and decided to set out to solve this problem. Naturally, this decision was made during a game of Call of Duty: Warzone.
For consumers, MagnaPlay eliminates the paywall when it comes to buying a new game. Today, the indie market is incredibly saturated and prices are increasing. A subscription service, like Spotify, can make indie gaming more affordable and allow players to try out more content.

Even though my major was electronics, I always leaned more towards CS (approx 70% of my subjects were coding and software dev related). In 2022, I started school again to complete my masters in data science. I am now applying for internships in data science and facing rejections again and again. I’m not understanding what I’m lacking. I have a 3.7 GPA, I have 2 research paper publications and I have done several projects as well (3 listed on my resume). I’m confident my resume is ATS friendly (I checked) but I don’t even get considered for assessments much less interviews. Could someone working in the field please help me by telling me what I’m doing wrong? I did my undergrad in India and am currently studying in the USA (I’m authorised to work under CPT/OPT).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNET reporter Jackson Ryan published an article last month describing how ChatGPT, an AI that can generate human-sounding text, would affect journalists and the news industry. Since then, the very publication that ran Ryan’s article has been quietly publishing articles written by AI since November.

 The outlet says they will continue to publish each article with “editorial integrity” and says, “Accuracy, independence, and authority remain key principles of our editorial guidelines.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all,
 I've been building a codon optimizer (translating amino acids to DNA codons) using the transformer model 'Attention is all you need'. I've been training it on 1,5 million tokens. As the image shows the loss is stuck and very stable at 1.05, even after 4000 epochs (see figure A). When I use the model for interference I see that it does a lot right, how ever it seems not possible for it to find the <EOS> token. Figure B shows my inference with the bold tokens showing the desired length. It goes all the way untill it reaches the max_len constraint. The average length of the translated sequence is 300 tokens and a maximum of 1000 tokens. My questions: How can I stimulate the model to find the <EOS>? Since the length of the source is always the same length as the target can I hard code the EOS, would this help? Do I have enough tokens to train on or should i get more? If you need more information I can provide it :)
 Thank you for helping me out,
 Greetings from the Netherlands,
 Daan

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I've run across one really great piece of news. I would love to discuss it with you.
 The fact that neural network technology is accelerating, as hardware that mimics neuron-connecting tissue copies brain functions such as learning and decision-making, memristive devices which mimic neuron synapses could be the next big leap for AI.
 The definition in this article would be: "Memristors, or memory resistors, are switches that remember which electric state they were in prior to being turned off."
 So, today scientists aim to use memristors to build electronic neurons which can both compute and store data. These devices could also greatly increase energy efficiency over conventional microchips, which inefficiently transport data back and forth between processors and memory in traditional computers.
 "Brain-inspired neural hardware could also find usage in analyzing medical data sets and scans or empower autonomous vehicles beyond their current capabilities."
 Isn't that awesome? It's like Sci-Fi, right?
 Still, current devices rely on emerging tech, which are somewhat unreliable. To overcome these challenges, Israeli and Chinese researchers created memristive devices also known as silicon synapses.
 All of this sound pretty confusing but it's all well explained in the article above.
 Let me know what you think.
