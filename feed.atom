        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Similar to a post I've recently seen in this sub. The difference is that the person that posted it was also doing a masters in Data Science.
 For someone that is not doing a masters in stats/ds would it be worth it to get some certifications on DS topics they didn't study in uni? In my case im doing a masters in ECE and taking a lot of ML courses but lacking in stats courses. Would it be worth it to take courses in time series, GLMs, causality, etc... to work in data science?

I’m not particularly great at presenting and so mistakes will inevitably happen during a screen recording, and it’s worse when you’re already 5 minutes into your recording, forcing you to restart completely.
Please check this out and let us know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings my dudes. I've been looking for a job as a data scientist / engineer in the UK for a few months now. Graduated recently with a BSc in Physics & Astronomy from a top university, got a LinkedIn, a Github with some of my academic projects online, a decent array of skills: Python, SQL, and the standard DS libraries + some ML, web scraping and framework stuff. Completed an internship at a fintech startup last summer and gained some backend / data engineering experience.
 The problem is, I can't even land an interview. Like, I don't mean I get a few, I mean I haven't got A SINGLE ONE. Not seen a human face yet. What gives? Is this a reflection of the job market as a whole at the moment, or am I just considered a weak candidate because I don't have a Masters or a CS background? Anyone else having a similar experience right now and got some constructive tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. 
 I'm MLE (Machine Learning Engineer) and I'm currently thinking to do ML freelancing jobs (or gigs) in the future. One idea I had is to just focus on studying recommendation systems ( that is, be a specialized data scientist) or try to study and solve every type of ML problems (time series, NLP, etc). 
 What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've created a GitHub Action for running commands on multiple platforms. This includes platforms that GitHub Actions don't natively support. It currently supports FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD. OpenBSD can run on x86-64 and ARM64, the other operating systems run on x86-64.
Some of the features that are supported include:
* Multiple operating system with one single action
* Multiple versions of each operating system
* Allows to use default shell or Bash shell
* Low boot overhead
* Fast execution
* Runs on both macOS and Linux runners
Compared to similar solutions like https://github.com/vmactions/freebsd-vm, the boot time is around a fifth and the full execution time for the same job is around half of freebsd-vm (last time I tried).
The readme contains more information about how it all works under the hood.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m graduating with my Masters of Science degree in Data Science in November from Eastern University. I’d like to get experience under my best before graduating to hopefully springboard my career after graduation. I currently work in marketing, so what I do now has almost zero overlap. Question for you all- no right or wrong answers, would just love your thoughts. 
 I see myself having two options. 1. Get a data analyst position while still in school (i know all of the necessary tools and programs) 2. Get a data science internship while in school. 
 Which do you think would benefit me more? I don’t want to get stuck as an analyst if I have a masters in Data Science.
 For context, my ultimate goal is to ideally work in some sort of criminology/social justice data science position. There are internships and analyst positions in the field.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Reaching out to this community because I’m either stumped or too exhausted to think clearly at this point. Here’s some context:
 My organization has recently developed a dashboard to eliminate our monthly survey report. This report contains the results (essentially averages broken out by different groups) of our month over month employee engagement surveys. 
 We’ve been tasked with providing additional analyses using these data. The problem is that this is starting a brand new survey, so we can’t compare previous results. The dashboard captures most of what our clients are interested in. I’m struggling to find any additional analyses that might be useful. Just wondering if anyone has any ideas as to where we can go so our dashboard doesn’t take over. 
 Appreciate any and all suggestions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all!
 I have been experimenting with a few AI apps (I was lucky enough to get into the leonardo beta). I am mainly interested in creating character sheets for 3D modelling like this:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/7vv9zotsbfca1.jpg?width=564&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37df5fc0affb728338a3517d5710453b72b0830b
 Initially, I thought that training a model with a bunch of character sheets from google images would suffice. I figured if I used an image of a character (think general concept art, without the T-pose and different views) as the "input" image, it would spit out something resembling a character sheet, only with the character I want in it. This didn't work, it ended up re-imagining the character with the art style of the character sheet (hand drawn lines, cartoony):
 ​

 So I guess my question is: Is there an AI service/app/tool that might accomplish this? If not, what other methods should I look into?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN!
I’m excited to share sketch: a tool to help anyone who uses python and pandas quickly iterate and get to answers for their data questions.
Sketch installs as a pandas extension that offers utility functions that operate on natural language prompts. Using the `ask` interface you can get answers in natural language. Using the `howto` interface you can get get python and pandas code directly. The primary benefit of this over copilot and chatGPT is that this adds data-content based context so that the generated answers are much more accurate and relevant to the data problem at hand.
Check out the demo video[1] and try it out using the colab notebook (on github)!

 I was a business stats teaching prof for 10+ years, focused on Excel and Minitab and taught the basic and linear regression courses. I'd like to career shift into business analyst or data analyst role and I'm here to ask for suggestions on what tools I should learn going forward. What questions should I ask myself, what challenges should I pursue?
 My org uses Excel, Dataiku, Power BI. Obviously those, but if I want to move to another org, what do you suggest?
 I've taken some basic Python programming and while I'm know I wouldn't enjoy programming ALL DAY, I enjoy the puzzle solving nature of programming. 
 I have a strong business background in project management and an MBA in ops management FWIW. I like working with smart people who strive to learn more.
 Thanks all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all,
 I'm training a transformer for a specific task. The task is to translate an amino acid sequence into DNA codons. There are multiple DNA codons that code for a certain amino acid (see fig 1). This means that multiple answers are good. However, my loss function penalizes the model just as hard for a really wrong output (different amino acid) as a codon that is a wrong output but generates the same amino acid. My question is: How can I design my loss function that it penalizes the wrong output but the right amino acid less than a completely wrong output. I programmed my model in Pytorch. 
 Thanks and greetings from the Netherlands,
 Daan

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I’m designing an AB Test to find out certain treatment’s impact on customer purchase frequency. The problem is that to reach desired p-value/power, we need a lot more customer in the experiment than we could afford to. 
 Say if I ran the test for 90 days, the metric I’m testing is the number of orders for each customer over the 90 days. If I put 1000 customers in this experiment, that’s only 1000 observations (Customer X placed Y orders during the test period). The effect I’m trying to test is quite small and the STDEV of the order frequency is quite big. 
 Then I had this idea, if I change the observation frequency, instead of “Customer X placed Y orders during the entire 90 days”, an observation becomes “Customer X place Y orders on Day Z”. Basically this changes the test metrics from “Orders per 90 days” to “Orders per each day”. This would give me 1000*90 = 9000 observations with the same customers and test period. I ran the numbers this would give me statistically significant result much sooner or with much fewer customers. 
 My question is, is this a valid way of designing AB Test? It feels to me by observing a more granular metric, the test is made more sensitive to differences. But I’m not from very academic background and certainly not a statistician, any help is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my last position, I was an analyst but I never felt things came to me naturally. Whenever there were issues in PowerBI, I had a difficult time thinking of solutions or outside the box. Insight generation such as putting together a few sentences beyond "A went up by 10% MoM" was a struggle for me. I'm learning SQL online right now but am not motivated as I do not I find it fun. In short, my subpar performance almost led to my firing but I ended up leaving. Am I bad at analytics or just lazy?
 I am an a receptionist right now and I find that I am GREAT at this job. I'm not messing up and genuinely feel my people skills are put to good use. Perhaps I can move into an executive assistant role but I know I will not be satisfied with the career trajectory, salary or "face" (compared to data analytics).
 I'm struggling to make a decision on which career path to choose. I'd really like to be in the analytics space but find that I really suck and it does not seem very natural to me. Alternatively, I'm good at being an admin but know the salary will not satisfy me long-term.
