        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll be honest in the beginning of my research for possible grad universities, I was looking at any that would straight away offer MS Data Science or Data analytics. So I applied to MS Analytics for some universities. I was mostly worried that since I don't have a solid undergraduate background in computer science, I wouldn't get in. I am a math major. Eventually I've come to know of possible degrees like applied math/statistics or CS degrees that allow diverse backgrounds that would still teach me courses heavily involved in Data science. I recently got my first admit to a US university for MS Analytics. As an international applicant, I'm happy I was offered an admission but worried this program may not help me gain a technical background.
 Would love some advice?

 One of the lead members of my team is the assistant professor at the uni, "Steve". He has a PhD in the field, and it shows. He holds daily meetings during weekdays for anyone to join so they can get answers and his insights on things they've been working on. Everyone in the team always go to him for subject support.
 Recently, I've been attending the meeting a lot, and it feels like I'm asking stuff that I have genuinely no idea about, but basic knowledge for him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got into data science in college, but since I was almost done with my marketing degree I decided to get a job in marketing instead and get a stats minor. Now I'm getting back into it because my favorite classes in college were always applied statistics (econometrics/business analytics/applied regression). I took the ML Google Developer Crash Course a year ago, but feel like I lack the numpy/pandas/tensorflow foundation required for a standard data science job (I've been able to rely on SPSS for a few years now)
 Here's an example of qualifications I want to acquire:
  
Experience building and testing ML models or building applied multivariate statistical models, particularly for data classification
 Experience with self-supervised and semi-supervised learning.
 Proficiency with Python and/or related analytical programming languages
 Familiarity with Machine Learning and data processing related Python packages such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, or Tensorflow.
  
Are there any good courses for learning this niche of data science/programming? Theres so many out there its hard to find the good ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 Hopefully this isn't the wrong place for this. Currently working on a clustering problem. Trying to identify strings (email addresses) with a high degree of similarity. Attempting to use scipy's implementation of hierarchical clustering. To prepare the string data for use with the algorithm I transformed the strings to ascii, and then have tried a few different methods to induce normality (log and boxcox). The issue is I'm losing information through the transformation process so I can't convert the data back to the proper email strings after I've clustered them. 
 Any recommendations for how to deal with this problem? Better approaches to solving the overall problem are also very welcome!

In my experience, it's been a common phenomenon that any new business unit (these are mostly non professors) that we pitch our existing work to show how others are using predictive models, they immediately start obsessing over the model (P-value, attributes, change of coef over time - irrespective of the whether it's regression/tree/nn) rather than how the a model might help/fit in their work. Very curious to know is this a common experience for other here? 
 I'm seriously pissed at these P-value warriors - who considers P-value is everything and 0.05 is the heavenly number that'll show them the way to salvation 😤

In my last 2.5 years I've been basically doing ETL with SQL and data visualization with PBI and Tableau and I don't remember almost anything else. So whenever I read the requirements on a new job opportunity I feel that I can't do 50-60% of the job requirements.
 I'm searching for end to end data science projects that I could do and add to my portfolio that would bring me back up to speed on the field.
 I've stumbled upon a site projectpro.io that seem to have tons of data science projects explained and solved but the subscription fee is enormous and tbh the website looks sketchy.
 Could anyone recommend me projects to do or something that would help me regain my skill.
 Any help would be much appreciated.

If reading is the way to become a better writer, I assume that looking at examples of good diagrams is the way to improve how I communicate visually. So let’s share examples of great diagrams about CS, software, hardware, etc and why we think they’re great.
Alternatively, if there’s a site or book that already has a collection focused on visual explanations of computing concepts that we should know about please share that.
I think e.g. Tufte’s books are probably required reading along these lines, but they are much more general purpose and I’m curious about great examples in computing.]]></summary>

I started messing around with a way to verify the checksum of scripts before I execute them. I've found it a really useful tool for installing things like Rust or Deno.
It's written entirely as a shell script, and it's easy to read and understand what's happening.
I hope it may be useful to someone else!

I've seen things ranging from Databricks building tools for data scientists and data engineers that can seemingly only run on notebooks unless you install the notoriously buggy databricks connect to people using the word "notebook" antithesis of good programming habits.
 Recently I've been listening to more talks about interactive vs batch programming and have just been reflecting on how I write code myself. Here's my own set of hot takes:

However, I know for certain that there is an underlying equation linking my independent variables to my dependent variable which explains them fully. The problem is I have no idea how to uncover this relationship. This relationship is likely non-linear but additive. How do I go about decomposing this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having a weird thought here. Let's say next week GTA 10 is coming out, featuring npc's that are self-conscious. They have a personality and can think and learn on their own, (similar to the AI Sophia). They only exist in the game, and there is no way of entering the real world for them.
 My question is, do these npc's have rights? (because they have a personality). Would killing/hurting or whatever may harm them be illegal?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For an example, lets say i take on an NLP project to anonymise and classify some text.
 Typically id start with a simple approch to solve the problem and meet the scope of the project. This might mean using some prebuilt package to anonymise, and a fairly simple tree model to classify.
 This meets the scope and means we can progress to get something into production, wit the view that when its productionised, we can hot swap improvements in the pipeline.
 My question is, how do you justify to the business these improvements if they view the problem as solved? 
 For small changes like replacing a random forest with a lgbm, thats not so bad. However, i mean like replacing the anonymisation package with a more custom CNN or LSTM approach? Thats a much bigger change.
 I feel like the answer is ‘why bother if the business doesn’t see value in it/the current solution doing the job’. But part of our teams role is to progress data science in the business - so we cant just go off what the business thinks as they dont know the art of the possible.
 Yes its down to the data scientist to communicate the value of the work, but how would you justify such a change in this usecase?

 For reference, I'm about to get out of undergrad. I didn't practice much of statistics but through side projects doing data analysis & machine learning, I realized how important this was kind of late imo. I'm vaguely familiar with calculus, it's been a while since I've looked at multivariable, I already have a book for that for review. 
 Looking for statistics mainly. But if you do happen to have one for linear algebra you'd recommend, that'd be appreciated as well. ; )
 Anything to help understand these models more lol.

I find that within my team everyone seems to have side projects going on or be reading textbooks and listening to podcasts about Data Science in their free time. I enjoy working in Data Science and am always eager to learn more, but to be honest, I still see it as work and like to completely disconnect outside of my job to pursue and enjoy other things. I have no real desire to extend the time I spend working on or reading about the field outside of my work hours. Is this likely to hurt me in my career?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Most of the e2e DS tutorials cover feature engineering (OHE, LE, Norm, etc.) and splitting complete data into train and test sets. As you know, in real life, there is no x_train and y_train. You need to do labeling using your raw data. However, there are no tutorials covering tabular data labeling. Are there any recommended tutorials, git repositories, or blog posts to learn and exercise for labeling? It can be related churn labeling, likelihood to buy, or spend forecasting etc.
 TLDR: Looking for tutorials about tabular data labeling (creating target variable).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a tad confused and a noob, please be patient.
 I was watching one of my co-workers analyse and visualise some data and he said he was going to normalise the data. For normalisation I normally used the mean, standard deviation and standarise the data using those.
 However, this is what he did:
 Calculated the regression equation.
 Using the independent variable coefficient and the intercept (from the previous step) he calculated the predicted y.
 Proceeded to substract the actual y against the predicted y and then add the average of all of the predicted y.
 What essentially happened is that he got rid of the independent variable coefficient (if you were to graph it, the trendline would be flat). Now:
 IS this actually normalising data or is it integration? if neither, what would this be? and why should I do it?
 I am asking since he had to go.
