Over the past few months the war has escalated and threats of use of nuclear weapons have been made. Shouldn't the Doomsday Clock reflect that a nuclear conflict is now more imminent?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello ML folks,
 I know this may have been asked a couple of times, but here goes nothing. I am trying a binary classifier. Here is my data dimension
 Approx n=300,000 p=19
 Response rate is 14% 
 Did logistics, rpart, and rf. 10 folds; 2/3rd 1/3rd train test split.
 My maximum AUC is 0.76, But sensitivity and specificity are screwed up. I get a sensitivity of 0.28 and specificity of 0.98. 
 What I understand is given 14%, we have medium class imbalance. And the classifier is biased towards the higher class. Hence high specificity and low sensitivity. I tried under-sampling and oversampling. Tried SMOTE as well. Nothing worked.
 All my predictors are highly statistically significantly associated with the outcome on the logistics model.
 Am i doing something wrong? How would you approach this situation?

 Course focuses on descriptive and predictive analytics for decision-making from a variety of business disciplinary perspectives. Important elements include identification of data-driven decision-making contexts in business, ascertaining data needs, analyzing data, interpreting and commincating results, and ultimately the value proposition of analytics.

 I read that, but then someone told me that it's really a stats course. I thought I got a way without taking stats in ugrad but apparently not 🤷

I felt like I lacked polish, or didn’t speak the same lingo as others on the call. I usually am informal in code reviews I lead etc… and I’m finding it difficult to come across as more “business like” in these upper level meetings. Has anyone else ever experienced this? How do you improve?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m in my first role having graduated this past May. I work as a junior data analyst at a luxury retail firm. 
 I’m actively exploring various industries as well as other career paths within the ever-changing world of data. But honestly I’ve hit of a roadblock on both fronts.
 It’s challenging enough keeping up with demands for various tech stacks as well the changing landscapes of data and ML architectures, especially as these things vary widely between companies and industries.
 To keep it simple: I enjoy working with statistics, I enjoy economics (I studied quantitative Econ at university), and I enjoy explaining presenting findings and concepts to people. That last part cannot be overstated. So much so in fact that many people as surprised when I tell them I work in data analytics. They’re like “oh with your personality how are you not in communications, or a teacher, or salesman?”
 I suppose I’d take a gander at data roles within banking and finance, but a lot of the use cases seem rather mundane to me (risk management, fraud prevention, etc)
 I don’t have the mathematical rigor to get a PhD, but I also didn’t have the undergrad gpa to get into a good business school to move into a consultancy or traditional finance position. So honestly I’ll take any recommendation.
 Above all, I want a sense of meaning and something I can devote a lot of time and energy learning about.

 I work in Operations at a large Supply Chain organization; we provide platform equipment pooling services. That is a fancy way of saying that we own a large number of platforms (think pallets, intermediate bulk containers, etc.), and “rent” them out for use by our customers. Once our customers use them, we collect them at reconditioning factories, sort the bad (damaged, contaminated, etc.) platforms out, and recondition them. We then ship ready-for-use platforms back out to the next customer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you an intermediate-level SQL practitioner? Are you able to turn most of your thoughts into a SQL queries? If so, Congrats! That's not an easy skill to develop 👏. 
 Over time, I've learned that in order to go from SQL intermediate to SQL expert, I need to make my code more efficient, scalable, readable, and easier to debug. 
 That's why I'm excited about Ergest Xheblati free workshop this Thursday, SQL Patterns Every Analyst Should Know. Ergest is the author of Minimum Viable SQL Patterns, and he's been mastering SQL for 15+ years In his workshop, you'll learn about: 
  
Query composition patterns - How to make your complex queries shorter, more legible, and more performant
 Query maintainability patterns - Constructing CTEs that can be reused. In software engineering, it's called the DRY principle (don't repeat yourself)
 Query robustness patterns - Constructing queries that don't break when the underlying data changes in unpredictable ways
 Query performance patterns - Make your queries faster (and cheaper) regardless of specific database you’re using
 Answers to your questions - Ask Ergest whatever you'd like in the live and interactive Q&A

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As teams integrate ML/AI models into production systems running at-scale, they’re increasingly encountering a new obstacle: high GPU costs from running models in production at-scale. While GPUs are used in both model training and production inference, it’s tough to yield savings or efficiencies during the training process. Training is costly because it’s a time-intensive process, but fortunately, it’s likely not happening every day. This blog focuses on optimizations you can make to generate cost savings while using GPUs for running inferences in production. The first part provides some general recommendations for how to more efficiently use GPUs, while the second walks through steps you can take to optimize GPU usage with commonly used architectures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So our professor asked us to pick a topic to build an application for in our AI course and I chose "subjective answer evaluator" because it was the most interesting topic in the list. But my teammates think we won't be able to finish this in a month as it may require learning advanced NLP and we are just beginners in AI. I think I will be able to do it because 1) it's interesting, 2) I will follow the top-down approach and learn the topics as and when I encounter them, 3) It's an application and not a research paper. 
 What do the experts here think? Is it doable or should I pick a different easier topic?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
Excited to be able to share the release of `InvokeAI 2.0 - A Stable Diffusion Toolkit`, an open source project that aims to provide both enthusiasts and professionals a suite of robust image creation tools. Optimized for efficiency, InvokeAI needs only ~3.5GB of VRAM to generate a 512x768 image (and less for smaller images), and is compatible with Windows/Linux/Mac (M1 & M2).
InvokeAI was one of the earliest forks off of the core CompVis repo (formerly lstein/stable-diffusion), and recently evolved into a full-fledged community driven and open source stable diffusion toolkit titled InvokeAI. The new version of the tool introduces an entirely new WebUI Front-end with a Desktop mode, and an optimized back-end server that can be interacted with via CLI or extended with your own fork.
This version of the app improves in-app workflows leveraging GFPGAN and Codeformer for face restoration, and RealESRGAN upscaling - Additionally, the CLI also supports a large variety of features:
- Inpainting 
- Outpainting
- Prompt Unconditioning
- Textual Inversion
- Improved Quality for Hi-Resolution Images (Embiggen, Hi-res Fixes, etc.)
- And more...
Future updates planned included UI driven outpainting/inpainting, robust Cross Attention support, and an advanced node workflow for automating and sharing your workflows with the community.
We're excited by the release, and about the future of democratizing the ability to create. Check out the repo (https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI) to get started, and join us on Discord (https://discord.gg/ZmtBAhwWhy)!

I've found my SQL knowledge to be lacking, so I made a project that uses SQLite as a backend.
As it is intended for self-hosting I aim to make it easy to set up and maintain. Getting it up & running takes no more than a few commands (bar setting up a proxy such as nginx, which is out of scope).
I've set up a "demo" site at https://forum.agreper.com/ if you want to try out the UI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context: I am in the process of applying for my first data science job(s). I have written a cover letter in LaTeX which someone proof-read for me. This person has a lot of experience in business (and was very successful) but not anything science-y. The job I'm in the process of applying for was advertised via a recruiter.
 Problem: The proof-reader stated that I should re-write the cover letter in Word as it "looks better" and recruiters will prefer that as it's something they recognise. I disagree on the first point (but I guess it's subjective) but don't know what to think on the second point. So my question is, should a cover letter be in LaTeX or Word?
 I doubt it matters but just in case, I'm in the UK.
 Edit: In case it wasn't clear (which apparently it wasn't), I'll of course be compiling the LaTeX into a PDF.
 Edit 2: Thanks all for your comments, they have produced some good points to consider.

 Whisper is an automatic State-of-the-Art speech recognition system from OpenAI that has been trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. This large and diverse dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background noise and technical language. 
 The whisper model is available on GitHub. You can download it with the following command directly in the Jupyter notebook:
 !pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git 
 Whisper needs ffmpeg installed on the current machine to work. Maybe you already have it installed, but its likely your local machine needs this program to be installed first. 
 OpenAI refers to multiple ways to install this package, but we will be using the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a linear programming problem in which the result from a classifier is used as a variable (binary variable). Only problem is that the classifier itself uses variables in the linear programming problem. Anyone have done something like this before and have some advice on how to proceed? The reason why I do it this way is that I guess I will find the optimal solution faster than if I do it iteratively with some sort of genetic algorithm.
 It looks like this:
 Argmax(Y) = v1p1c1+v2p2c2+.....+v24p24c24)
 With:
 c24=<c23=<...=<c1, a belongs to (0,1).
 p_max>=p24>=p23>=...>=p1
 v>=0.1 and sum([v1,v2...,v24]) = V
 With p_max and V being constant.
 Each c_n is the classifier value and calculated with each value of p_n and v_n along with some other constant values.
 What I think is hard to implement is the condition in which order the classifier values should be arranged.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need advice. I'm a third year CS student, and want to make a Voice Assistant to control and navigate a PC, specifically aimed for blind people in Pakistan, for my semester project. It'll take urdu voice input and handle basic things like searches and selection, but then because it's aimed at the blind, also things like current position, what's on the screen at the moment, reading out articles, rereading what's already been entered into the search bar etc. I have a basic idea of the things I'll need, like an urdu speech recognition library, text-to-speech convertor for the assistant to be able to speak and the PyAutoGUI Library to actually control the cursor and keyboard input etc., but honestly apart from that I'm completely lost. Is this project too ambitious or too basic? What else will I need? Should I have an assistant that only recognises set commands like go back, read etc. Or should I try to go for an assistant that understands the semantics of whatever the user says and grasps what it needs to do from that? Is that even possible? Also should I restricted the scope to just a browser, like as a chrome extension handling searches and websites etc., or general computer control?

Could you match the salary you would make at a decently sized company? I’m thinking of literal consulting (e.g. career, data strategy), as well as also doing something closer to freelancing on a project basis.
