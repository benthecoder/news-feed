        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a set of distributions and I need to tell which distribution is the most consistent, meaning which one has values that are all very close.
 Finding the distribution with the smallest standard deviation came to mind, but there are sometimes major outliers that shouldn’t be removed unless necessary.
 Anyone have any ideas? Thanks for your time

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all! Working on MLOps without the resources of big tech? Everything you’ve always wanted to know about Reasonable Scale MLOps will be uncovered by Ciro Greco (Ex-Vice President of AI at Coveo, co-founder and CEO at Tooso) and Jacopo Tagliabue (Ex-Director of AI at Coveo, co-fonder and CTO at Tooso) in an upcoming Sphere course in the spring. 
 At its essence, Reasonable Scale means that ML systems should be designed and deployed with four explicit constraints in mind: 
  
Financial impact 
 Team size
 Data volume
 Computing resources
  
The course will focus on the link between MLOps and business strategy: because Reasonable Scale companies have several constraints, choices that appear exquisitely technical can play a very deep role in implementing a sound business strategy.
 You’ll have the opportunity to learn from Ciro and Jacopo’s experience from garage, scale-up and IPO scale where they had the opportunity to learn from their mistake and with Coveo contribute to R&D research in EcommerceAI more than any other company in 2020 (second only to Amazon).
 Find out more and join them for some hard-won MLOps wisdom from the trenches: https://www.getsphere.com/cohorts/machine-learning-at-reasonable-scale?source=Sphere-Communities-r-artificial

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently working for a large engineering company, usually based in the European HQ office (where all the Data & AI/Engineering team sits), but now based out of sales office in South America on a 6 month secondment.
 I am essentially the link between the local sales offices (in 8 countries across the Americas) and HQ, where all the digital product development is done. I document the current data collection processes and attempt to drive traction for various digital offerings that are in development. I am in constant communication with multiple internal teams and external customers.
 I have a masters in Data Science & Analytics, but also 3 years of sales experience - if that puts my background in perspective.
 Anyway, would like to tidy up my CV and am struggling what job title this would constitute. My direct report says I am an "Evangelist" but not a fan of that classification.
 Any suggestions are welcome!

We got into finance early during our time at MIT. Tarek worked at Goldman and Citadel, Luana worked at Bridgewater and Citadel. We noticed something common across all these places: a lot of trading stemmed from an opinion on a future event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tldr; How to convince stakeholders that your product is working as intended and the can trust the output of it?
 Background: I have build this rather simple data pipeline which transforms the input data, applies some simple aggregations (not even the harmonic mean), some simple filters and produces plots of the data. Now, the stakeholders which are the sales team and my boss don't trust the output of the whole thing (anymore).
 Measures I took to build trust:
  
included unit tests with test cases in order to verify aggregation and construction of metrics
 separate aggregation and plotting into different steps of the pipeline
 made a diagram with data flow and all definitions
 rely mostly on well tested third party libraries (pandas and matplotlib)
 Versioning and documenting the code and the input to have reproducible pipeline runs
  
Reasons why I think they don't trust it: * I am the only person developing it, so there is no review process and I could test my own logical errors with the unit tests * Communication between the sales team and me was suboptimal, i.e. the meaning of some metrics was not clear to them and I did not always get what the expected of some metrics were * The underling input data quality was poor and changing often but was out of my control. In the end it was blamed on the product even it was not it's fault * Development in production due to changing requirements, tight deadlines and feature request, which lead to minor bugs
 I am interested in your thoughts how I can improve the situation and how I can avoid similar problems in the future.

 It is possible to do a lot of things with ImportXML, but there are a lot of cons as well:
  
If the target website data requires some cleanup post-processing, it's getting very complicated since you are now "programming with excel formulas", rather painful process compared to regular code writing in conventional programming languages
 There is no proper launch & cache control so the function can be triggered occasionally and if the HTTP request fails, cells will be populated with ERR! values

I think I get the general gist of the training part, how images are represented as matrix of pixel values, how a feature map is generated through matrix multiplication, and that weights are updated through backpropagation with respect to an error rate calculated from the prior prediction and the actual value. However, if I understand correctly, this is just the training right? How does it classify new data? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an engineering background. I am exploring a career move into data science. Was offered a senior data scientist role at a large IT firm. My core responsibilities include "data exploration and providing structured data for analysis", which to me sounds like a data analyst role and not data scientist.
 Need some suggestions if I should proceed. From what I read online, data scientists do spend a lot of time exploring right data sources and structuring documents for optimum training and visualizations. How much time do you typically spend in these activities (in terms of % of work per week)? I want to see how much time I will get for learning "cool" stuff like training models and playing with algorithms. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'm working on a class project about the impact words have on how we perceive migrants. To develop the project based on this idea, I would like to show stock images and then show how they would change when generating variations (with an AI tool) of the same image. Essentially, to demonstrate how language can shape the perception that one has about a subject.
 Overall, I want to know if it is possible to develop an AI tool that generates variations of an initial image when adding text descriptors. Perhaps someone accessing the website could interact with the tool by adding textual descriptions that change the photo. This way, they would observe how stereotypes, words, and commonly used phrases change the original photos. Would you consider this feasible?
 As a result of using Google Translate, my idea wasn't clear. Hopefully, you'll understand my question better now since I translated it myself.
 Thanks in advance! :)
