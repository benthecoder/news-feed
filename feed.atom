        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Longtime SPSS user using statsmodels in Python for the first time. I have a dataset with the following factors: 
 Factor A: Group with two levels Factor B: Group with two levels The outcome measure (Y) is repeated for each subject over two time points. Each subject is in a different group. 
 I’m trying to see if there is an interaction effect of group allocation on the outcome measure as a function of time. I think I know how to model the groups (Y ~ A*B), but I’m lost as how to model the repeated measure factor of Time. 
 Can anyone help me with this and/or direct me to some resources for learning how to write model formulas?

 I've been laid off for about 2 months now and recently just got a job offer. The company is located in the UK and I am located in the US. The contract states I would be an "independent contractor" not an "employee" and the pay is in GBP and there is no healthcare offered.
 What does independent contrator mean? Is this a standard practice for hiring somebody from a foreign country? What does this mean for my taxes? Should I even take this job? Thanks!

Then there is the dependent variable column Gender which has values 0 - for Male, and 1 - for Female. After categorical encoding the Favourite Colour column I'll end up with 2 Independent variable (IV) columns (as we drop one column cause of the dummy variable trap). 
 But then in a new test dataset the Favourite Color column only contains values Red, and Blue. After encoding I'll then have 1 IV column, but my model was trained on a dataset with 2 IVs. How will my model be able to run considering the input size is now different?
 I know that I have run into this problem when creating a Random Forest Model (it throws an array that the model was expecting a certain input size but got a different one), but I am asking about models in general.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm training a Poisson model on count data and passing in log(distance) as my offset term. This is how I called I made the model:
 model <- glm(next_target_both_collision_count ~ weekday_daytime_brake_count +
 weekend_daytime_brake_count + weekend_nighttime_distraction_count
 + weekday_daytime_distraction_count
 + weekend_daytime_following_distance_count +
 weekday_nighttime_following_distance_count +
 weekday_daytime_following_distance_count,
 maxit = 100,data = train_df, family = poisson(),
 offset=log(train_df$distance))
 ​
 However, the length of my train set is about 100,000 and the length of my test set is about 10,000. As a result, when I try to run the following code:
 ​
 predictions <- predict(model, type = "response", newdata = test_df)
 I get the following error message:
 Warning in offset + eval(object$call$offset, newdata) :
 longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
 Warning in predictor + offset :
 longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
 ​
 How do I properly call the predict function so I don't get this error? I tried updating the model's offset by doing
 model$offset <- log(test_df$distance)
 predictions <- predict(model, type = "response", newdata = test_df)
 ​
 But the warning still pops up.

 I am working on a project where health care providers will be collecting data about the patient. The patient is fully aware we are collecting the data as part of the program. My organization is not HIPAA compliment so we need all data de-identified. 
 What way can this be done? The offices will be sending me monthly blood pressure updates so they have to be able to look at the chart and be able to determine which patient is which I can’t just number them 1-100 or something. My first thought was patient first/last name initial plus birth day/month but I believe for hipaa that is not stripped enough. Appreciate the help and fully understand y’all are not lawyers but I am not finding any concrete resources online!

 Being into the topic of web scraping and deep learning lately, I am asking myself how well the two topics could be combined. How feasible would it for example be to build a deep learning model that could extract the relevant information from a screenshot of a website? More generally, I would say that a lot of e-commerce sites are build up almost the same way (structure and product display) when it comes to their visual appearance. Would it here be possibel to build and train a generalizable model that could extract the necessary product information of other e-commerce sites by getting a screenshot of a page as input? Additionally, what architecture would you probably use, a RNN like model and are there already similar solutions?

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34055132</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/Infisical/infisical"/>
        <updated>2022-12-19T17:52:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, we open-sourced Infisical (https://github.com/Infisical/infisical) - a simple, end-to-end encrypted tool to sync environment variables across your team and infrastructure. You can use it to store environment variables and inject them into your applications locally or into CI/CD and production infrastructure. It can be used with any language/framework and is platform independent with a super easy setup.
We know secret managers exist but, in our experience, they’re too complicated, not comprehensive, not user-friendly, or a mix of all three — other nicer ones are closed-source and don’t have self-hosted options available. That’s why we’re on a mission to make secret management more accessible to every developer — not just security teams.
We’ve launched this repo under the MIT license so any developer can use the tool. The goal is to not charge individual developers. We make money by charging a license fee for some future enterprise features as well as providing a hosted version and support.
In the coming weeks, we plan to add features like key rotation, access logs + more integrations. We’d love to hear your thoughts and any feature requests!
Give it a try (https://github.com/Infisical/infisical), and let us know what you think!

 I wanted to know if anyone had any experience in working with Siamese Models before who could help understand my issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Everyone. I hope guys are doing well. I am about to start a new job as a data analyst with major focus on building dashboards in various tools like Excel, Microsoft PowerBI and Tableau to derive meaningful insights while I am also tasked with making executive level presentations displaying those insights strategically.
 My question is that what frameworks, methods or processes do I follow to derive those insights in the 1st place? Any suggestions would be highly helpful.

 So I have 8 separate spreadsheets, filled up with stock market trading data (backtesting), and I'm stuck in professionally filtering and comparing the outcomes.
 E.g. in 1 spreadsheet there are data from ~700 trades that have taken place, with 6 diffent criteria noted down for each of them (including date, time, size of the market move etc.) To each of the trades, there are several outcomes percentage wise. (e.g. if it reaches a pre-defined level, I close the trade or if it reaches 1:2 risk reward ratio I close the trade etc.)
 I would like to evaulate this data the best way possible. I'd like to see that how each result column depends on each of the criterias. Basically, I want to compare the % of return based on a lot of existing data to see what aspect can definitely, stat…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[when performing logistic regression, the predicted outputs are typically binomial. A typical threshold value of 0.5 is applied, and yhat = 1 if sigmoid(z) >0.5, and 0 if <0.5. Would it be reasonable to split this into more categories? Or do i have to use softmax regression. 
 For example im working on a cancer prediction project, and would like to generate the following outputs: 
 If sigmoid(z) < 0.05, output= benign
 If sigmoid(z) 0.05 to 0.95, output = recommend dr's review
 If sigmoid(z) >0.95, output = malignant 
 Would this be incorrect?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am trying to train an existing RoBERTa model variant in my own language (czech), to generate text, based on a prompt. I have a dataset of about 70 books prepared and formatted in plain text, but now I am faced with the issue of loading the data for additional training of the already pretrained model (the model I am using is called robeczech-base). When I tried using
 dataset = LineByLineTextDataset( tokenizer=tokenizer, file_path="./dataset.txt", block_size=512 ) 
 I get an error with the index being out of range, which, after some research, seems to indicate that my dataset has a vocabulary size out of the range of the one the model was trained on. This leads me to believe that my method of loading the single plaintext file into a dataset might be incorrect. I wasn't able to find many tutorials on this subject, since most assume the use of a labeled dataset, or multiple datasets for training and testing, which don't seem like they apply to my situation, since I want the model to generate text similar to the ones it has in my dataset, not classify it in some way for question answering (the dataset contains mostly classic fantasy literature in my native language).
 Do you have any idea of what I am doing wrong? Is my approach completely incorrect? Is a RoBERTa like-model even suited for this task? Do you have any resources, pertaining to long-form text generation (aka. short stories) tutorials and guides, that I could use? I have been stuck for about a week, so any help would be much appreciated :)

 If I ask what sandponics is, I get an average answer. 12 months ago it wouldn't have a clue......it is getting better, but when you ask for deeper info it fails majorly.
 My question is, can I take research papers and upload them to AI, and then get some useful info out of it? I don't mean summary or alternative text, is AI ready to understand or is it still too young?
 It seems like it can be 'tricked' by asking the same question in different ways AI will provide different answers.
