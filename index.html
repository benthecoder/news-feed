              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Hello everyone. Does anybody knows how XGBoost treats missing values in the Y dataset when a model is trained? I know it handles well missing values in the independent variables but I have not found what happens if there are some in the Y dataset. I am doing several regression models and it seems to work fine but dont quite understand yet if the NaN rows are excluded automatically or if the training of the model is affected in some way. There are just a few NaNs by the way (less than 5%)
 Thanks a lot

                <p>In my circles, the accounting vs data debate seems to come up every so often, and I am wondering as an accounting student in my fourth year of university with a year of accounting internships under my belt, do people often switch over from accounting to data, and is it worth it? If anyone would like to share their experiences/journey it would be appreciated. (i.e. when did you make the switch, do you miss any aspects of accounting, do you like data a lot more, how easy it is to switch, and a comparison of t…</p>

 Apologies in advance if I&#39;m breaking any rules or if this is more suited to the weekly thread. 
 I&#39;ve been working as a Data Analyst for a healthcare company for the past year. A lot of my work surrounds creating queries to track certain metrics then building dashboards to create insights using visualization tools. 
 I do like the field, but unsure of where to move next. I do enjoy the coding aspect of my position (Lots of SQL, don&#39;t like excel as much), as well as hacking away at a pro…</p>

 the tick: 128 = 1 second so would probably normalize this as the maximum amount a round can last is 1 minute 55 seconds + 40 seconds (usually lower amount than this). 10 vectors of [91x1] which would be one hot encoded to break down roughly 90 in game locations that I have labelled.…</p>

                <p>Hi guys, 
 I&#39;m a newbie to artificial intelligence and am making a project of mine with Keras API and I know the basics: what is neural network, what it consists of, how it is trained what is needed for training...
 Project&#39;s job is to spill out 2D coordinates (x,y) from a single picture that is provided to it. I know I need to use CNN (convolutional neural network) and also know howt to make a model in code, but I dont know how to make a dataset in python code.

                <p>A novel per-pixel lighting representation in a deep learning framework, which explicitly models the diffuse and the specular components of appearance, producing relit portraits with convincingly rendered effects like specular highlights. This might be a great extension for more realistic online (Zoom) calls with a background!

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Title. I got into crypto fairly recently, in March 2021. Having not experienced a bear market ever before, I’m really keen to hear what the transition was like and to learn about some of the lessons that it taught you. 
 Here’s my take on it as a newbie: there’s a huge run up, BTC peaks, a month later, Alts peak, and then the market dips 70% and we go into a bear. 
 I’d also like to know how did you handle your investments? Did you just go into stable coins, or did you get some BTC too? What would you recom…</p>

 I have a friend who bought a lot of Doge at 1 cent and he told everyone and it&#39;s caused a lot of resentment.
 Almost always best to keep it a secret.

[Epistemic status: my current view, but I haven’t read all the stuff on this topic even in the LessWrong community, let alone more broadly.]
There is a line of thought that says that advanced AI will tend to be ‘goal-directed’—that is, consistently doing whatever makes certain favored outcomes more likely—and that this is to do with the ‘coherence arguments’. Rohin Shah, and probably others1, have argued against this. I want to argue against them.

I just finished Karen Pryor’s “Don’t Shoot the Dog: the New Art of Teaching and Training.” Partly because a friend points out that it’s not on Audible and therefore she can’t possibly read it, here are the notes I took and some thoughts. It’s a quick, easy read.
The book applies behavioral psychology to training animals and people. The author started off as a dolphin trainer at an aquarium park in the 1960s and moved on to horses, dogs, and her own children. There are…</p>

After giving a talk, he went out for what turned out to be a late night of drinking with some professors.

He and Bateson became lifelong friends, and the Mendelian genetics that Bateson and his team championed—and that remains the core of the field of genetics to this day—was burned into Vavilov’s sci…</p>

This is a story where the alignment problem is somewhat harder than I expect, society handles AI more competently than I expect, and the outcome is worse than I expect. It also involves inner alignment turning out to be a surprisingly small problem. Maybe the story is 10-20th percentile on each of those axes. At the end I’m going to go through some salient ways you could vary the story.

Known simply as “her,” she would become the star of My Octopus Teacher, the Oscar-nominated Netflix documentary and surprise pandemic hit that told the story of Foster’s unlikely relationship with that eight-armed mollusk.
