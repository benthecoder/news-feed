 Each BANANO contains about 422 mg of potassium in comparison to bitcoin which has 0 mg. Potassium is important for staying healthy and functional. It’s highly unlikely that bitcoin will ever be able to upgrade itself with potassium contents as that would require it to fork.
 Supply
 There is currently about 1 billion BAN coins in comparison to only 18 million bitcoins. That means that over 1 billion people can experience the nutritional value of banano in comparison to only 18 million bitcoins.

 Ethereum Classic (ETC) is not the same as the real Ethereum (ETH). They forked a long time ago, which is why they share the name. But nothing is being done on ETC. All those ERC-20 tokens live on ETH, not ETC. Don&#39;t be fooled.
 Same goes for Bitcoin. There is only one BTC. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV), etc are all forks of Bitcoin. Which means that they tried to make a change to BTC but failed, and ende…</p>

                <p>I work in the financial industry and I just went to ask all of my co workers what they know about Crypto currency. They said they have heard of BTC and only recently heard of DOGE... but have no idea what they actually are or their functions. The demographic is quite large, from High school age to retirement age.
 Go ask the people around you if they know! That should make it pretty clear what stage we are STILL at!
 So yeah.... I think you are still early.

                <p>I mined dogecoin in my first year of university in 2013. It was a fun thing to do in-between studying for exams with my floormates. I managed to mine 91k coins. I never touched them since 2013. Thankfully I kept my old laptop.
 It had been on my mind even during the last bull market in 2017 if I could even access my dogecoins. Never got around to try, was busy with university/life. And I was more than happy to just keep the dogecoins and see what happens. It was so exciting back then to see DogeCoin go up i…</p>

                <p>Yes, there is a psychological condition for people who, suddenly, get rich. Paranoia, isolation and guilt are some of the symptoms. For people in crypto, generally the wealth increasing can be seen in real time, as most of these are long term holders. However, seeing the coin pumping and actually cashing out are different things. Cashing out gives the sense of &quot;this is real&quot;, and a plan is needed to avoid/mitigate the SWS. Preferably, you&#39;ll have a therapist taking care of you. Make no mistake…</p>

                <p>ETC is a literal scam coin that has been 51% attacked not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES. Imo this is far worse for the crypto sphere than Doge potentially flipping BNB and making it to the top 3 as a massive pump n dump. I don’t see how people don’t get wrecked on something like ETC. A lot of people think regulations will spark the next bear market, its coins like ETC that will spark the regulations. (I understand they’re coming regardless)

                <p>Across 7000+ coins and 463 exchanges! - Not only is the growth truly amazing, the size and variety of the marketplace is also growing massively. BTC slowly losing dominance (but still growing in its own right) I think is a great sign of a maturing market that is becoming more independent from its most well known and largest coin. 
 My personal opinion is that we will see ETH climb to 20% in the near future, and that this year will be absolutely critical for fulfilling promises.

ML is fun, &quot;hot&quot; and all that, but I&#39;m more interested in taking a higher level approach to inferring insights from data (via ML or otherwise). Also, despite my title, I haven&#39;t ever built a data base or used cloud computing. It&#39;s been mostly local computations, csv files, pandas, etc. So I&#39;d love to patch up those holes so I can do more properly data science work.…</p>

I&#39;m curious when the entry-level coding tests (stuff like dynamic programming, longest increasing subsequence, etc.) I&#39;m used to will start to disappear in interviews.
 This is assuming someone with significant experience won&#39;t be bugged with these type of interview questions, could be wrong.

                <p>My friend Robert Burton, a neurologist and author, wanted to share a song with me last year, and sent me a link to an NPR Tiny Desk Concert. “It’s wonderful to see truly new and inspiring music,” he wrote. I clicked open the link to a band who appeared to have journeyed from their mountain village in Russia to busk for tourists in the city square.

And philosophy has no other point of departure than this.” The word, which contains the root thauma, the same that appears in thaumaturgy, has often been translated as “wonder.” Philosophy is born out of amazement mixed with the curiosity that arises from facing something inexplicable that fascinates and transcends us.

                <p>Many marine biologists identify a gateway drug into their obsession, and for Heather Koldewey, it was the seahorse. Who can blame her? Seahorses seem to have evolved not entirely in the ocean, but also by way of a whimsical storybook, in which animal body parts are all mixed up. A fish with the head of a horse? A male that gets pregnant, gives birth, and is monogamous?
Seahorses led her not only to her career as the head of marine and freshwater conservation at the London Zoological Society, but to her effo…</p>

[Epistemic status: my current view, but I haven’t read all the stuff on this topic even in the LessWrong community, let alone more broadly.]
There is a line of thought that says that advanced AI will tend to be ‘goal-directed’—that is, consistently doing whatever makes certain favored outcomes more likely—and that this is to do with the ‘coherence arguments’. Rohin Shah, and probably others1, have argued against this. I want to argue against them.

After giving a talk, he went out for what turned out to be a late night of drinking with some professors.

This is a story where the alignment problem is somewhat harder than I expect, society handles AI more competently than I expect, and the outcome is worse than I expect. It also involves inner alignment turning out to be a surprisingly small problem. Maybe the story is 10-20th percentile on each of those axes. At the end I’m going to go through some salient ways you could vary the story.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>It might surprise you to find out how little evidence there is to support the idea that boosting students’ “grit”—their propensity to tenaciously attack difficult problems they encounter rather than give up—is a reliably effective way to improve their school performance or to close long-standing education gaps. After all, you’ve probably heard otherwise. Grit is everywhere. By the time you read this, it will have been a golden child of the world of education for well over a decade. It’s a sexy, appealing id…</p>

Most problems can be separated pretty cleanly into two categories: things we basically understand, and things we basically don’t understand. Some things we basically understand: building bridges and skyscrapers, treating and preventing infections, satellites and GPS, cars and ships, oil wells and gas pipelines and power plants, cell networks and databases and websites.

I'm here to tell you a story about what it was like to be a rationalist decades before the Sequences and the formation of the modern rationalist community. &nbsp;It is not the only story that could be told, but it is one that runs parallel to and has important connections to Eliezer Yudkowsky's and how his ideas developed.
