For me that’s actually my current job writing software for cargo drones.  I think it’s one of those technologies that genuinely will change the world, mostly for the better, and it’s super exciting to be in it from the ground up.  I’m going to quit in a few months because hoo it’s a lot of work and I’m a bit burned out… but there’s a 50% chance I’ll come back after a season or two and say “hey, turns out everything else in the world is less cool, want me back?”</span>

                              <span>Has anyone used GSTools or SKGStat for kriging? 
 SKGStat allows you to set a max lag distance used for regression (when solving for weights) which speeds up computation significantly. I noticed there is something similar in the Variogram class in GSTools but the actually Kriging seems much slower so I’m not sure if it’s abiding by it for inference.
 Any help is appreciated!

                              <span>I’m definitely a beginner in this field, so forgive me if what I’m looking for is a really complex problem. 
 Im an avid backpacker, I love maps and I have basic coding skills. Something I love doing in the backcountry is finding areas unaffected by logging that aren’t well known, but it’s really hard to find spots like this these days. I don’t know if this is even possible, but I am interested in finding an application similar to LiveEO that can use false color to identify and differentiate between young and old trees of a specific species. 
 If this is a really tall ask, then I guess I’m looking for advice on how to start learning what I need to know to be able to do this myself sometime in the future. Thanks in advance.
 Edit: Maybe a tool that looks for trees with abnormally large crown size compared with its surroundings would be a simpler way of going about this?

                              <span>Hi everyone! I work at a F50 company as a Data Scientist (Modeling). Every few days, I find myself with a task where I am trying to debug someone’s code to find out why the output is not what it should be. It feels like I am not writing a lot of code from scratch. Don’t get me wrong, while debugging codes, I am getting to learn a lot but not as much as writing from scratch.
 Does your job also require to read and debug someone else’s written code? And how often are you doing it?
 Thank you!

                              <span>I saw this interview with Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, and I was surprised to hear several bold claims about the capabilities of AGI in the near future. He defines AGI as an AI/ML model with human-level intelligence. He seems to imply that current neural network architectures and techniques will get us there. At one point there’s an aside about whether we (humans) should still have kids with AGI an inevitability.
 I’m struggling to understand how he can make the leap from where we are today to this sci-fi-like AGI future he describes. I’m very impressed by the work at OpenAI, so maybe Sam has access to tech that most practitioners in data science haven’t seen yet. With that being said, his interview rang a couple hype alarm bells with me.
 What am I missing? Is AGI really around the corner?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Sorry if my written English is not correct, I&#x27;m not a native speaker. I&#x27;m a geochemist and I work with multiple disciplines including hydrogeologists and geostatistical analysts in a multinational engineering firm.
 The problem we&#x27;ve got is that chemical data is always sent in different kinds of (horrible) excel sheets from multiple sources (labs, clients, collages from other departments). We need a system that is able to centralize all chemical data in a database. This needs to be done online and users need to be able to log in and upload data and query data using a web interface. 
 We are still in the design process for this and we want to make a prototipe. I am a python user, with a lot of experience processing data using python: pandas, numpy etc..., but I have always worked in CSV and have no experience using SQL or any web platform. I was thinking of doing a simple thing in django or other python web framework, but then I thought, maybe there is some premade tool to do this, for example a django project for this purpose that can be easily modified or just a plugin for wordpress, wix or squarespace or something like that.
 Does anyone has an idea what is the best place to start?
 I&#x27;d be very grateful if anyone can share their thoughts or tips about this problem.

                              <span>I&#x27;m just wondering if there&#x27;s any existing products that feature online Jupyter Lab editing and sharing like the CodePen/Codesandbox/Replit for web development and the OverLeaf for LaTeX. If there isn&#x27;t such a tool and no one else is developing one, is it possible that I could develop a simpler version of it?

                              <span>I find it a huge turn off when the recruiter casts such a wide net on the job market and make prospect individual spend 2-3 days of effort to &quot;earn&quot; an interview. Like, do they even have time to assess all submitted codes and ppt? End of the day it&#x27;s back to skimming through the works like they did with resume, no? I personally ignore such recruiters. Anyone with opposing views? I would like to see from another perspective.

                              <span>✅ Leverage your experience, skills, and flexibility to understand where the needs of the client are before they articulate them.
 This is developed more and more over time, but keeping this in mind can help you become an effective advisor from day 1.
 ✅Having mastery over technology concepts helps a hell of a lot but it&#x27;s only half the battle.
 The other half is knowing how to explain them to business people and then relating that concept to a business problem they are having.
 ✅ Consulting is built on trust, and trust is developed in a number of different ways.
 Becoming a trusted advisor to a client is a key step, that means walking them through the good and bad, and making sure honesty is present in the relationship.
 Having your team become known for providing this, as well as an open and thoughtful approach helps future clients consider what you are offering.
 ✅ Regular feedback and communication is critical
 There is this saying in consulting, “as long as you&#x27;re 5 minutes ahead of the client” which I find to be an interesting thing.
 ✅ Developing an agile and project management mindset greatly helps to ensure that your projects stay on target and ultimately address the problem statement.
 There are new challenges, learning challenges, thinking challenges, planning challenges. There is success, there is failure but at the end of the day, it’s fun.

                              <span>For some states, with only 1% of data, there was a confident projection. Then for some other states, with much more data in, still no projection could be made. This made me think maybe for some states priors were a determinant factor. But i have doubts. 
 What is the model used here? How is the inference made? I want to be able to do a similar analysis and predict the next elections myself and then compare my results with Nate Silver’s. Please provide some good sources to learn this. I have good foundation in both classical and bayesian statistics, and probability theory.

 I tried to watch a few, but they all were painfully bad. Like starting feature engineering before checking data types and bumping head against the wall every time python returns a types error, or saving cvs and starting excel to see unique values in columns manually instead of using .value_counts method etc.
 I am a data analyst sql power bi monkey and in no way a very advanced Python user, just know some and have a bit of practical experience. My knowledge isn’t enough to be good myself, but enough to see a moron pretending being competent.
 I don’t really want to watch some exoteric ML mamba jambo, just a competent person doing basic stuff really well, learn something and have fun. 
 Are there people you can recommend?

                              <span>I’m reading this book: Bullshit jobs, and supposedly, the world is rife with people who answer yes to one of these questions:
a) Although you are required to do your job, you secretly believe it is pointless and should not need to be performed.
b) Although you are required to do your job, you secretly believe it is pointless and does not contribute to the world.
One poll found 37% answered yes to a question like that.
I’ve never had a job that was total BS but I did have days as an Eng Manager where I felt like I attended meetings and received information and then attended other meetings and disseminated it. I was acting as a node in a complicated corporate phone tree.
Another example, a QA found bugs and verified bugs that would never be prioritized and fixed. Another might be someone who is propping up some bloated code that they could fix, but for Kafkaesque reasons, that’s not the job
So have you ever had a bs job? What was it like?</span>

                              <span>So I came to know about hotpot colourize old photo, and I started playing with it, using random black and white photos from diff website
 So one photo had a white girl and the colourised photo had golden blonde hair with slightly whitish brown skin 
 I was intrigued by how it chooses colour
 So I added a lion, and the colorized photo was closed to real, tawny brown colour
 then I added the photo of Indian boys playing with water and they had dark skin with black hair, they could have been slightly lighter skin, but still pretty close to accurate
 Then I added a black woman with Afro hair and she got dark skin, it was not that great coloured, but pretty close
 And then I lastly added a Japanese woman and she got light skin 
 And then I added Indonesian man, got dark skin
 does AI know what ethnicity the person in the image belongs to?
 if so, then pretty intriguing and scary at same time
 thanks for your response, have a great day/night

                              <span>This academic plagiarist has gotten hundreds of thousands of dollars for AI ethics research(https://www.umu.se/globalassets/qbank/andreastheodorouvirginiadignum-26433crop001155650resize1154649autoorientquality90density150stripextensionjpgid16.jpg?format&#x3D;webp&amp;mode&#x3D;crop&amp;width&#x3D;1280):
 $300000 for EXPLAIN (2022-25) where he is the primary investigator for Umeå University. Funded by the Vinnova under Eureka ITEA/4 AI Cluster.
 $140000 for the project &quot;RAIN&quot;(that appears to be just a dubious presentation long after the funder has forgotten about their money)
 and several hundred thousand dollars more for other &quot;research projects&quot; related to AI ethics and transparency.
 The funniest part is that he claimed on a number of occasions that he has been cleared of the accusations by NPOF(a Swedish institution investigating academic misconduct) but NPOF writes the following:
  
Thank you for your inquiryWe received a report regarding Andreas Theodorou and his dissertation in 2020. Theodorou made the dissertation in the UK. The dissertation is not made within Swedish jurisdiction and can not be investigated by Npof.Kind regardsRegistrator
  
and his alma mater for obvious reasons refuses to investigate him.
 All the while he is being aggressively promoted by some Virginia Dignum a self-promoting AI-ethics professor who among academics is considered highly proficient in academic politics.

                              <span>Sometimes, a painting in words is worth a thousand pictures. I think about this more and more, in our compulsively visual culture, which increasingly reduces what we think and feel and see -- who and what we are -- to what can be photographed. I think of Susan Sontag, who called it &quot;aesthetic consumerism&quot; half a century before Instagram. In a small act of resistance, I offer The Unphotographable -- Saturdays, a lovely image in words drawn from centuries of literature: passages transcendent and transportive, depicting landscapes and experiences radiant with beauty and feeling beyond what a visual image could convey.</span>
