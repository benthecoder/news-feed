                <p>This transaction could be anything depending on a website like in my case(financial website) it could range from opening a bank account/ linking an account,etc etc. Also the problem with using common metrics bounce rate,exit rate is that it completely disregard the intention of the visitors, maybe the person is just there for explorative purpose and if he doesn&#39;t perform an action that not necessarily means it&#39;s a friction point given the intention

                <p>I’m a data science student and learned about how machine learning is used in the stock market. Before I waste time scraping some data and attempting my own multiple linear regression, I’m sure someone here has done this or does this. Is it worth it? Or is crypto too volatile to reliably predict?

                <p>Hi everyone,
 I&#39;ve developed an app that uses the latest advancement in text generation AI (GPT-3) to find ideas, recipes, captions for photos, and much more, just from your inputs.
 I&#39;m trying to constantly improve the outputs of the generator, but the project is young and I need feedback as much as possible.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>It’s been a long time, 353 days exactly since Reddit has released moons, and this is a pretty important milestone IMO, with 12 distribution cycles happening, close to 60,000,000/150,000,000 moons distributed, and a milestone of $0.10 per moon hit. I feel like moons and community points in general have a really bright future, and they have really changed peoples lives, because farming moons in some countries allows you to earn multiple times better than a minimum wage job. Onward to the moon!
 Edit: for ever…</p>

                <p>The only value any currency has, is the value the people believe it has.
  
Yes doge has no other value other than a currency, and Bitcoin already has that roll.
 
Yes other cryptocurrencys have more use cases like smart contracts and dapps
 
Yes dogecoin is mined at an insane rate, so every second it is losing it&#39;s value. (Funny how crypto bro&#39;s will always point out the way governments are over printing cast, but dogecoin is cool)

                <p>I have invested what I can afford in projects I believe in, but being young and not having a lot of capital at my disposal means that I (and probably a lot of other people too) won’t be able to capitalize big time. Don’t get me wrong, I love seeing my investments grow to new time highs. But knowing if I was born a few years earlier I would’ve invested more and invested sooner, is kind of a bummer. 
 I guess some new project will come about in a couple of years time, but it’s still a little sad to just miss …</p>

 In my country the dollar feels like it&#39;s x20 more powerful, so while 10 moons may not seem like anything in great countries like the United States or Canada, here these 10 moons are sufficient for a dinner for one. Dinner from strangers is unheard of here and many are hungry. I have to say thank you so much!…</p>

                <p>Although BTC started to tank a little today, ETH just reached a new ATH around 2920$ it is so exciting to see it moving on its own. This is only good for the future of crypto as a whole.
 Maybe in the future this will change the time we spend at a bear market because not everything&#39;s tanking at the same time.

                <p>Hi! So, I&#39;m new to crypto and I follow the &quot;don&#39;t invest money you can&#39;t afford to lose&quot; motto. The challenges of trying to get into crypto are numerous. A few examples of the challenges for a newbie trying to figure this out:

You need to find an exchange or exchanges to buy crypto. Okay, I&#39;ll just sign-up. Sure, just fill out this information, provide your SS#, take a picture of your passport or driver&#39;s license, then upload a picture of your face, and all other p…</p>

              <summary>April Update: Free Crypto, The importance and how to get it. From Coinbase Earn to automation - I kept track of my free crypto and is now worth $637</summary>
              <div class="details-content">
                <p>&#x200B;
 Last month I started keeping track of my free Crypto. This is any crypto that I haven&#39;t personally bought.
 &#x200B;
 My methods:
 Coinbase Earn:
 You earn free crypto by watching a video explaining how a project works, and answer some questions about it, in return you receive between $1-$3 dollars for each one.
 In July 2020 I did majority of the Coinbase earn rewards, this was roughly $32 at the time, and is now $292 of my free crypto.

[Epistemic status: my current view, but I haven’t read all the stuff on this topic even in the LessWrong community, let alone more broadly.]
There is a line of thought that says that advanced AI will tend to be ‘goal-directed’—that is, consistently doing whatever makes certain favored outcomes more likely—and that this is to do with the ‘coherence arguments’. Rohin Shah, and probably others1, have argued against this. I want to argue against them.

I just finished Karen Pryor’s “Don’t Shoot the Dog: the New Art of Teaching and Training.” Partly because a friend points out that it’s not on Audible and therefore she can’t possibly read it, here are the notes I took and some thoughts. It’s a quick, easy read.
The book applies behavioral psychology to training animals and people. The author started off as a dolphin trainer at an aquarium park in the 1960s and moved on to horses, dogs, and her own children. There are…</p>

                <p>In 1913, 26-year-old Russian biologist Nikolai Vavilov went to the John Innes Horticultural Institute to study at the feet of legendary geneticist William Bateson. While there, Vavilov attended lectures at nearby Cambridge University, and could often be seen bicycling around the city in his trademark suit and tie. He and Bateson became lifelong friends, and the Mendelian genetics that Bateson and his team championed—and that remains the core of the field of genetics to this day—was burned into Vavilov’s sci…</p>

                <p>I grew up in a small village in a very rural part of England. It was a landscape capped with the huge skies of a low-lying coastal zone. Gently rolling fields, long hedgerows, and a lot of farms. Some of the people running those farms came from so many generations that they could point to the sites of their forebears’ land-working going back over four centuries. As a child it was fascinating to hear the farmers reflect on the profound changes wrought to that land and their little-concealed wonderment at the…</p>

This is a story where the alignment problem is somewhat harder than I expect, society handles AI more competently than I expect, and the outcome is worse than I expect. It also involves inner alignment turning out to be a surprisingly small problem. Maybe the story is 10-20th percentile on each of those axes. At the end I’m going to go through some salient ways you could vary the story.

To evaluate whether a competing theory to dark matter is plausible, it's important to know what the actual arguments in favor of dark matter are in more detail than just "dark matter is the stuff you have to add to get galactic rotation curves to work out".
