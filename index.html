              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Hi all! I was wondering how AI can be used to help individuals that are blind when they are using bank services (whether online or in person). I know there are some developments that can help people see, but I&#39;m not too sure of anything that can potentially help them when they are using a bank. Please let me know what types of things AI can do!

                <p>Everyone who is interested in NLP or even DL and ML for that matter, has definitely heard about the BERT family of models. BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT and many many more. This paper &quot;BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding&quot; first introduced this and it has now completely changed the way AI practitioners are solving and looking at NLP problems these days.
 As a part of my Paper Notes series, I have gone through the paper and created an informative summary of t…</p>

                <p>I m struggling to understand what is local search. More precisely, what is local search in the context of the Genetic Algorithm?
 If the local search is a way to find a &quot;better neighbor&quot;, can Mutation operator be seen as a local search since it usually creates only a small change in the solution.
 Also, in what ways can you implement local search to the Genetic algorithm (can it be implemented as a Selection, Crossover, Mutation or is it a new operator)?

                <p>I am trying to write a program in which an ai can detect whether a conversation is occurring or not. The ai does not need to transcribe words or have any meaning about the conversation, simply if one is occurring. A conversation can then simply be defined as having more than one speaker.
 Anyways, while searching for past research on the subject, I came across the field of speech diarization, which is where an AI is trained to distinguish the numbers of speakers in a conversation. This seems perfect to me, …</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>It seems to me like synthetic images is the way forward for training computer vision AI models.
 It has the following advantages:
  
No physical limitations. Some images in real life can be very expensive or even impossible to obtain in large amounts, like car crashes. Synthetic images however are only limited to the skill of the 3D artist.
 Less manpower intensive. Physical images need to be obtained and then annotated. Synthetic images can be generated in bulk easily, and the annotation process is automat…</p>

                <p>Reporting and Monitoring.
 There are two important types of tools in BI one is for reporting &amp; one is for real time monitoring.
 For reporting - Power BI, Tableau, Qlik Sense, Looker Etc.
 For real time monitoring i believe there a few categories based in what i have read in various articles.
 Cliff.ai - for real-time monitoring of business metrics.
 montecarlodata.com - for real time monitoring of data.
 What others tools for reporting &amp; real time monitoring tools you use or know about????

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>The courses at university teach me how to understand and build a model. However, we do not learn what to do with the model once it&#39;s done. Like how to put it into production for a company. I would like to understand this aspect a bit more.
 As I understand it, simple models can be saved and stored on a cloud server and accessed (through API) by the end application to make predictions based on new data. Is this realistic?
 How do you deploy models in your work environment?

 Does anyone have any advice?

 Especially after the memecoin hype the crypto community is shifting more and more towards a younger audience. Additionally, most people here likely have a very small amount of money invested, mainly those newbies. Not that this is a bad thing inherently, but if you are coming here for legitimate financial advice from seasoned investors you should be cautious of who is actually giving the advice.

 What is a market cap?
 People often get confused as to what a market cap actually is. It’s not how much wealth has been put into a coin. It’s simply how much you would get if you simultaneously liquidated all coins in existence. Will that ever happen? No, not even for scam coins as bag holders are part of th…</p>

 Previously known as Matic Network, Polygon is a framework for building interconnected blockchain networks.
 It seeks to address some of Ethereum&#39;s major limitations—including its throughput, poor user experience (high speed and delayed transactions), and lack of community governance—using a novel sidechain solution.
 Rather than being a simple scaling solution like its predecessor Matic Network—which uses a technology known as Plasma to process transactions off-chain before finalizing …</p>

525 LINK
 32 BNB
 22.7187 ETH
  
For a total value of $7750. Today it would have been worth $135 924. As a student, that would&#39;ve been quite life changing.

                <p>Get off that shitty app as soon as possible.
 Hopefully this DOGE implosion proves it&#39;s horrible to use and you don&#39;t actually own anything you buy off of their shitty app. It will crash every time something massive happens.
 Use a hardware wallet in the future so you actually control your crypto.
 Trezor and Ledger are amazing hardware wallets and there are many other hot software wallets online to use too.

 Why? Because the Elon being on SNL is priced in. It really doesn&#39;t matter what positives he says about doge because it was already expected. 
 Now I might be talking prematurely and doge could continue going back up since the show isn&#39;t over yet but it doesn&#39;t se…</p>

                <p>My friend Robert Burton, a neurologist and author, wanted to share a song with me last year, and sent me a link to an NPR Tiny Desk Concert. “It’s wonderful to see truly new and inspiring music,” he wrote. I clicked open the link to a band who appeared to have journeyed from their mountain village in Russia to busk for tourists in the city square. Three women wore long white wedding dresses, thick strands of bead necklaces, and Cossack hats that towered from their heads like minarets of black wool. They pla…</p>

                <p>In his Theaetetus, Plato remarks to Socrates: “This pathos is proper to the philosopher: It is the thaumazein. And philosophy has no other point of departure than this.” The word, which contains the root thauma, the same that appears in thaumaturgy, has often been translated as “wonder.” Philosophy is born out of amazement mixed with the curiosity that arises from facing something inexplicable that fascinates and transcends us. Aristotle writes explicitly that, beginning by asking the simplest questions, hu…</p>

                <p>Many marine biologists identify a gateway drug into their obsession, and for Heather Koldewey, it was the seahorse. Who can blame her? Seahorses seem to have evolved not entirely in the ocean, but also by way of a whimsical storybook, in which animal body parts are all mixed up. A fish with the head of a horse? A male that gets pregnant, gives birth, and is monogamous?
Seahorses led her not only to her career as the head of marine and freshwater conservation at the London Zoological Society, but to her effo…</p>

[Epistemic status: my current view, but I haven’t read all the stuff on this topic even in the LessWrong community, let alone more broadly.]
There is a line of thought that says that advanced AI will tend to be ‘goal-directed’—that is, consistently doing whatever makes certain favored outcomes more likely—and that this is to do with the ‘coherence arguments’. Rohin Shah, and probably others1, have argued against this. I want to argue against them.

                <p>In 2001, Seth MacFarlane was the 27-year-old executive producer and creator of the not-yet-hit animated show Family Guy. Having broken into the entertainment big leagues at such a young age, MacFarlane was invited back in September to address his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design. After giving a talk, he went out for what turned out to be a late night of drinking with some professors. 
The next morning, September 11, MacFarlane raced to catch an 8:15 a.m. flight out of Boston back to Los Angeles…</p>

                <p>In 1913, 26-year-old Russian biologist Nikolai Vavilov went to the John Innes Horticultural Institute to study at the feet of legendary geneticist William Bateson. While there, Vavilov attended lectures at nearby Cambridge University, and could often be seen bicycling around the city in his trademark suit and tie. He and Bateson became lifelong friends, and the Mendelian genetics that Bateson and his team championed—and that remains the core of the field of genetics to this day—was burned into Vavilov’s sci…</p>

                <p>I grew up in a small village in a very rural part of England. It was a landscape capped with the huge skies of a low-lying coastal zone. Gently rolling fields, long hedgerows, and a lot of farms. Some of the people running those farms came from so many generations that they could point to the sites of their forebears’ land-working going back over four centuries.

This is a story where the alignment problem is somewhat harder than I expect, society handles AI more competently than I expect, and the outcome is worse than I expect. It also involves inner alignment turning out to be a surprisingly small problem. Maybe the story is 10-20th percentile on each of those axes. At the end I’m going to go through some salient ways you could vary the story.
