                      <span>To everyone wondering, dip happened at the same time the stock market closed. And it was bleeding today.
 It’s just whales making up for their loss, preparing their bags to invest in stocks that just dipped, pumping it back up and putting that money again in cryptos.
 It’s alright, discount for us

 Was very happy, a lot of stuff up, nice profits, etc.
 Checks on fear/greed index &gt; above 70 &gt; well probably sometime this week bear may strike again.
 Time to go to work.
 Checks again, everything red and dropping almost 10%.

 Have luck and good fun people

What they are and how you can avoid them.&quot; Since then I got a lot of messages from people asking me how they can tell the difference between a new coin with lots of potential and a shitcoin. For maximum protection, make sure you follow this guide in combination with the other guide. I will not repeat those rules here.

SHIB is an experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building. SHIB token is our first token and allows users to hold Billions or even Trillions of them. Nicknamed the DOGECOIN KILLER, this ERC-20 ONLY token can remain well under a penny and still outpace Dogecoin in a small amount of time (relatively speaking).

                      <span>I wrote this originally for the Coinbase subreddit since I saw so many people getting their account hacked. If you have over $10k on an exchange or any amount you can&#39;t afford to lose, do ALL of these steps. To be honest, all of this is just the bare minimum. I&#39;ve been trading and using cryptocurrency since 2017, I work in IT and have taken classes in cybersecurity. I am nowhere near an expert but I feel that I know a lot about this. Feel free to add anything I missed below.

                      <span>This {coin_name} is really undervalue and so cheap. Buy {coin_name} because this coin in the future of crypto. It has only low {float_value} will extremely grow {percentage * 100}% soon. {coin_name} has a great use with the blockchain and it&#39;s still so cheap... it&#39;s an amazing bargain, really undervalued 🙏🎉👍💰 {coin_name} to the moon 🚀

                      <span>I&#39;m gonna go straight to the point, I thought this bullrun would last until autumn of 2021, but seeing the shitcoin situation right now is really starting to scare me. The shib token just hit 10B marketcap and went completely parabolic like what you&#39;d see at the end of the bullrun. I&#39;m starting to think the whole market might come crashing down way sooner than people expect if this kind of thing is already happening. I mean the coin has absolutely no use case and started as a copy of doge (which…</span>

 I make a dime 
 That&#39;s why I mine on company time.
 And they think the bill is high because of the air conditioning 
 I also spend 1/3 of the time browsing Reddit and watching the charts but that&#39;s none of their business...

                      <span>The dead cat bounce is a coin/stock that sharply declines, usually after a good run up (hello Doge), then seems to make a sudden, sometimes dramatic recovery only to plummet again shortly afterwards. This can continue for a few cycles until the floor is hit, figuratively speaking.
 If you want an example, go look at the BTC price chart from December 1st 2017 to the middle of 2018. In that relatively shory period of time BTC reached it’s the then-ATH of $19.000 dollar before bouncing down to lows of around $…</span>

 I can search online for top universities but the reason I ask here to get your advice about the ones with no differences between online and onsite certificate.

                      <span>Hi,
 I&#39;m thinking about exploring DS in the freelance world. I have started working full time in January, but the position is not very challenging or time consuming and I need more projects. I&#39;m wondering if anyone out there has any experience as a freelancer, consultant, or part-time and what your tips are to be successful? 
 Thanks!

                      <span>I&#39;m a &quot;data scientist&quot; that does data engineering. I get data science interviews from my job title alone. Does anyone else think data science is too broad of a field to ever feel prepared for the interview. For example, I feel data science jobs can be broken down into the following types of roles:
 1) The typical data scientist: This is what we typically how we imagine a data scientist. The role involves a bit of data exploration, ML model building, presentations to management, etc.

                      <span>Is there a reddit for data science that isnt focused on career questions? I&#39;m on r/statistics but I didnt know if there was a similar home for DS specifically.
 EDIT: and would anyone else be interested in seeing this sub be more than a flood of career entering and movement threads? If that&#39;s what is wanted great, but I&#39;ve always thought that most of the content in this sub could be contained in a single pinned thread.

                      <span>If you read posts/comments from this sub, people are quite assertive that their path is the main path. They say get a masters/PhD in “ “ and that’s the only way in. They say don’t get a masters in analytics/data science but encourage the analytics @ Georgia Tech. Worry about your own goals and domains that you want to get into and focus YOUR path for that. There’s data scientist from a million different backgrounds and educational levels.

The thorny thought experiment has been turned into a real experiment — one that physicists use to probe the physics of information.Illustration by Samuel Velasco / Quanta Magazine
The universe bets on disorder. Imagine, for example, dropping a thimbleful of red dye into a swimming pool. All of those dye molecules are going to slowly spread throughout the water.
Physicists quantify this tendency to spread by counting the number of possible w…</span>

                      <span>My friend Robert Burton, a neurologist and author, wanted to share a song with me last year, and sent me a link to an NPR Tiny Desk Concert. “It’s wonderful to see truly new and inspiring music,” he wrote. I clicked open the link to a band who appeared to have journeyed from their mountain village in Russia to busk for tourists in the city square. Three women wore long white wedding dresses, thick strands of bead necklaces, and Cossack hats that towered from their heads like minarets of black wool. They pla…</span>

                      <span>In his Theaetetus, Plato remarks to Socrates: “This pathos is proper to the philosopher: It is the thaumazein. And philosophy has no other point of departure than this.” The word, which contains the root thauma, the same that appears in thaumaturgy, has often been translated as “wonder.” Philosophy is born out of amazement mixed with the curiosity that arises from facing something inexplicable that fascinates and transcends us. Aristotle writes explicitly that, beginning by asking the simplest questions, hu…</span>

                      <span>Many marine biologists identify a gateway drug into their obsession, and for Heather Koldewey, it was the seahorse. Who can blame her? Seahorses seem to have evolved not entirely in the ocean, but also by way of a whimsical storybook, in which animal body parts are all mixed up. A fish with the head of a horse? A male that gets pregnant, gives birth, and is monogamous?
Seahorses led her not only to her career as the head of marine and freshwater conservation at the London Zoological Society, but to her effo…</span>

[Epistemic status: my current view, but I haven’t read all the stuff on this topic even in the LessWrong community, let alone more broadly.]
There is a line of thought that says that advanced AI will tend to be ‘goal-directed’—that is, consistently doing whatever makes certain favored outcomes more likely—and that this is to do with the ‘coherence arguments’. Rohin Shah, and probably others1, have argued against this. I want to argue against them.

After giving a talk, he went out for what turned out to be a late night of drinking with some professors.

This is a story where the alignment problem is somewhat harder than I expect, society handles AI more competently than I expect, and the outcome is worse than I expect. It also involves inner alignment turning out to be a surprisingly small problem. Maybe the story is 10-20th percentile on each of those axes. At the end I’m going to go through some salient ways you could vary the story.

Known simply as “her,” she would become the star of My Octopus Teacher, the Oscar-nominated Netflix documentary and surprise pandemic hit that told the story of Foster’s unlikely relationship with that eight-armed mollusk.

                      <span>Like most American high school students, I was required to take Chemistry and English. Chemistry thrilled only by way of the absurdity of allowing kids like me to play with volatile compounds and an open flame. English provided little of that thrill save, perhaps, Holden Caulfield’s excessive swearing or Huckleberry Finn’s audacity in heading down the big river after faking his own death.

                      <span>It might surprise you to find out how little evidence there is to support the idea that boosting students’ “grit”—their propensity to tenaciously attack difficult problems they encounter rather than give up—is a reliably effective way to improve their school performance or to close long-standing education gaps. After all, you’ve probably heard otherwise. Grit is everywhere. By the time you read this, it will have been a golden child of the world of education for well over a decade. It’s a sexy, appealing id…</span>

Most problems can be separated pretty cleanly into two categories: things we basically understand, and things we basically don’t understand.
