                              <span>I’m curious to know what the consensus on best online master’s in data science is? I am a little less price dependent as my company would cover $30k or so.
 The 3 I keep seeing as being rated pretty well are Georgia Tech, Texas, and Illinois.
 Is this accurate?
 Would love to hear where different people went, how the program was, and roughly how much time they spent per class per week.
 Thank you so much in advance!

                              <span>I’ve been working as an applied ML engineer for almost a decade now, and in recent years I find I’m spending a lot less time fiddling with model architectures and a lot more time digging into the data - rebalancing the data, removing bad labels, figuring out features we should add, and sourcing new labeled examples of cases where the model is weak.
 Often I’ve found this means collaborating with less-technical folks (e.g. PMs, managers, annotators, data domain experts, etc.) on the team to dig through individual examples in our training set. While the engineers and data scientists on the team are usually comfortable looking at examples in a Python notebook environment, with the non-technical folks, I often need to screen-share my notebook with them, or we hack together a Google spreadsheet…</span>

                              <span>I did my undergrad in IR and Russian. That said, I also took coding courses in Python in high school and did some basic data analysis courses in college + systems engineering. I’m possibly looking to do a Masters in Data Science. Would it be a pipe dream to start down this path? I actually really like working with data and I love the work/life balance that the profession offers. Would you guys have any advice?

However, it is overwhelming to give focus to both + work full time, so I need help deciding how to split my time, or if I should split my time at all. 
 How should I split my time between MS courses and self studying the modern data technologies and frameworks being used in the real world?

                              <span>Hey guys so I&#x27;m a month in at my new job as a data engineer. There are so many initiatives and so much data. I&#x27;m very new to this kind of thing to be honest with you and was hired for my general knowledge of key databases and some coding skills that I just kind of picked up at my previous role at the same company. So we are running this model in sas and they already put me in charge of data governance. I have meetings with our consultants but I basically need to drive them and ensure they are doing what they are supposed to be doing. 
 So I guess my question is what should I be focusing on? What are the typical key metrics that you use to validate the model, the input output data? What can I do to be successful at this? 
 It&#x27;s a lot of new info so very overwhelming, any help is very appreciated. 
 Thank youu!!!!

                              <span>I’ve recently started at a new company in a hybrid DS/engineering role. It’s an older company in the utility industry, so there’s a pretty healthy mix of “traditional” &amp; modern ways of keeping track of things (events, equipment, project status, etc). Thankfully we do have some Oracle DBs in place that a couple members on the team are using to build new dashboards and analytics scripts from. However, lots of existing/historical work tracking is done through random Excel sheets scattered about the network drives. There always exists a desire to move forward and advance our current practices to increase effectiveness &amp; efficiency within the company’s data handling schemes. 
 We can develop new scripts/dashboards and do all kinds of cool stuff on that side of things. I’m just curious as to what methods other people may be using to bridge gaps between scattered Excel data/reporting sheets and more centralized dashboarding/SW development practices. 
 If you couldn’t tell, I’m a bit new the DS working side. I’ve done lots with Python, SQL, and a few dashboard platforms, but I’m still new to the real world applications of DS. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am graduating in May 2023 with an MS in Business Analytics from a very high-ranking university but I have been unable to land an interview.
 Context:
 -I am an international student in the US who is switching from a network engineer to hopefully a Data Analyst/ Business Analyst role
 My concerns:
 -Do the &quot;objective&quot; section and projects before the work-ex section look okay? Google said I need these for my career switch.
 -Are my projects impactful?
 - What other technical skills can I learn and add?
 - Will my previous designation negatively impact my chances?

Have you done anything similar that you can recommend?

 Would anyone like to give a realistic run down of what a typical day looks like for you working in data science? 
 Also, is data science similar to computer science in the aspect that you don’t need a degree just need to know your stuff to secure a job? (Unlike the translational side of science, degree means everything🙃) 
 Thanks in advance!

 My question is: in Linear Regression (LR), if I have (say)10 features then my LR looks like this y&#x3D;c1x1+c2x2+.....+ c10x10. If I reduce my features to (say) 2 components then my LR looks like y&#x3D;C1PC1+C2PC2 (where C &#x3D; constant &amp; PC &#x3D; principle components).
 how is this equation useful to me because now my y is represented in terms of Principle components (PC) instead of actual variables. 
 I haven&#x27;t been able to find this answer online. Please help.

                              <span>Ever wondered how Tesla&#x27;s autopilot is able to make so many predictions in real time? It&#x27;s because instead of 
 designing multiple neural networks for different tasks, they design neural networks with a common backbone 
 doing multiple tasks. These neural networks are called Hydranets. Having known about them I revived
 my old project on a self-driving car and designed a hydranet for predicting both the steering angle and throttle
 in a single pass. To know more you can visit this blog link:

 ​
 There is also a youtube link in the blog which shows the working of the system in real time.

                              <span>Hallo! 
 I am currently deciding on my master thesis, enrolled in Computer Science focusing on Big Data and AI. Based out of Berlin, Germany.
 I use Python as my scripting language, versed with Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, Seaborn, matplotlib, Understand machine learning models in theory and regression and classification models in practice. I also have basic understanding of DB and can use SQL in practice.
 I still haven&#x27;t found a field that I really want to work in. Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is interesting as I had done a mini project earlier. Given the time frame, I have to submit a thesis proposal in 2 weeks. I am researching and reading up on papers but I would like to work on my Master thesis with a company as I want to be exposed to real work environment as well. I lack guidance and direction, and working under someone would not only be beneficial for me, but would also give me a second supervisor that my University mandates.
 Can someone help me out with this? I&#x27;ll be happy to share my resume and hold further talks regarding the same. I can be an asset to any team and good with research work. I am seeking a topics under companies as I am open to work in different fields.
 Time is crucial and scarce right now.

The other one is a fulltime BI dev role in insurance (will learn some ETL during). Downside here is that there will be no building data models. Just sql and BI. This will be my first job in the field. Which one will be better in the long run? Thank you

Spamming the algorithm&#x27;s API with random data inputs
 Recording what you put in and what the algorithm spat out
 Training your own algorithm using that data
  
Would it only become illegal if I tried to sell such an algorithm?
 I have no intention to do this, but interesting thought experiment

However, the reasons for choosing treatment A over treatment B are opaque and differ from case to case so there are no obvious set of covariates. We do have a hunch of which attributes have a say in treatment selection so we have created a dataset containing ~ 40 covariates. Half-decent model can be built using these to predict whether observation X gets treatment A or B so propensity scores are a good and possible option. 
 I don&#x27;t have a lot of data so I prefer to use methods which don&#x27;t lose data (so no CEM matching for example) 
 Here comes my question: can I just opportunistically try a whole bunch of different covariate balancing schemes and just pick the one which seems to produce the best results, eg most balanced data set? Or should I first try to narrow down the set of covariates on which the balance is desired? (balancing a covariate which is in no way related to getting treatment is moot). When different schemes might produce even quite wildly different estimates, how to gauge which is the most plausible one? 
 I do know that treatment A produces better results than treatment B, both data and theory support it. Now just to find the most plausible estimate on exactly how much and to be able to defend my choises :p

                              <span>Hello! I was directed here from NoStupidQuestions after posting this there. I tried googling it but I have no earthly idea how to phrase it.
 Say I&#x27;m running a factory that processes many different ingredients to make different products, but using the same processes (and therefore machines) to create them. Furthermore, some of the products are used as ingredients for other products. Is there a program or algorithm I can use to determine the best location to put each machine and each source for each ingredient to minimize conveyor belts, etc. needed (or travel distance for each ingredient, in other words)?

                              <span>Hey all, I am in need of help from the Reddit hive mind! A while back (probably over a year ago) I found a resource put together by an AI researcher/academic, that outlined a self-study curriculum for learning the foundations of AI. It was a fairly barebones/old school web page, that outlined a sequential curriculum you could use on your own to get up to speed. If I remember correctly it was quite in depth, in that it was laid out to match a typical 4-year undergraduate degree. I&#x27;m super interested in finding it again, but unfortunately my Googling skills seem to be lacking. If anyone knows what I&#x27;m babbling about and has any ideas, that would be of massive help! Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Ever wondered how Tesla&#x27;s autopilot is able to make so many predictions in real time? It&#x27;s because instead of 
 designing multiple neural networks for different tasks, they design neural networks with a common backbone 
 doing multiple tasks. These neural networks are called Hydranets. Having known about them I revived
 my old project on a self-driving car and designed a hydranet for predicting both the steering angle and throttle
 in a single pass. To know more you can visit this blog link:

 https://medium.com/geekculture/building-a-hydranet-for-self-driving-car-simulation-cd08543feffe
 ​
 There is also a youtube link in the blog which shows the working of the system in real time.

 - ai generated logos: https://brandmark.io/ 
 - ai image generation of course: https://playgroundai.com/ 
 - written documents: lex.page 
 is there anything for Ai generated deepfake influencers? 😝 
 What are some other cool ai tools oyu guys have found? (besides dalle image generators)

                              <span>What is this process called? I remember it being discussed on this sub a long time ago but I can’t find anything on it. Lets say for example that I have multiple low resolution cameras that gave me 10000 images of some area from different angles. How would I go about combining all those pictures to produce a single high quality picture of this area? 
 Any input is appreciated

                              <span>Have been trying to find a github repo that offers similar functionality.
 For those that aren&#x27;t familiar, it takes an image with a face and will nicely animate that photo (head movements, blinking). Unfortunately after 2 videos they want you to pay 200 dollars for a year of their service. While I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying for this feature alone for a cheaper price, unfortunately most of the other features in the package are of no interest or value to me. 
 I have tried to achieve this effect manually when Adobe After Effects, learning about displacement maps and making one in photoshop, but I wasn&#x27;t able to get great results, and it was kind of hard to do for many images :(
 Thank you so much!

                              <span>I am a rapper (not one of any importance) and I am interested in someday being able to make AI-generated songs out of my existing pool of lyrics/recordings, and I’m hoping that someone here might be able to point me in the right direction where to start.
 Admittedly, I have zero understanding or experience with AI or code or anything, but I want to start organizing the data that I do have, like lyrics, acapellas, and instrumentals.
 The way I envision it, I would run all of my lyrics through a word-counter of some kind to come up with my full vocabulary and track that on a doc or spreadsheet, and I would have folders with wav files of all of my acapellas, which I would re-record all on the same microphone to have a uniform sound. 
 Would it be in my best interest to have separate wav files for each individual word if I could snip them from the acapellas? Or would that be a waste of my time? 
 I really am just trying to get my foot in the door here so I would love to hear any suggestions that anyone has for reading material, video tutorials or existing tools that I should research to get started.
