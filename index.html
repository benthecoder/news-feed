              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Has anyone ever come across the &quot;stochastic block model&quot; (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_block_model)? All in all, this seems like a community detection algorithm for graphs (i.e. network clustering). 
 Does anyone know in which circumstances it would make more sense to use &quot;stochastic block models&quot; compared to community detection algorithms such as &quot;louvain clustering&quot;?
 Until now, I had only approached this problem from a classical &quot;community detection&quot; …</p>

                <p>I&#39;ve been struggling to find a data science internship program or just internships in general because most of the time it&#39;s asking for someone who has their Masters or is getting their Masters. Does anyone know of any undergrad data science internship opportunities?

 That&#39;s my situation at least....so how do I know how I&#39;m doing?
  
Comparing to kaggle is fine, but honestly most notebooks on kaggle are quite poor quality (and even the better ones are more CS focused than deep thorough analysis)

 Using toPandas() is really not always an option and it is just very time-consuming.
 Do you have other dirty tricks like sampling some rows and using toPandas afterwards? Or are you just looking at plain describe statistics like quantiles, mean, max etc?
 For example, vaex has a special viz library built in that allows to use the leverage the vaex aggregatio…</p>

                <p>I&#39;m putting together an ARIMA-based forecasting tool for materials consumption.
 My problem is that manufacturing was hot hard by shortages in 2020, and so there&#39;s a huge anomalous dip in production (and thus consumption) last spring.
 The rest of the year is mostly normal, but those abnormal months are having an outsized impact on the seasonal trend.
 If you were me, how would you massage the data so as to mitigate the effect of something outside the norm like this?

 However, this probably would not scale and we already have situations where the RAM runs out and we run code overnight to get some results.

 Context: I’m looking to organize the text datasets that we have at where I work. Right now it’s a bit all over the place depending on the data source: BigQuery, PostgreSQL (there are reasons why we have two separate dbs but I won’t get into that), Google Sheets, csvs, etc. Besides of labeled datasets, we also have many dictionaries that we use to build simple rules.

                <p>As rising global temperatures eat away at the planet’s glaciers, rivers are physically changing their course. The resulting “river piracy,” as it’s called, risks leaving communities and natural ecosystems without the sources of water they’ve evolved around or otherwise rely on, according to The Guardian. And while most instances of river piracy are […]

 At the same time, Bitcoin dominance has just dropped below 50%, which hasn&#39;t happened since June 2018. 
 This is history in the making. Please, sit back and think about it.

                <p>Recently my friend tried to send money (several times) from his HSBC account to binance and it was blocked. 
 It turns out HSBC doesn&#39;t allow payments for cryptocurrencies. They also banned buying microstrategy stocks. 
 I&#39;m so shocked they have the audacity to do this! Surely this solidifies and shows the importance of decentralisation in crypto.
 I also found out ironically that they helped money launder for drug cartels in Mexico. 
 If you are still using this awful bank please do yourself a favo…</p>

The device itself generates that seed when you initialize it. If it already exists, then someone has a copy of it.
 This is a 3-4 year old scam that is just coming back around BIG TIME with the influx in new crypto investors. Stay safe out there!

                <p>Posts showing how much you would have made had you only invested early are dwelling on the past. We cannot go back in time and cast our lottery numbers based on what we know today.
 Instead, come up with a longterm strategy. Many assets appreciate over time. Pick a strategy and then stick to it. Evaluate after a year. And most importantly, don’t invest more than what you can afford to lose.

I just finished Karen Pryor’s “Don’t Shoot the Dog: the New Art of Teaching and Training.” Partly because a friend points out that it’s not on Audible and therefore she can’t possibly read it, here are the notes I took and some thoughts. It’s a quick, easy read.
The book applies behavioral psychology to training animals and people. The author started off as a dolphin trainer at an aquarium park in the 1960s and moved on to horses, dogs, and her own children. There are…</p>

                <p>In 2001, Seth MacFarlane was the 27-year-old executive producer and creator of the not-yet-hit animated show Family Guy. Having broken into the entertainment big leagues at such a young age, MacFarlane was invited back in September to address his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design. After giving a talk, he went out for what turned out to be a late night of drinking with some professors. 
The next morning, September 11, MacFarlane raced to catch an 8:15 a.m. flight out of Boston back to Los Angeles…</p>

                <p>In 1913, 26-year-old Russian biologist Nikolai Vavilov went to the John Innes Horticultural Institute to study at the feet of legendary geneticist William Bateson. While there, Vavilov attended lectures at nearby Cambridge University, and could often be seen bicycling around the city in his trademark suit and tie. He and Bateson became lifelong friends, and the Mendelian genetics that Bateson and his team championed—and that remains the core of the field of genetics to this day—was burned into Vavilov’s sci…</p>

                <p>I grew up in a small village in a very rural part of England. It was a landscape capped with the huge skies of a low-lying coastal zone. Gently rolling fields, long hedgerows, and a lot of farms. Some of the people running those farms came from so many generations that they could point to the sites of their forebears’ land-working going back over four centuries. As a child it was fascinating to hear the farmers reflect on the profound changes wrought to that land and their little-concealed wonderment at the…</p>

This is a story where the alignment problem is somewhat harder than I expect, society handles AI more competently than I expect, and the outcome is worse than I expect. It also involves inner alignment turning out to be a surprisingly small problem. Maybe the story is 10-20th percentile on each of those axes. At the end I’m going to go through some salient ways you could vary the story.

Most problems can be separated pretty cleanly into two categories: things we basically understand, and things we basically don’t understand. Some things we basically understand: building bridges and skyscrapers, treating and preventing infections, satellites and GPS, cars and ships, oil wells and gas pipelines and power plants, cell networks and databases and websites. Some things we basically don’t understand: building fusion power plants, treating and preventing c…</p>

I'm here to tell you a story about what it was like to be a rationalist decades before the Sequences and the formation of the modern rationalist community. &nbsp;It is not the only story that could be told, but it is one that runs parallel to and has important connections to Eliezer Yudkowsky's and how his ideas developed.
My goal in writing this essay is to give the LW community a sense of the prehistory of their movement. &nbsp;It is not intended to be "where Eliez…</p>

There’s also a pecking order within each of these disciplines. Take biology, for example: Geneticists are superior to Biochemists, who are superior to Ecologists.

This post will be about the main points of evidence for the existence of dark matter. To evaluate whether a competing theory to dark matter is plausible, it's important to know what the actual arguments in favor of dark matter are in more detail than just "dark matter is the stuff you have to add to get galactic rotation curves to work out". A competitor has to address the strongest arguments in favor of the existence of dark matter, not just the weaker fare like ga…</p>
