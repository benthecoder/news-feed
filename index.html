                              <span>Basically, what the title says.
 ​
 Let&#x27;s say we are doing an AB Test on two segments of customers. Segment (variation and segment are used interchangeably) A and B.
 We need to have a sample size of 8K per variation. 
 We run our test and in the end we realize that there are 500 customers in segment/ variation A have moved to variation B and 500 customers from variation B have moved to variation A. 
 ​
 Now you want to analyze the data. What would you do with these 1K customers? 
 ​
 It depends on the type of hypothesis that we have. Let&#x27;s say we want to measure the changes in customer behavior (if the segments are about loyalty, are customers moving between these segments or not?), then I would say this movement between categories is what I need to have. Otherwise, for instance, when I want to see what is happening to an attribute to certain types of customers, I would remove those 1K customers from both parts. 
 ​
 Is this a correct answer? If not, what&#x27;s yours?

 Please, if you have any information or advice or you have gone through the same situation, feel free to post it.

                              <span>I have two datasets, one about Airbnb listings and the other about Pokemon. The struggle is coming up with &#x27;client&#x27; questions to answer with analysis and visualization. At my job it&#x27;s pretty clear where I can add value based on a gazillion insights we&#x27;re not using yet, but out here with all the freedom, I can&#x27;t seem to think of questions that are really worth answering.
 Is there something like a top 10 that is highly valuable, regardless of topic and assuming the data is there (or can be calculated)?
 I&#x27;m pretty sure nobody is impressed by having a visual with Top N and Bottom N, the highest concentration of hosts in a single city on global, or the most occurring Pokemon type :D
 How do you usually come up with questions on non-work-related topics?

                              <span>I (29yr) have been managing a farm for 6 years and about to resign. Currently making 150k/year and am ok without income for quite some time. Just feel like I have a lot of skills that I&#x27;m not using and ready for a career change. I&#x27;m interested in finance, math (extremely good in it and won multiple national math olympics awards) and programming. I was thinking either software engineering or data science could be interesting but open to any other ideas. What would you recommend?

 (I would probably choose big data and data analytics if I had to make a choice right now.)

                              <span>Suppose we have a solid ML model lifecycle setup that includes a pipeline covering everything from data ingestion/transformations to model building to model comparisons/eval to model monitoring, which in turn has the ability to kick off a model refresh that becomes a “challenger” candidate to replace the currently deployed model. Further, suppose the cost of running this pipeline is negligible (highly automated and low enough compute/time cost that we can run it every day without concern if we wanted to).
 Does model monitoring become an unnecessary “middle man” in this situation?
 I can think of 2 reasons we might still want model monitoring in this situation: 1. Statistics without logic is bad and model monitoring provides the logic behind building a challenger model 2. Model monitoring provides details about the drift that occurred, which may be valuable to understand for future analysis, feature engineering, etc

All free sources seem to stop at 2019 and the rest are behind a big pay-wall. Any help getting to such data would be greatly appreciated 🙏
 So far I’m thinking about data related to country expenditure, incoming/outgoing travel, pollution levels, un/employment rates etc, anything would do really as long as I can link them together in a daily/monthly timeline

                              <span>I see a lot of comments promoting online masters vs a conventional masters degree due to it costing like 10k. However what is the trade off? I mean most masters degree cost around 50k for a good school so whats the catch? The same school prices their in-person masters degree significantly higher. 
 I only have networking as trade off in mind but cant think of anything else. If online masters is that good then why in the world would people put themselves in debt and going in person for masters in stats or Ds when they can pay a fraction of the price and make the same amount of money?

                              <span>Software sales guy here. Just started learning statistics and python. 
 Got curious. 
 Anyone here who successfully transitioned from a non-IT/no coding background to a data scientist role? 
 If yes, how&#x27;d you do it? How long did it take? 
 and any pointers are much appreciated.

                              <span>Using unique and personal phrases /sentence structures and words: This is probably the most effective technique to make your text bypass any AI detector. Just add some words here and there, reword a few words to your liking. This works because the words you put in, instead of the words generated by ChatGPT, throws off the AI detector leading it to believe the text is most likely human as it is unpredictable by its own standards. (Examples plus even more ways to do this are given in the following post, be sure to read the whole thing to effectively bypass any AI detection system!)
