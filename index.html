I had an phone interview over the phone and the job is way, WAY over my head. I don&#39;t know Python much, just basic syntax and slight use of Pandas, yet they want me to be able to code there. I meet the SQL requirements for sure, however.
 The recruiter over the phone did not sound confident when I told her I did not expect Python to be used so heavily per the job description. I also told her…</p>

I understand many of those people are just doing a playful banter but there were serious posts like &quot;I&#39;m depressed because I earn only 320k/year and my friends earn way more than me&quot;.

 I am the CMO of an ecommerce company and have a Shopify store. I have been working towards improving the way I go about presenting in our weekly advertising meetings. In the past I&#39;ve listed out campaigns, the performance of key metrics, sales attributed from each platforms and then discussed budget based on the performance.

                <p>Python is really an easy programming language and a lot of people claim to know. So I am thinking about if it&#39;s a good investment of time and efforts to learn Python, or I should try Software Engineering with JVM. C, or some other CS field.

                <p>So I landed a new job and one of the perks is that I will be able to hire an analyst to serve underneath me. 
 The position is for a &quot;Senior Research Analyst&quot; and the salary budget is 65K. That seems a tad low for a senior analyst position in Salt Lake City given cost of living. Granted the benefits and work/life balance are really good. Also, based on what I&#39;ve seen so far, the position is more of a reporting analyst than a research analyst.

 For example here is an example I just made up relating to Supervised NLP (Natural Language Processing) Classification : Suppose I have 1000 medical reports of patients, containing unstructured text made by a doctor during a hospital visit.

                <p>So I’ve introduced crypto to my mom by helping her making a Coinbase account and get the free rewards. 
 A few weeks later, she decided to invest in it but she only buy the coins with logos that she likes. I tried to explain to her that’s not really how it works but you know, moms can be pretty stubborn so I let her do her thing. 
 Here’s her rating of the top 10 coins based on their logo
 1 - BTC
 Pretty basic, she likes the orange color but it could be done by a 12yo on paint with windows 98.

                <p>People often gift newcomers with the sage advice of &quot;Never invest more than you can afford to lose&quot; and that advice is still as important as it has ever been.
 However, I do not believe the advice goes far enough, because it doesn&#39;t account for the highly addictive nature of crypto. Once you start earning, you never want to stop, and although the value of our portfolios might rise to the heavens, most of us will probably die long before we beat the addiction and actually spend our gains.

                <p>My friend Robert Burton, a neurologist and author, wanted to share a song with me last year, and sent me a link to an NPR Tiny Desk Concert. “It’s wonderful to see truly new and inspiring music,” he wrote. I clicked open the link to a band who appeared to have journeyed from their mountain village in Russia to busk for tourists in the city square.

And philosophy has no other point of departure than this.” The word, which contains the root thauma, the same that appears in thaumaturgy, has often been translated as “wonder.” Philosophy is born out of amazement mixed with the curiosity that arises from facing something inexplicable that fascinates and transcends us.

Seahorses seem to have evolved not entirely in the ocean, but also by way of a whimsical storybook, in which animal body parts are all mixed up. A fish with the head of a horse? A male that gets pregnant, gives birth, and is monogamous?

[Epistemic status: my current view, but I haven’t read all the stuff on this topic even in the LessWrong community, let alone more broadly.]
There is a line of thought that says that advanced AI will tend to be ‘goal-directed’—that is, consistently doing whatever makes certain favored outcomes more likely—and that this is to do with the ‘coherence arguments’.

I just finished Karen Pryor’s “Don’t Shoot the Dog: the New Art of Teaching and Training.” Partly because a friend points out that it’s not on Audible and therefore she can’t possibly read it, here are the notes I took and some thoughts. It’s a quick, easy read.

After giving a talk, he went out for what turned out to be a late night of drinking with some professors.

This is a story where the alignment problem is somewhat harder than I expect, society handles AI more competently than I expect, and the outcome is worse than I expect. It also involves inner alignment turning out to be a surprisingly small problem. Maybe the story is 10-20th percentile on each of those axes. At the end I’m going to go through some salient ways you could vary the story.

On April 1, Eliezer Yudkowsky ran a dath ilan AMA on Facebook:

I came from a parallel Earth that successfully coordinated around maintaining a higher level of ability to solve coordination problems.&nbsp;Ask me anything.
