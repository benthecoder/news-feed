 Maybe in the future this will change the time we spend at a bear market because not everything&#39;s tanking at the same time.

                <p>IBM and ETH Zurich researchers make progress in reconciling neurophysiological insights with machine intelligence, proposing a novel biologically inspired optimizer for artificial (ANNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs) that incorporates synaptic integration principles from biology. GRAPES (Group Responsibility for Adjusting the Propagation of Error Signals) leads to improvements in the training time convergence, accuracy and scalability of ANNs and SNNs.

              <summary>Unpopular opinion: These price prediction polls are just as bad as Meme Weekends</summary>
              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Idk if its just me - but does anyone else feel the same?
 These polls add nothing of value to the discussion but are still taking up the entire front page in place of quality content - I&#39;m getting serious flashbacks to when Moon farmers kept spamming memes the sub every weekend with the same recycled memes.
 Maybe these things could belong to a different sub and just be linked through a single post instead?

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>TIL that changing the order of features when calling the fit method of sklearn random forest regressor can lead to a different model, even if the seed and random_state is the same.
 For ex: 
  
Function call 1: RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42).fit(dataframe1[[feat1,feat2,feat3]])
 Function call 2: RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42).fit(dataframe1[[feat3,feat2,feat1]])
  
The models you will get from the above two functions will be different! This could be down to the random nature of the algorithm…</p>

 Suppose you 50 years of data about hospital visits. You are interested in supervised classification. You have predictors such as age, height, weight, blood type, salary, etc. You are interested in predicting if the hospital stay will be less than 1 day or more than 1 day. This can be easily solved using random forest.
 My dilemma is: using all 50 years of data might be able to capture a wide variety of patter…</p>

[Epistemic status: my current view, but I haven’t read all the stuff on this topic even in the LessWrong community, let alone more broadly.]
There is a line of thought that says that advanced AI will tend to be ‘goal-directed’—that is, consistently doing whatever makes certain favored outcomes more likely—and that this is to do with the ‘coherence arguments’. Rohin Shah, and probably others1, have argued against this. I want to argue against them.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Recently, the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office has published a patent application from Apple labeled “Interpretable Neural Networks for Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation.”
 Studies show that 1 in 3 deaths in the United States is caused due to heart disease and stroke. It is observed that high blood pressure (HBP) is associated with specific cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors which vary in proportion from one environment to another. Yet, high blood pressure generally has no warning signs or symptoms,…</p>

 Paying fees twice is worth the peace of mind. If you&#39;re sending a small amount and it&#39;s a crypto with high fees (BTC, ETH), I&#39;d either leave it on an exchange if it&#39;s there, wait until ETH 2.0 if it&#39;s ETH, or just send away if its so small that you won&#39;t get bummed out if you lost it.

                <p>I just started with crypto a month back and I just realized that my screen time for the past week was 13 hours on an average. Crypto market is just soo freaking addictive. I cant just put my phone down for more than 15 mins straight. And the fact that this market is open 24x7 365 certainly doesn&#39;t help either. I am simply loving it. Anyone else went through this stage when they started or should I be concerned about this?

                <p>this is in no way shape or form a good idea, just thought i&#39;d post this here because it&#39;s 6am and im doing fucking math on reddit crypto lmao.
 &#x200B;
 Anyways, right now a moon is worth about 8 cents. If you wanted to replace your full time job with raking in moons on reddit, it would take a lot of time and effort but here we go.
 The average hourly wage in the USA is ~$15. This means that at that wage you are making about 31,000 dollars a year. Now, going off of the math of 1 upvote = 0.48 moons…</p>

I just finished Karen Pryor’s “Don’t Shoot the Dog: the New Art of Teaching and Training.” Partly because a friend points out that it’s not on Audible and therefore she can’t possibly read it, here are the notes I took and some thoughts. It’s a quick, easy read.
The book applies behavioral psychology to training animals and people. The author started off as a dolphin trainer at an aquarium park in the 1960s and moved on to horses, dogs, and her own children. There are…</p>

                <p>In 2001, Seth MacFarlane was the 27-year-old executive producer and creator of the not-yet-hit animated show Family Guy. Having broken into the entertainment big leagues at such a young age, MacFarlane was invited back in September to address his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design. After giving a talk, he went out for what turned out to be a late night of drinking with some professors. 
The next morning, September 11, MacFarlane raced to catch an 8:15 a.m. flight out of Boston back to Los Angeles…</p>

                <p>In 1913, 26-year-old Russian biologist Nikolai Vavilov went to the John Innes Horticultural Institute to study at the feet of legendary geneticist William Bateson. While there, Vavilov attended lectures at nearby Cambridge University, and could often be seen bicycling around the city in his trademark suit and tie. He and Bateson became lifelong friends, and the Mendelian genetics that Bateson and his team championed—and that remains the core of the field of genetics to this day—was burned into Vavilov’s sci…</p>

                <p>I grew up in a small village in a very rural part of England. It was a landscape capped with the huge skies of a low-lying coastal zone. Gently rolling fields, long hedgerows, and a lot of farms. Some of the people running those farms came from so many generations that they could point to the sites of their forebears’ land-working going back over four centuries. As a child it was fascinating to hear the farmers reflect on the profound changes wrought to that land and their little-concealed wonderment at the…</p>

This is a story where the alignment problem is somewhat harder than I expect, society handles AI more competently than I expect, and the outcome is worse than I expect. It also involves inner alignment turning out to be a surprisingly small problem. Maybe the story is 10-20th percentile on each of those axes. At the end I’m going to go through some salient ways you could vary the story.

Most problems can be separated pretty cleanly into two categories: things we basically understand, and things we basically don’t understand. Some things we basically understand: building bridges and skyscrapers, treating and preventing infections, satellites and GPS, cars and ships, oil wells and gas pipelines and power plants, cell networks and databases and websites.

To evaluate whether a competing theory to dark matter is plausible, it's important to know what the actual arguments in favor of dark matter are in more detail than just "dark matter is the stuff you have to add to get galactic rotation curves to work out".
