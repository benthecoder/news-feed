              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Although BTC started to tank a little today, ETH just reached a new ATH around 2920$ it is so exciting to see it moving on its own. This is only good for the future of crypto as a whole.
 Maybe in the future this will change the time we spend at a bear market because not everything&#39;s tanking at the same time.

My guess is that he wanted me to speak of the advantages of using an ensemble of trees (along with randomly selected features and bagging) over a single tree. As for the distribution question, no clue and I can&#39;t find anything on Google.

 We all want this community and the market to grow. I also understand that you want your friends and family to catch this golden opportunity. But persuading them to put their money in something they’re uncommitted to, leads to FUD and paper hands.

 The problem is that now I’m the CRM admin. And we’re about to go from a company of 500 people to 5000 people, thanks to a dozen or more acquisitions coming up.

                <p>Idk if its just me - but does anyone else feel the same?
 These polls add nothing of value to the discussion but are still taking up the entire front page in place of quality content - I&#39;m getting serious flashbacks to when Moon farmers kept spamming memes the sub every weekend with the same recycled memes.
 Maybe these things could belong to a different sub and just be linked through a single post instead?

                <p>TIL that changing the order of features when calling the fit method of sklearn random forest regressor can lead to a different model, even if the seed and random_state is the same.
 For ex: 
  
Function call 1: RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42).fit(dataframe1[[feat1,feat2,feat3]])
 Function call 2: RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42).fit(dataframe1[[feat3,feat2,feat1]])
  
The models you will get from the above two functions will be different! This could be down to the random nature of the algorithm…</p>

 Studies show that 1 in 3 deaths in the United States is caused due to heart disease and stroke. It is observed that high blood pressure (HBP) is associated with specific cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors which vary in proportion from one environment to another.

 I have seen so many posts about people mistyping addresses and losing their crypto recently. I am posting this again before some dude inevitably does the same thing again.
 Paying fees twice is worth the peace of mind. If you&#39;re sending a small amount and it&#39;s a crypto with high fees (BTC, ETH), I&#39;d either leave it on an exchange if it&#39;s there, wait until ETH 2.0 if it&#39;s ETH, or just send away if its so small that you won&#39;t get bummed out if you lost it.

At the risk of sounding cliche, &#39;Enjoy the journey, not the destination&quot;. So here&#39;s my attempt at creating the problem-solving journey from what I&#39;ve experienced/learned/failed at.

 I have heard the developers in my company say it like ‘ES QUE EL’ but the data science/stat folk mostly say ‘SEQUEL’
 Which is the correct one??

                <p>Someone made a thread with this article and a very clickbaity title to entice and get reactions and comments from all of you (obviously for Moon farming). It got to the frontpage with about 8k upvotes. If you read the article you will see that:

It&#39;s from March 12, not recent.
 Any &quot;proposed bill&quot; needs to be approved by both legislature houses (House of Representatives and Senate). It was only approved on the House of Representatives, so it effectivelly wasn&#39;t &quot;passed&quo…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>I just started with crypto a month back and I just realized that my screen time for the past week was 13 hours on an average. Crypto market is just soo freaking addictive. I cant just put my phone down for more than 15 mins straight. And the fact that this market is open 24x7 365 certainly doesn&#39;t help either. I am simply loving it. Anyone else went through this stage when they started or should I be concerned about this?

              <summary>A guide to replacing your full time job with Reddit MOONs</summary>
              <div class="details-content">
                <p>this is in no way shape or form a good idea, just thought i&#39;d post this here because it&#39;s 6am and im doing fucking math on reddit crypto lmao.
 &#x200B;
 Anyways, right now a moon is worth about 8 cents. If you wanted to replace your full time job with raking in moons on reddit, it would take a lot of time and effort but here we go.
 The average hourly wage in the USA is ~$15. This means that at that wage you are making about 31,000 dollars a year. Now, going off of the math of 1 upvote = 0.48 moons…</p>
