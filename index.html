                <p>I&#39;ve had this (highly speculative) idea of AI research for a few years now, and would like to share this with the internet.
 I also can&#39;t imagine (almost sure) that this hasn&#39;t been thought of in some way or form already, who knows maybe someone already wrote a science fiction novel with this idea as it&#39;s basis, unbeknownst to me. In any case, I thought it might interest some, and I would enjoy anybodies thoughts on this subject.

                <p>Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) is defined as the quantity or ‚Äúburden‚Äù of mutations in a tumor. Researchers have demonstrated that a correlation exists between a larger number of tumor mutations and a positive response to specific immunotherapy drugs termed Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs). Therefore, TMB may be a good predictor of which patients will respond well to ICI therapy.

                <p>If so please comment on their uses, I occasionally use R and it feels weird that lm() is the only builtin ML function and yet I have so far found no real uses for (aside from perhaps simple forecasting and constrained optimization of a hidden function).
 I&#39;ve heard that Andrew Ng seems to find them useful enough that it is almost always the first thing he tries to solve a problem (probably for exploratory purposes). Can anyone comment on that?

 It&#39;s from a senior who&#39;s leaving the field...had worked for Tesla...a Kenyan fintech startup...It was quite a long post and I was going to save it for later but then I messed up.

 As a passionate computer science student, what are things I can do to best prepare for the next interview? I&#39;ve been reading up on SQL and have a good background in set theory as well.
 Thank you in advance!!

                <p>Hardware wallets are, without a doubt, the most secure way to store your crypto. Yet, at first, they can be rather confusing and I have certainly seen a lot of misconceptions around them in some posts. This guide is structured as a FAQ so you can jump to the sections of interest.

                <p>Banks are not our friends, but they are also not stupid. They see the writing on the wall and they are going to fight tooth and nail to retain the power they have in our society. I think that especially for boomers, the idea of keeping your Bitcoin &quot;safe in a bank&quot; is going to be appealing, and perhaps it will drive adoption I to the mainstream. But don&#39;t forget that centralized banking systems are the enemy here.

                <p>Staking is a phenomenal way for the average person to make money. By staking you are 1. Contributing to something bigger then you and most importantly 2. You will make as much as if you were invested in an ETF in the stock market. Yes the price of the coin can go down which is a notable risk factor. However, staking the right coin is a very great opportunity which everyone should at least look into.
 Edit: Made a new post explaining staking simply. Go into my profile to find it :)
