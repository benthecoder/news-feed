 A number of volunteers (product, software, management backgrounds) are trying to build a model to predict how Oxygen demand will shape. When supplies improve, they wish to be able to help agencies distribute to the correct places, logistics issue as you might imagine. There is a model they are trying to build but too many unknown variables/uncertainties.

 If you have used Reddit itself for making models, what models did you make and how did you go about data cleansing?

 Few days ago I posted about the crypto address for covid donations for India.
 I said that I will be donating the equivalent amount in fiat. I got 33 upvotes~ 20 moons~ 2 USD max .
 I donated 20 USD. Here&#39;s the proof:https://ibb.co/Lg0YKxj

                <p>edit: Putting this at the top as requested - I&#39;m not saying TrueBit as a company/technology is a scam.
 This post is highlighting that the contract which launched today may be an imposter contract due to the lack of official sources commenting on/linking to the contract address, and the fact that it&#39;s just an OpenZeppelin contract, unmodified. You will get banned from the &quot;unofficial&quot; telegram group for pointing this out.
 TrueBit&#39;s website also removed their &quot;watch out for scams …</p>

 Coins are cryptocurrencies that have their own ecosystem. For example, Cardano, Ethereum, bitcoin, etc. are all coins because they have their own blockchain and don’t depend on other blockchains.
 Tokens on the other hand are currencies built on other currencies’ blockchain. For example, USDT is built on ethereum blockchain which means it’s a token of ethereum network.

 I&#39;ve developed an app that uses the latest advancement in text generation AI (GPT-3) to find ideas, recipes, captions for photos, and much more, just from your inputs.
 I&#39;m trying to constantly improve the outputs of the generator, but the project is young and I need feedback as much as possible.

                <p>Disgust may not be a straightforward extension of the immune system’s aversion to harmful substances, but rather “a psychological nebula, lacking definite boundaries, discrete internal structure, or a single center of gravity,” says psychologist Nina Strohminger.Photograph by Star Stock / Flickr
Nina Strohminger, perhaps not unlike many fans of raunchy comedies and horror flicks, is drawn to disgust. The University of Pennsylvania psychologist has written extensively on the feeling of being grossed out, and…</p>

                <p>In 2001, Seth MacFarlane was the 27-year-old executive producer and creator of the not-yet-hit animated show Family Guy. Having broken into the entertainment big leagues at such a young age, MacFarlane was invited back in September to address his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design. After giving a talk, he went out for what turned out to be a late night of drinking with some professors. 
The next morning, September 11, MacFarlane raced to catch an 8:15 a.m. flight out of Boston back to Los Angeles…</p>

                <p>In 1913, 26-year-old Russian biologist Nikolai Vavilov went to the John Innes Horticultural Institute to study at the feet of legendary geneticist William Bateson. While there, Vavilov attended lectures at nearby Cambridge University, and could often be seen bicycling around the city in his trademark suit and tie. He and Bateson became lifelong friends, and the Mendelian genetics that Bateson and his team championed—and that remains the core of the field of genetics to this day—was burned into Vavilov’s sci…</p>

Gently rolling fields, long hedgerows, and a lot of farms. Some of the people running those farms came from so many generations that they could point to the sites of their forebears’ land-working going back over four centuries. As a child it was fascinating to hear the farmers reflect on the profound changes wrought to that land and their little-concealed wonderment at the…</p>

This is a story where the alignment problem is somewhat harder than I expect, society handles AI more competently than I expect, and the outcome is worse than I expect. It also involves inner alignment turning out to be a surprisingly small problem. Maybe the story is 10-20th percentile on each of those axes. At the end I’m going to go through some salient ways you could vary the story.

                <p>It all started with an odd pile of shells: a pile that, upon closer inspection, fell apart like a flower losing its petals, introducing a burned-out nature documentarian named Craig Foster—and, in time, the world—to the octopus hiding cleverly inside.
Known simply as “her,” she would become the star of My Octopus Teacher, the Oscar-nominated Netflix documentary and surprise pandemic hit that told the story of Foster’s unlikely relationship with that eight-armed mollusk.

                <p>Like most American high school students, I was required to take Chemistry and English. Chemistry thrilled only by way of the absurdity of allowing kids like me to play with volatile compounds and an open flame. English provided little of that thrill save, perhaps, Holden Caulfield’s excessive swearing or Huckleberry Finn’s audacity in heading down the big river after faking his own death.
I took Mark Twain’s advice to heart and decided I would not let school get in the way of my education. So in lieu of col…</p>

                <p>It might surprise you to find out how little evidence there is to support the idea that boosting students’ “grit”—their propensity to tenaciously attack difficult problems they encounter rather than give up—is a reliably effective way to improve their school performance or to close long-standing education gaps. After all, you’ve probably heard otherwise. Grit is everywhere. By the time you read this, it will have been a golden child of the world of education for well over a decade.
