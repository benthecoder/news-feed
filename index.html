                              <span>So I am interested in working with text data from the web. I had one very small project where I used a text mining model in R a while ago. Now I would like do this in Python but I&#x27;m still quite new to the field which is why I would like to have a smooth und easy start. I want to do sentiment analysis on (social) media data related to political and economic topics or maybe something like product and hotel reviews. Can you give me any advice on which APIs and Python libraries I should work with to conduct this with a few lines of code?

                              <span>I completed my first web scraping/data analysis project in Python! It grabs home listings from a local real estate site and compares their prices! I would love to hear if anyone has any feedback on anything at all— I’m still pretty new to Python and would appreciate some constructive criticism. I know the project isn’t very useful in the long run, but I learned a lot in the process! :) Would a project like this be good enough to show a potential internship?

Currently I&#x27;m also a CS major and plan on doing software engineering as a career but I&#x27;m also interested in going into data science in the future so wanna know which one is more appealing
 Also which masters is better CS, Stats, or Data science

                              <span>Hey all, 
 Recently at work, I&#x27;ve been muling over how there are many Data Analysts / Data Scientists both where I work and in the industry in general who don&#x27;t have a good grasp for what it means to be competent with python. 
 ​
 I&#x27;m sure we are all familiar with the person who only uses jupyter notebooks, pandas, numpy, and sklearn. Said person believes they are great at python simply because they don&#x27;t know what they don&#x27;t know. 
 ​
 Recently, there was another thread in r/datascience (link here), where u/valkaress asked the community about how persons new to the industry should focus their learning and this made me realize that there are probably many data scientists and even senior data scientists who use python frequently but due to lack of exposure where they work, their python skills are behind industry expectations. 
 ​
 To understand if this is true, I have made a survey to better understand just how much python the average person in this sub knows. Survey Here
 ​
 I&#x27;d love it if I could get at least 50 responses - I plan to share the results of this survey in this sub for all to see. 
 ​
 Feel free to drop a comment if you liked / disliked the survey.

 Did one ML model fit on all the data to forecast accurately for all products? Or multiple models were trained specifically for every product/store? What loss function/metrics were used? 
 It will be great to hear your experiences.

 Any code online reproducing what exactly the researchers did? Possibly with a different dataset.

                              <span>If you have a calculated column that has undefined values, how can you use that column in an analysis (specifically regression or random forest) when the fact that a value is undefined could be important?
 There&#x27;s a few options I know of, but each have pitfalls:
  
Use the columns that create the calculated column. Downside: often these values are colinear
 Replace undefined with 0s. Downside: this can skew the data toward 0 which reduces accuracy
 Remove rows with undefined values. Downside: Smaller datasets don&#x27;t have this option, and even in large ones, undefined values could be a strong indicator
  
I&#x27;ve considered the option of converting undefined into 0s and adding a binary column that marks true for previously undefined values, but I can&#x27;t find resources on that so I&#x27;m not sure it would be legit.
 How have you dealt with undefined data? At some point do you just need to pick the best option for your data even though none are perfect?
 EDIT: By undefined, I am specifically talking about x/0 errors. For example, percentage columns in a marketing report where 0 leads converted from a campaign, but there were also 0 leads acquired.

                              <span>Ugh. So, I went through all the lectures and examples provided for Central Michigan&#x27;s ML and AI boot camp which, although much more expensive than a Udemy class, are not as high quality. The classes are hosted on Ed2go. Now, for a capstone project, to pass the class, I need to design models to take video input of from driver POV and overlay on an output video the current speed of the vehicle, boxes around the signs with sign classification, and road edges / centerline lines. I am starting with the speed detection using a a dataset I found by commaai on GitHub. Thing is, there was never any discussion about how to preprocess video to get it into an RNN. We discussed how RNN&#x27;s work but not much preprocessing. Are there any keras preprocessing layers anyone would suggest? Speed detection is not really an image classification problem. I have at least split the video into an array of frame data using openCV already. This capstone seems very advanced compared to the instruction given. 
 P.s. I only took the class because the state offered to pay for it and it sounded interesting. After it started they informed me that I I don&#x27;t pass the final I will have to pay it all back. So, let&#x27;s just say there is strong monetary motivation to figure this out.

 I am building a project where I will track what types of requests made, when and other type of data. 
 I am willing to provide user dashboards and insights. 
 So questions are following: * can I use mongodb timeseries data for this ? Or I should look into something else ? * can I stick only with typescript solving these problems or I better start looking into python? * in general: what kind of challenges I might face when tackling this problem ? 
 Thank you for your insights, Merry Christmas

I&#x27;m having a hard time managing time, that&#x27;s why l ask and I feel like I&#x27;m just not studying enough.
 So, . On an average how many hours a day?

 The two large state schools near me offer BS and MS in Data Science. I&#x27;m thinking about applying for these programs but the expense is immense and I already have a degree with a lot of math electives and some programming experience.
 Thanks for reading.

 Does anyone have experience or knowledge of the best way to do this? I would use yolo to detect the object(person), crop where the bounding box is and then play with aspect ratio. Any insight is appreciated. Happy holidays!

                              <span>Hello, I’m currently an undergrad systems engineering and psychology major with a minor in mathematics who has hopes of going to grad school. I want to be a “data scientist” (quotes because the role can be different titles based on the company). For the longest time I’ve been interested in the computational and statistical aspects of data science, as well as computational social science and behavioral data science. I am also heavily interested in the intersection of social and computational science, but can’t seem to find a direct degree path for such a career. Through my engineering program, i’ve had experience with R, Python, SAS, MATLABs, and some brief machine learning projects. We’ve also covered research design and experimentation. 
 I was thinking about what program I’d like to go f…</span>

                              <span>Hello! I have two offers for a summer 2023 data science internship. I accepted an offer for BNY Mellon&#x27;s START Data science internship but I got an offer for JP Morgan&#x27;s AI and Data Science Analyst program. My goal is to work with AI in the future. I&#x27;m not sure if JPM is worth reneging on BNY Mellon though since they both seem like good internship programs. 
 ​
 BNY Mellon START: 
 - Ideal location in NYC because I would be able to commute from home and spend more time with my family
 - talked to some past interns who enjoyed their experience 
 - pay: $48 an hour
 - I already accepted this offer
 ​
 JP Morgan 
 - In Chicago. My ideal location is NYC but spending a summer in Chicago would be very fun as well! 
 - It seems like the internship projects JPM interns are placed on are more impactful than those of BNY Mellon based on my conservations during the interviews. 
 - Pay: $45 an hour (a bit lower than BNY Mellon&#x27;s)
 - more prestigious?

                              <span>I just wanted to let any HN users who are alone for the holidays - maybe even without a place to stay - that I want to make sure you have a good meal in your stomach tomorrow night and that you know that there are others who do care.
HN has been an incredible resource for me. I have met friends, cofounders, and business partners on this site. My intellectual curiousity has been somewhat sated and my social circle made richer by this site’s very existence. I myself have gone through tough times and spent multiple holiday seasons on the street. I want you to know there are people out there who care about you and believe in you.
If you need food to celebrate the holidays (or another resource, such as housing help for the night) please email me at the address in my bio. You may remain as anonymous as you wish, so long as I have enough information to get you the assistance you desire.
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays.

                              <span>Just wanted to wish everybody here a Merry Christmas. HN is one of those Internet communities which I would be the saddest to see go, even looking back on other communities in which I&#x27;ve participated over the years.
I see many posts here about loneliness, nihilism, friendships (or lack thereof) and just wanted to let everybody here know that life is never hopeless, and there are always people who care, even if they&#x27;re thousands of miles away.
Please reach out to loved ones this season and let them know you love them. Life is short, and you never know when the last time you&#x27;ll be wishing somebody a Merry Christmas will be.
I wish you all the very best for 2023.

                              <span>What does everyone think of the YouChat bot on You. com search site. 
 You.com, which says it reaches over 1 million actively searching users and has grown over 400% in the last six months . 
 I tested their ChatGPT alternative and found it half-decent. 
 I&#x27;m curious as to what others think?
 The background is You.com, the search engine startup founded in 2020 with a moonshot bid to take on Google, announced today that it has opened its search platform to allow external developers and organizations to build their own apps for the search results page. 
 This includes generative AI apps, it says, that have never been seen inside traditional search engines, using generative AI technology that enables users to generate text (YouWrite), code (YouCode), or images (YouImagine) from plain English — all within the search results page. 
 You can try it out here, let me know if the link works: https://you.com/search?q&#x3D;who+are+you&amp;tbm&#x3D;youchat
 It says: 👋 Hello! My name is YouChat, I’m an AI that can answer general questions, explain things, suggest ideas, translate, summarize text, compose emails, and write code for you. I’m powered by artificial intelligence and natural language processing, allowing you to have human-like conversations with me. I am constantly learning from huge amounts of information on the internet, which means I sometimes may get some answers wrong. My AI is always improving and I will often share sources for my answers. 
 In 2023 there are going to be so many tools like this to be fair paired with Search.

                              <span>I&#x27;m fighting the usual existential crisis due to AI and I drown my sorrows with magic mushrooms. Hear me out with this speculation for the future.
 I think we all agree AI is just getting better. I heard that theory that next generation of startups might be companies that build hyper-specific layers for AI (eg. a law firm building lawyer app). If we keep on this path large models based on curated data, then even if AI gets better it&#x27;ll stay kinda samey. Plus we might also have a built-in watermark for the generated text.
 But what if AI being too consistent gets to people. I can see myself reading AI generated emails a few years from now and just seeing at a glance the dry lingo and winding lines of text with minimal meaning. What if people just counter that by being inconsistent, I can see myself adding little flairs to my emails to make sure the reader knows I&#x27;m a human. I imagine this is how artists might adapt, if their style is too generic and AI begins to be a major competitor, they might just stylize more.
 I&#x27;d draw parallel between this and zoomer humor. There&#x27;s just stuff in there I don&#x27;t find funny, but zoomers do because the goal was to create something they can call their own. So maybe humans adapt by becoming more human, I dunno. I&#x27;m still high off mushrooms and just wanted to textualize my thoughts.

                              <span>Hey, I think I remember their being SD models that are trainable in a reasonable amount of time. Maybe the trade-off was they are not text conditioned? If that&#x27;s the case, can you point me toward a keras model or similar? 
 I really want to train my own (from scratch, not transfer learning) and make some modifications. Thank you!
